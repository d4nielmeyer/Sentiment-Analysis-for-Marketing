# Growth Hacking with NLP and Sentiment Analysis
This repo was made to the liveProject
[Growth Hacking with NLP and Sentiment Analysis](https://liveproject.manning.com/project/136).

In this liveProject, the goal is to gain an overall impression of the job of a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialist** working on the Growth Hacking Team of a freshly launched startup that is introducing a new video game to the market. One of the key targets of a growth hacking team is to enhance the massive growth of early startups in a short time. To do so, it introduces strategies with the help of which one can acquire as many customers as possible with the lowest cost as possible. As part of the team’s growth hacking strategy, the boss wants to map the field of the video game market. She aims to find out how customers evaluate the competitors’ products, namely what they like and dislike in a video game. Knowing what makes a video game attractive to a gamer helps the marketing team articulate the message of your product more effectively.

To be able to find out what makes a video game worth buying according to gamers, it is required to get deeper insights into the linguistic features of their utterances. As an NLP Specialist, the task will be to *analyze customers’ reviews* about video games. In order to carry out this task, different NLP methods needs to be employed. These methods will enable to acquire a deeper understanding of customer feedback and opinion.

## Project Outline:

The project is made up of five steps, which are built on each other:

* Creating the dataset.
* Creating a dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
* Evaluating the dictionary-based sentiment analyzer.
* Creating neural network-based sentiment analyzers.
* Reporting the results.

## Tech Stack:

* *Google Colab*: for writing and executing the code
* *Jupyter*: for running Jupyter Notebooks
* *NLTK*: for doing basic sentiment analysis
* *pandas*: for storing the data as a dataframe
* *scikit-learn*: for evaluating the results
* *Imbalanced-learn*: for sampling from the Amazon review dataset
* *PyTorch*, *transformers*, and *simpletransformers*: for building the sentiment classifier and for using the distilbert model
* *Altair*: for visualization
* *nbconvert*: for turning Jupyter Notebooks into presentations
