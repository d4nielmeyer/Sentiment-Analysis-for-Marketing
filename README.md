# Growth Hacking with NLP and Sentiment Analysis
This repo was made to the liveProject
[Growth Hacking with NLP and Sentiment Analysis](https://liveproject.manning.com/project/136).

In this liveProject, the boss of a freshly launched startup that is introducing a new video game to the marketwants wants to map the field of the video game market. The aim is to find out how customers evaluate the competitors’ products, namely what they like and dislike in a video game. Knowing what makes a video game attractive to a gamer helps the marketing team articulate the message of your product more effectively.

To be able to find out what makes a video game worth buying according to gamers, it is required to get deeper insights into the linguistic features of their utterances. As an NLP Specialist, the task will be to *analyze customers’ reviews* about video games. In order to carry out this task, different NLP methods needs to be employed. These methods will enable to acquire a deeper understanding of customer feedback and opinion.

## Project Outline:

The project is made up of five steps, which are built on each other:

* Creating the dataset
* Creating a dictionary-based sentiment analyzer
* Evaluating the dictionary-based sentiment analyzer
* Creating neural network-based sentiment analyzers
* Reporting the results

## Tech Stack:

* *Google Colab*: for writing and executing the code
* *Jupyter*: for running Jupyter Notebooks
* *NLTK*: for doing basic sentiment analysis
* *pandas*: for storing the data as a dataframe
* *scikit-learn*: for evaluating the results
* *Imbalanced-learn*: for sampling from the Amazon review dataset
* *PyTorch*, *transformers*, and *simpletransformers*: for building the sentiment classifier and for using the distilbert model
* *Altair*: for visualization
* *nbconvert*: for turning Jupyter Notebooks into presentations
