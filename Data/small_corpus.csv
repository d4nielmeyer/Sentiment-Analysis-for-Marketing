0,1,"Recently UBISOFT had to settle a huge class-action suit brought against the company for bundling (the notoriously harmful) StarFORCE DRM with its released games. So what the geniuses at the helm do next? They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!

MASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, ""hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?""

The original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to ""Sell-Sell!-SELL!!"" instead of posting this...

Ever since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with ""fighting piracy"". All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.
That is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.

Lately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM's backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.

And the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I 'll pass this one too.

The only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games ""protected"" by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly ""protected"" by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!
To everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further. And the best way to resolve such issues is market correction.

That is why it is important for gamers to keep voting with their wallets. And as with any vote, well informed decisions are paramount in making the right choice."
1,1,"code didn't work, got me a refund."
2,1,"these do not work at all, all i get is static and they came with nothing in the box to give any help."
3,1,"well let me start by saying that when i first started this game up i was so excited, but when i started playing OMG was i pissed off. The graphics where that of a xbox original, i am not joking they are some of the WORST graphics i have seen in a long time. NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that won't really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.

I forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.

SO this game is pretty much a FAIL on every level, its a broken game, But lets hope that resident evil 6 will make up for this REALLY REALLY BAD GAME"
4,1,"Dont waste your money, you will just end up using the nunchuck, or a classic controler in the end, and more over don't waste your money on the new Mario Cart, just keep, or get one of the older ones, its just recycled maps with new controls that aren't that good anyways."
5,1,i ordered this and said it was tested and worked but it didn't work in my 64
6,1,"UPDATE, 2010:  This review is pretty old, and now that we're in 2010 and I'm on even better hardware, I've had a chance to revisit Halo 2.  I still ran into DRM issues with the re-install, and if you already have Games for Windows Live you're going to find installing Halo 2 nearly impossible (I'll post details in the comments)...but if you can get it going in Windows 7, things do get better.  In the past month or so, I only lost my savegames on the Live server twice and have only had it crash itself once.  That said, here is the original review.  I hope it is helpful for you.

I bought Halo 2 for the PC excited about trying it on my brand-new Vista machine.  I have had it for over a year now and have yet to be able to actually play the game all the way through.
I went through the agony of having to create a Live account, and then having the game not ""see"" the account (but not let me log in because I'm ""already logged in"").  I experienced the unfun joys of having Halo 2 randomly tell me my savegame file is corrupted and I have to start again.  I had updates crash the game, my license key invalidate itself, and after unanswered support e-mails, it took me multiple calls and over 3 hours on the phone to get someone to fix the problem.  They had to do this by removing my license key, issuing me a new one, and telling me I'd lose all my ""achievements"" and account info.  That wasn't a great loss, since the program would regularly log me into Live, then say, ""You are not logged into Live.  You will not be able to have any Achievements.  Sorry about that.""  A lot of the messages I get in Halo 2 say, ""Sorry about that.""  Sorry, indeed.

By the time I actually got the game to work (with shuddering framerate and random dropouts in sound), I was just angry.  Angry at all the ""Sorry"" messages, angry at the hassle I have to click through just to load a saved game, and angry at the constant savegame level resets.  I see new Microsoft Games for Windows titles, and I feel I'd be stupid to put risk putting myself through that again."
7,1,I WISH I COULD GET RID OF IT!!
8,1,What in the hell is this i can say that some of it looks like part 5 but come on capcom now what happened now the only thing good on here is the demo to revelations and it's 40 dollars in the store now 3D or not the game isn't worth it and the revelations demo is fun but i couldn't beat it and plus if you buy it used you cant delete the last persons information in the game so you have to keep going where they left off
9,1,"Could be a lot better with different surface material. Just felt weird in my hand with the glossyness to it. If it were all rough and not those ""rubber"" sides it would be OK."
10,1,"i need to remind myself not to get dlc or season pass anymore, because dlc maps are terrible compare to base game maps

when mw2 stimulus dlc came out, i got that dlc.  dlc maps were uninspiring.  then in mw3, i told myself to give dlc maps one more chance and got dlc1,2,4.  still dlc maps were uninspiring compare to base game maps

now, i was crazy enough to get season pass for ghosts =.="" (facepalm)  what then, dlc 1 maps were not fun at all (compare to base game).  the only thing good was extinction episode 1.

i find myself play more of base game maps than dlc maps.  i probably will not get dlc maps anymore..."
11,1,"I just bought this game for gamerscore and wow was it a bad game. I can't beleive that anyone would think that this game is fun. The game is very glitchy, unbalanced, and the graphics are terrible. Do not buy this game unless you just want gamerscore from it!"
12,1,"This game is poorly crafted and I will not be buying anything made by Blizzard for a long time, maybe even never again as they've obviously changed their standards to conform to profit-margin agenda of the corporation that bought them."
13,1,"Looks cute, quirky and fun.  Shame I won't be buying it until EA wakes up and figures out that punishing paying customers and rewarding piracy isn't really a good business strategy.  DURH!  Doesn't help that they are being very belligerent and arrogant about it, basically telling paying customers ""Tough poopies if you don't like DRM.  What you think doesn't really matter.  Just keep giving us money."""
14,1,"The Mic stopped working within 20 minutes of use. I am very disappointed with this item. I have used turtle beach in the past, and had nothing but but amazing things to say about them. Looks like it is time to find a new company to support..."
15,1,"For the better part of an entire year, I was hyped up to this game.  The announcement that there would be no Knockouts was the only thing that soured me a bit.

Then I read a Midway Q&A session on IGN.com regarding the game, and almost every response Midway gave either consisted of ""No, this game will not feature that"" or ""We hope to include that in the next game!""

Missing a lot of things though it may be, Midway showed just how much fail is in this product when they spend an opportunity to hype it up by basically crapping all over it and all but telling us ""don't buy this yet---it's only the beta version of the sequel coming in four or ten years~!""

Then the game itself.  The graphics are good, but what game isn't these days?  You can't give a game a pretty rating just for graphics alone---imagine how Final Fantasy: Spirits Unleashed would have been received if the graphics of the movie were considered a part of how good it was.

Even then, the graphics look nowhere near as good as the now-apparent pre-rendered screenshots plastered across the internet.  I absolutely could not tell that James Storm character was supposed to be James Storm, while for the most part, all the wrestlers look how they're supposed to, but don't break the barrier of shock and awe.  They are more in the league of Smackdown vs Raw 2007 or 2008.

That said, compensation appears to be made for the above-average graphics, by immense cuts in game content.  25 superstars is no real big deal.  When all those superstars have the exact same generic taunts and the same puddle of moves to pick from, THAT is a big deal.  A bad big deal.

The controls are a sloppy and contorted mess.  Arguably this could be from a several year-long accustomment to the controls in WWE games from Day of Reckoning to Smackdown vs Raw 2008, but either way, it's simply not very functional for the R button to be for running, and for the strong-grapple button to be on the opposite side of the controller from the base grapple button itself.

The controls are designed in such a way that it will take a very long time to grow accustomed to them, much less to master them.  Maybe this is due to my clumsiness and retard-fingers, but even I was able to get over the switch of L button for blocking strikes, R button for blocking grapples in SvR07 after a transition from WWE Day of Reckoning 2 (where it was the other way around) within a short while of gameplay.  As such, when you are thrust into the ring early on, your only chance of winning is the basic punch/kick/basic grapple until you can figure out how to do more complex maneuvers without the computer utterly destroying you while you stand around stupidly.

The moves actions in-game are indeed fluid, but only for as long as the opponent is standing.  As soon as they are knocked down and fail to immediately come back up, the fluidity is broken.  As far as I can tell, there is absolutely no way to pick your opponent up when they've fallen---only to stomp or punch them, drop elbows or whatever other thing, or do ground grapples involving the exact same arm locks and such.

The ""fluid"" motions as well must be fluid if you consider just how slowly they come about.  The controls do not react immediately, and once you've set about trying to perform a punch or a grapple, there is no going back.  As such, if you're lightning-fast on your button mashing like I am, you'll be angered to no end by how sloppily your character tries a meek little punch, only for the enemy to back away quickly, then come right back up and hit you while you're still recovering from throwing that first punch.

Midway apparently HAS reason to brag about how ""fluid"" their grapples are as well---there are only about two or three of them the player can perform!  Compared to the dozen or so that can be done in the WWE equivalent, the game pretty much only needs one button and two directions on the analog stick to fluidly perform the exact same suplex or jawbreaker or hurricanrana quickly and efficiently.

Counters are apparently the only area where the uniqueness of TNA's in-ring talent is on display.  Amazingly, the moves are all very ordinary and basic, whereas the counters show off some of the most insane, unique, and innovative maneuvers TNA wrestlers can do.  Counters.

The sound is terrible.  Obviously something like sound isn't really of big importance to a game that does it right, but in this game they've really done something wrong for sound to get mention.  The audience has only three or four noises they make---and they are NOISES, because this crowd never quiets down or gets louder---the generic white noise of screaming, a gasping sound effect used millions of times in various movies and TV shows for the past hundred years, and slightly noisier, but no more louder, cheering.  The punch/kick sounds are comical in nature, sounding like something you'd hear in Street Fighter II or Final Fight for SNES.

I COULD have given the game a two or even three star rating if not for the crux of the massive bag of issues this game is; the fact that the opponent will seemingly always be better than you no matter what, always.

I started the game playing as Chris Sabin vs Shark Boy, and in said match, I was very new and experienced.  I tried a balanced workout of punches and kicks first, followed by experimenting with grapples, and trying to figure out how to do other grapple moves.  Not only did I utterly fail to do anything but snap suplexes, but because I was kicking the crap out of Shark Boy with only the most basic of moves, he easily countered some of them, built up a full iMPACT! bar, and performed his finisher and pinned me for three.

The next match I was AJ Styles vs Rhino.  This bout went even shorter, as despite the fact that we both battled each other equally, my pins barely made two, whereas Rhino's one pin got me at 3 in less than 3 minutes.

Then I go to story mode, where the most damning thing happens:  I spend a good 15 minutes utterly destroying this obese clown named ""Benny"" or some generic name like that, with 80% of all strikes and moves in this match being done by me on him, and I grab him up in my finisher and pin him, and he kicks out.  After a more sustained and concentrated beating, not only does he kick out AGAIN, but he manages to pull off his finisher on ME and PIN ME FOR THREE!  After getting in almost NO offense, he somehow BEATS ME!

This happened THREE TIMES IN A ROW!  After finally beating him somehow, I move on, and THE SAME THING HAPPENS!  I squash my next opponent, and yet they perform enough moves on me (seven moves on me out of 6000 on him is still enough to get you a full iMPACT! bar) to perform his finisher and beat me.

UPDATE: This only seems to get worse as you progress in storyline, as bigger-name stars are even bigger jerkasses to beat, as in one scenario where I LITERALLY squashed James Storm (as in, got over 90% of the matches' offensive moves placed on him), and just because he managed to counter 10% of my moves, HE is able to get a finisher, hit it on me, and pin me for three.  Trying to break out of a pin by wiggling the control stick is such a frantic ordeal, I've cut the skin of my palm just trying to keep an opponent down for a pin by wiggling the control stick.  Or rather, smashing it back and forth wildly.

This is pure BS.  When you're pinned, the game gives you a motion of the analog stick wiggling back and forth in order to break the pin.  The only problem is it doesn't tell you WHICH analog stick this is, and ""wiggling it gently"" is as effective as not wiggling it at all---you have to ram it back and forth as fast as you can.

And so, Midway releases to us a Beta test of a future release.  And it is a great many things; and many of those things are what was once just a verb, but has now become a noun as well: Fail."
16,1,"DOnt get me wrong , i loved all the CIV games so far .
But this one has nothing new expect the moments and the stacking .

The rest is only for the worse , it keep stuck and hang .
Crash , maps get crazy all of the sudden ...

Not a fun game play , they removed the religion ...

I played it for 3 days and will probably let it gather dust ...

waste of 40$ ..... Could have buy some beer and be more happy that way"
17,1,it wouldnt play on my older desktop and it won't play on my new laptop so you must have to have a super computer to play the game.
18,1,too graphic intense and I'm too cheap to go buy a $200 video card and a Quad Core cuz you need it!
19,1,"Game is not fun, and the package did not come as described"
20,1,Stupid
21,1,"I can't speak for the PlayStation 2 or the XBOX versions of this game, but as for the PC version which I've experienced, there is no reason to buy it whatsoever. The game suffers from one fatal flaw, you cannot adjust the controls for this game. When I plug in my Logitech F310 Gamepad, the controls are preset and cannot be changed. The same problem exists with the Scarface game, on PC you cannot adjust the controls to your preferences after plugging in a Logitech Gamepad. I don't know why. You can adjust the controls for all of the Grand Theft Auto games on the PC. But The Matrix Path of Neo and Scarface, you cannot adjust the controls. I am completely unwilling to sit through more than 2 hours of either of these games if I can't adjust the controls to my preferences. I can't have any fun shooting, running, driving, or performing combo attack moves with the preset controls on either game. The controls are awkward! They don't feel right. After just 2 days of owning it, I donated this game to charity and I've never looked back."
22,1,"I've played all the other titles of this series, well the ps2/1 versions anyway, and I've enjoyed all those, but this one is hard to enjoy. I don't mind a bit of a challenge, but damn, this is beyond that.
The enemies take many, many hits, you feel as if you're in a boss battle with each one.
The lack of supplies doesn't help much, neither does the wonky combat controls and whatnot.
I've been giving it a chance, but, thinking of trading it in to a place near here."
23,1,"Coulda-Shoulda been the game of the year for PC instead a huge disappointment from IW.
I've bought and supported Infinity Ward since Call of Duty 1 and can't believe they did this.
Single player was 5 Star but Multiplayer (the reason you buy the game) is a 1 Star- if that.

It's like xbox only worse and the host always has the advantage if you can stand to sit through the matchmaking, host quitting and the rest of the P2P problems.

I can't believe they did this to us.

One word: greed"
24,1,"THPS2 was fun. The levels made sense, the physics were completely unreal (fun) and the locations had some sort of skatepark or something interesting going on. The locations in THPS3 are lacking. A few are fun, but the majority are chaotic and seem to be designed purely with aggravation in mind. The airport is a great example. The physics have changed for the worse. You feel like your controlling a big sack of lead, and you will fall constantly. The controls are not configurable, and the setup for doing tricks is more a game of hitting things in the correct sequence than any sort of creative use of the terrain. On the technical side, this is one of two PS2 games I've seen crash. Shipping a game that crashes is totally unacceptable, but this level of workmanship seems to be a major theme in THPS3. Overall I'm pretty annoyed with my purchase, and would recommend staying away from this title. Don't even waste your money on a rental. Hopefully some developer as talented as the SSX people will come out with a good skater."
25,1,"just ""Meh"".  Despite the fact that the cursor flies across the screen at light speed even on it's lowest settings, the game is virtually impossible to play without getting ticked off.  So whatever.  1 star!"
26,1,"In fact, it is very disappointing to series going down hill. Nothing innovative anymore. I remember original Halo was such a great name, I stay all night finish it. Now it is nothing but garbage. COD MW 1&2 make this gameplay like a childplay. Rent it if you want."
27,1,"Piece of trash.

Keeps disconnecting my controller.

Bought el-cheapo no-name USB Bluetooth dongle, it works 100% of the time, no disconnections.

Complete let down and cannot recommend."
28,1,As you can tell by the last 20 or so posts this seller is selling counterfeit Wii Nunchuks. which are made every more poorly than unapproved 3rd party accessories. besides the retail price on a Nintendo made one is $19.99 so why would you pay more ? go down to your local store and buy a legit one for less....!
29,1,"Let me start off by saying, I really thought this game had potential but in the end it looks like just another half hearted attempt...

Ok, let us begin with the good. You can play as any character from the series  in any of the games! Good graphics. Create a fighter mode.

The bad- Fighting is absolutely terrible, even worse then the previous games. Now it feels like one of the old Tekken rip offs from the arcades that was only a quarter to play. You can have your weapon out and use it the whole round. You can be knocked into hot lava and killed after 1 hit!

There are no specific fatalities at all, the characters have lost their sense of identity. The value and presence of projectiles is next to nil, Shall I continue?

Overall, this game looks and smells like a weak cash grab from a strugging franchise. You will be happier and still $40 wealthier playing UMK3 from the PS1!@"
30,1,"I think we have all become so used to wireless controllers, when I saw this on Vine, I almost laughed out loud.  I mean really, a wired controller seems so OLD I thought.  But then I started reading the reviews and thought, ""Hey, I might need to check this out"".

I'm glad I did.

I must say, that the standard Xbox One controllers are very nice.  However, that glowing orb in the middle of the controller has always bothered me when I play in near total darkness.  So I also thought, this controller with lights would be the same way.  Not so.

The fact that you can cycle through colors, schemes and see the innerworkins of the controller make this a great addition to your console, regardless of whether it is wired or not.  It feels steady and well built in your hand and has held up to even the most brutal online matches I've put it through.  While I will say there is no perceptible increase in advantage over wireless, this thing just looks amazing so I will keep using it.

EDIT:  December 12, 2015

Had to reduce it to 1 star.  Controller lasted less than 3 weeks before something has gone awry with the L-Stick making it unusable."
31,1,To the fanboys of this game you are all in denial because you people don't know what a great wrestling is game this one is not it because the ai in season mode is very cheap and I had play this game on the easiet setting and still lossed I picked triple hhh kevin nash john cena goldberg the undertaker brock lesnar and still didnot win in season mode the intro is the worst intro of any wrestling game ever the legends in this game donot have any music at all the black and purple undertaker doesn't lod don't hillbilly jim doesn't the million dollar man ted dibiase don't either and to me that is just very stupid and it doesnot make any sense what so ever their are much better wrestling games out there than this overrated piece of garbage wcw nwo revenge wcw vs nwo world tour wrestlemania 2000 wwf no mercy smackdown shut your mouth smackdown 1 and 2 smackdown vs raw 2006 and 2010 wwf royal rumble genesis snes wwf raw genesis snes wrestlemania the arcade game genesis playstation sega saturn are all alot better than smackdown here comes the pain anyday of the week.
32,1,Just purchased this thing a few hours ago. I have yet to see it work. It's going back to the store.
33,1,"Was waiting for this mouse anxiously because my Razer Taipan was spoilt and Razer ask me to pay for shipping back to USA  in order to RMA. (I live on the other side of the world in Singapore) So I plugged in this mouse and the cursor doesn't move at all although the left and right mouse buttons were working fine. Took me 20 minutes of reinstalling synapse 2.0 and 3.0 and uninstall the mouse and repeat everything all over again to realise that the mouse does not work on wooden surfaces.

I would understand if the mouse doesn't work on glass surface but wooden surface?!?! This is really a bummer and I probably have to pay expensive shipping fees to get my refund which is totally not worth it. I have used Razer mouses since 2007 with more than 5 different mouses CopperHead, Diamondback, Lachesis, Taipan, Taipan (again), DeathAdder(this), but this will be my LAST razer mouse for sure. Razer's CEO may be a Singaporean but he disappoints me with such sub-par products and lousy aftersales support. I'm going Logitech or other brands from now on."
34,1,Never worked right
35,1,it says it is in good condition but lots of scratches does not even work never played it  don't buy
36,1,"If you like hackers and lag, this is a great game. I have owned it for the last 24 hours. I bought it direct from Origin. It took about an hour to download with my 12M connection. About average for modern games. Physics were better and drivability improved over the last ""Most Wanted"" offering. After getting through the tutorial levels I settled in for about 10 hours of non-stop play. Here are my observations. First, you play online exclusively. This is beyond the ""persistent authentication"" of Steam and Origin, you simply must have a good broadband connection with good ping or you won't be able to play. Next, any time another human player enters your bubble of activity, prepare for massive lag with the player warping all around you madly. If you are a cop, forget trying to wreck someone who is never consistently in your game reality. Behind you, beside, in front blinking all around unpredictably. This is absolutely unplayable. The very nastiest part of this game is hackers. Nothing like having a guy warping all around you madly zapping you with pursuit tech over and over. No cool down and no chance to escape while you are killed like a helpless baby. This game is obviously of BETA quality. I wanted it to be great but sadly... it sucks.
 This is very important. EA's Origin Great Game Guarantee? YES. They will refund your money within 24hrs of activation. EA support appears to be much improved over past experiences."
37,1,"The pedals seem well made, and are wide enough and far enough apart for me. The assembly doesn't slide on a hardwood floor, too.

They are not plug and play. You have to go to the Thrustmaster website and download a driver. The two killer items are: high breakout forces from the detent, and the pedals move the throttle, not the rudder. I'm sure, with a paid version of FSUIPC I could reprogram the functionality, but high detent breakout forces don't make that worthwhile.

I have an ancient set of CH Products rudder pedals. They are ugly, and slip on hardware floors, but the detent breakout force is much less than these pedal's, and more importantly, they move the airplane's rudder.

I'd send them back, but it's way past the end of the return period."
38,1,"Sorry all but I am about to step on a ton of Nintendo lovers with this brief review about the travesty known as Metroid Prime. If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.

Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.

All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.

To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????

Uggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving. So far my experience with the WII has been pretty bad. Should have just stuck with my PS3..."
39,1,"I was very excited for this game. Unfortunately it is not even close to what I had hoped it to be. I wanted more of Wii Sports. This game isn't even in the same category.

The controls are NOT intuitive. For some of the games the controls don't respond well. In particular the archery game was one where I had to shake the wiimote to get the target to be on (you are not supposed to have to shake it). Soccer was confusing. Skiing was o.k. It was VERY short. Beach Volleyball was so-so. Kart racing (of course) is not Mario Kart.

You cannot play with your Mii (which is REALLY a let down!)

My daughter did play a little when I finished. She remarked that most of the games were very boring. In fact that's a good way to put it. BORING! There is also NO real exercise value to this like you get with Wii Sports--this is one that is absolutely not designed to get you up and moving even a little bit. The only exercise you might get is a little bit of thumb workout. Disappointing.

Hopefully it will have some trade in value since its brand new. Otherwise I'm out $30 (I wrote this review so you won't be too!)"
40,1,"It was not a good remake and I'd rather play the original then the remake. Overall, I rate this game 1/5."
41,1,"Seems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me. It's one of those games where you get your butt kicked while you're learning, a sensation I've never treasured. How would you like if I sat you down to a board game you didn't know -- you ask, ""How is it played?"" and I respond, ""Uh, you'll more or less get the idea once I start attacking you!"" That's exactly how this game works. I hate losing while I'm learning.

Anyhow, here's some other things:

1. The way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol' hack-and-slash action. Really, though, the lion's share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles, moving blocks around, pulling levers, turning cranks, etc. Lord, if I haven't had an a**full of these! I solve enough g.d. conundrums every day at work: I don't need a video game testing my intelligence. I want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword! Is that too much to ask!?

2. The actual adventures your guy goes through get mind-numbingly repetitive, even if you're playing through the game for just the first time. Nearly every encounter is based on the ""cage match"" paradigm: your character trips some sort of switch, whereupon some sort of of walls come up, and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch, whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue. Yawn.

3. You cannot control the camera at all, as you can in many games of this type. This is a shame, since there are some good visuals along the way. This drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what you're looking at. Heck, even when it's not a question of a puzzle, the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements. As a result of this, the game has a very restricted, cramped feel, since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see (e.g., the ledges he's jumping from and to), but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art.

4. The ""easy mode"" really isn't . . . the monsters are easier to kill, but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges (i.e, the spike room, flying through the tunnels), they still manage to infuriate everybody.

5. The actual combat is exceedingly dull, although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game. (I frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done).  Although there are a plethora of combos available, nearly all monsters -- including all boss monsters -- can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again.

6. This game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading aren't good enough to tell where your character is (e.g., remember jumping behind Athena's bed?). Most of the time this is because the lighting source (and therefore the shadows) are illogical, so it's difficult to gauge distance and height. Consequently, success in the game's many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization, not skill. Also, the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle: sometimes, you can leap vast chasms; other times, you can barely hop over a puddle.

7. I hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again. Why doesn't this game let you skip them?

8. The storyline is preposterous. The Olympians are immortal! How can they be killed? And how can you kill people who are already in Hades? And does it make sense that Kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of Olympus when he even can't jump over an effin' puddle!? The gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug!

9. The weapons you get have some grandiose names (e.g., ""Bow of Apollo,"" ""Claws of Hades""), but they're quite ineffectual, even against garden-variety zombies. If you're fighting a run-of-the-mill skeleton and it takes like 50 hits to kill him, it's time for a new weapon. (I love how the much-vaunted ""Bow of Apollo"" has about as much oomph as a spitwad.)

10. Curse you, Yu Suzuki, or whoever invented QTEs (Quick Time Events). I hate them. (These are the times when it's basically a cut scene but you have to press the X button or the O button at the right time.) What is this, the fourth grade? Are we learning to identify shapes this week? Another problem with these is that you can't focus on the cool graphics at all, since you're waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes. QTEs need to be outlawed!

11. This game is far too violent for my taste!  It just got to the point where you didn't want to enter QTEs when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross. If this had been a movie, it probably would have received an X for violence.  I mean, you're graphically pulling folk's heads off and stuff  Couldn't they have at least included a ""BLOOD OFF"" option, like they did in Assassin's Creed II?

12.  Game is not kind to you if you haven't played the first two installments.  You'll be baffled as to what's going on until at least halfway through the game."
42,1,"The game didn't work on my Wii U, it kept saying an error has occurred, I had to take out the disc and unplug the Wii U and plug it back in, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!"
43,1,"Harvest Moon: A Tale of Two Towns was my first time playing a Harvest Moon game.  I am a longtime fan of the Animal Crossing series and I always wanted to try out Harvest Moon but never got around to it.  Unfortunately, my first experience with this series was not a pleasant one.  I initially enjoyed starting out in my town of choice (Bluebell), learning to cook, tend to livestock, catch critters, and plant crops. After several in-game days of play I was walking around the mountain and all of a sudden the game shut down for no apparent reason with only a message stating that ""an error occurred."" Since I bought the game used, I tried cleaning it off and starting up again.  It appeared to work for several more in-game days.  After a lot of in-game ""work"" a few hours later, it happened again. I'm walking around the mountain and ""an error occurred.""  Instead of trying to exchange the game right away, I looked online first. To my dismay, it turned out to be a critical design flaw with this game in general and not a problem with my cartridge.  As others have mentioned, you can only save the game by ending your in-game ""day"" and going to bed.  This means you could have just caught a rare critter, sold a lot of items and completed quests and all of a sudden you lose it all at random and go back to your last save.

I have also heard a lot about Natsume deleting customer comments off of their website instead of trying to fix the problem or issue refunds.  I for one am getting sick and tired of the recent industry standards of pumping out every untested piece of junk to meet a deadline rather than worrying about customer service or producing quality software.  This isn't the only game it is happening to - Borderlands 2 has been experiencing major data loss issues for months, and that continues to go unfixed even though they continue to sell new DLC for the game.  There is no excuse for this type of thing and yet it continues to happen.

Natsume has suggested that you try picking up all items before changing screens on the mountain, not playing the livestock petting game more than 5 times per in-game day, and shutting down the game in between every in-game day to reduce incidents of freezing. Ummmmm, NO.  That isn't a fix, that is a royal pain.  I shouldn't have to work around their design flaws.  This game is simply unplayable.

At the end of it all I returned Harvest Moon: A Tale of Two Towns and exchanged it towards Harvest Moon: A New Beginning (the newer one). I still want to give this series a try because I genuinely liked the game other than the freezing thing.  I am not going to review the gameplay of Tale of Two Towns in this review because I see no point in it.  The freezing flaw is unacceptable and it ruins the game for me.  Hopefully A New Beginning also provides a better and more reliable experience."
44,1,"I really tried to like this game. I thought I would give it a try because it was a the second in the series. Surely if it was popular enough to get a second game to come over to america then there must be something to it that must draw people in, right? Is it the odd concept for a game? Was it the fighting? The dating? I had to know what it was that drew people in, so I went out and bought the limited edition and tried it. After playing for 30 hours I can say that I have no idea. The dungeons are repetitive, the girls are very much the clich female types in a harem games and the main character is very much a Marty Stue. The kids were adorable, but I did not have much attachment to them because the main character cycled through them so fast and they had no characterization/backstory. The battle system was also very repetitive and I had no incentive to go to the next dungeon, I only did because the plot told me to. Grinding was unnecessary because the bosses never gave me much of a challenge, however if you wanted to get in good with the girls I found that it was almost necessary to enter the dungeons more than was needed. Forced grinding made me lose interest to stop playing it early even though I feel like I am near the end.
Dating was so easy; give the girl a gift and answer correctly (though, answering correctly did not matter that much because if you choose the wrong answer you could just come back, give a gift and make it all better) the multiple choice options. Which is typical for a dating-style game, but not entirely inventive and hardly the thing I would imagine to bring players to this game. It was scarily easy to woo even the most stubborn of the girls which made it hard to feel like I accomplished something by the end.
I understand it is an interesting concept, but the battle system, plot and character descriptions could have been written by a 5 year old. I would not have minded the fact that the girls were so fanservice-y if the game itself was even slightly interesting. I find I can't finish this game. After this many hours I feel like the plot should pick up and I should not feel like I am doing the same exact things as I was 20 hours ago. beautiful artwork and cutscenes; very bad game. I would have been okay if this was just a show rather than a game."
45,1,Awful game...
46,1,"I bought the Ghostbusters PC version.  Installed successfully and loaded properly.  However, after the initial cinematic scene and intro scene, the game freezes.  The freeze happens before you even get a chance to play.  Also, the game freeze is so bad that you have to reboot your whole computer.  Contacting the company, Atari, does no good; been waiting a week with no response.  Note: The computer that I use exceeds the minimum requirements to play.

The point: The game is probably good, but PC users are out of luck.  If you are using a PC to play games do not buy Ghostbusters."
47,1,"Still no Brazilian league, seriously????? Shame shame shame on EA! PES is all over it! Don't buy!!!"
48,1,"I guess I am spoiled  from skyrim and others by them
sucks for controls and storyline"
49,1,"Overhyped game. Love all Halo and Borderland games so came away disappointed. Should have listened to day 1 reviews from the other major critic review website showing 120 positives but 100 negatives. Bad sign. First I was fooled by the hype of Titanfall, then Diablo III, and now this.

Pros:
- Nice graphics, sound, and gameplay.
- Adventure/light RPG elements.

Cons:
- Just plain not fun and very boring. That goes for the main modes of the campaign which feels like all the missions are just the same.
- Same for vs multiplayer. Not much difference in playing the levels. No variety?... No large 8 vs 8, 12 vs 12, etc. No CTF. No TDM. No invade the base types.
- Lots and lots of rinse and repeat campaign missions or objecives leading to it being repetitive. Too much being the same. Same for multiplayer.
- Playing by yourself is a horrible and extremely boring experience. I played a couple campaign levels with some randoms and it was a little more fun. I play online w/ a dozen close friends and family but NONE of them wanted this game so playing vs multiplayer wasn't fun and was boring. Probably would have had more fun playing campaign w/ close friends and family.
- Nothing special or exciting when doing anything in the game from start to finish. Walking around the planets, talking to people in the city, picking up new equipment, getting new weapons, campaign missions, and vs multiplayer. Found myself going back to my laptop, tablet, phone, or just dozing off/falling asleep on my couch.
- Online only. I have a couple friends that love campaign games but didn't know it can't be played offline. Dumb.
- Kicked you out for being idle. Very annoying you can't pause the game. Sometimes I'm in the middle of a mission but like to do things like start laundry, take a long bathroom break, or fix something to snack on for a few minutes. I come back and I got kicked out to the main menu for being too idle. Dumb. I'm in the middle of mission to get up a few min now I have to start over.
- Peter Dinklage as the main commentator is horrible and sounds very boring. Love him as an actor. Stuck with hearing his non exciting voice in all modes."
50,1,"Edit: 10/6/2014 - I ended up returning this unit a week after I bought it.  It stopped reading my sega genesis controllers, and I refuse to use the infra-red ones that come packed-in.  I would file this under ""too good to be true."" Some units might work consistently (based on the reviews) but it seems to be VERY 50/50.  As a result, I'm changing my previous rating from 2 stars to 1.  Don't waste your time.

To break it down simply, let's start with pros and cons:
Pros:
1) Composite video output is crisp and clean
2) My Sega Genesis controllers work
3) My Genesis cartridges work
4) Packed-in genesis games play as good as their physical counterparts

Cons:
1) Infrared controllers
2) Sound is poor quality and wrong pitch

The cons greatly outweigh the pros, even though there are more ""pros"" than ""cons.""

The fact that they made these controllers infrared limits their usefulness - or more accurately, renders them useless - because IR requires a clear line of sight and is not exactly known for responsiveness.  IR works great for TV remotes because reflexive and repetitive button pressing is not required for watching TV.  They simply made the controllers IR to cut costs and say they have wireless controllers.  It would have been just as cheap (and more reliable) if they'd packed in wired controllers.  After reading the reviews, I didn't even bother with putting the batteries in...I simply know better.

The sound chip is tuned to the wrong frequency.  For those less technically inclined, it means that everything (music and sound effects) play at a lower pitch than normal, like a cassette walkman when the batteries are low.  It might play at the right tempo, but the pitch is distinctly lower.  For folks that used to own a Genesis, or played the Genesis collections that have come out over the past 10 years, this is very distracting.

That said, I put in my Ghouls & Ghosts cartridge and my Sega Genesis controller, and gave the system a system a legitimate go.  The lower-pitch music made the game more haunting and creepy, but some of the higher-pitched sound effects (or sounds that were SUPPOSED to be higher-pitch) were crackly as the poor sound chip tried to crunch them out.  The buttons were sometimes non-responsive, but that is likely because my controller is from 1990.

After playing a couple stages in Ghouls & Ghosts, I played Sonic & Knuckles on the system itself.  Navigating the menus was simple and straightforward. Each game had a brief description, instructions, and a screen shot of their respective games.  Given the general cheap quality of this system, I feel like some kind of effort did go into making it a reality.

I don't dislike the system, but I can't in good conscience recommend it. Paying $35 for wrong-sounding games, even with the packed-in games as a bonus, just isn't worth it when you can buy Sonic's Ultimate Sega Genesis Collection on PS3/360 for $10 and an old Sega Genesis off of ebay for $10.

This console would be perfect if they had:
A) Done quality testing to recognize the sound chip was wrong
B) Included 2.4 GHz wireless controllers or wired controllers.

I don't dislike it enough to return it, but I will say that the pricepoint doesn't warrant the sacrifices made on the manufacturer's part, and so I have to give this console a 2-star rating for the two ""cons"" of this console, and take a third star off for the cut corners."
51,1,"Simply put, this isn't Halo. This is Call of Duty using Halo's premise. Strategy is gone, all you do is run around with a DMR and kill people with 3 shots. The graphics looks like the just copy/pasted Bungie's work. Not much was created from scratch here, besides the horrible sound effects. I read through a majority of the reviews and I notice a trend. Pretty much everybody who likes CoD duty gives this game praise. Halo has lost what made it Halo.

Edit: I am getting some heat from fanboys so I'll list a few reasons here why the game sucks:

-killcam is either glitched, or the game's hitbox is completely wrong. The killcam shows your killer shooting at walls and clearly missing you during kills.

-vehicle animations seem unfinished. Watch a Wraith blow up... just wow.

-AI intelligence is at an all time low. Throughout the campaign I had the easist time running down enemies. They don't even move sometimes. The elites will jump into a banshee and then just fly into a wall, stuck there until you kill them. This is pathetic.

-343 messed with the spartan shields. Like I stated above, it only takes 3 hits to die from a DMR. Anybody trying to argue this doesn't know how to count. Aim for the heads, noobs.

-The servers are always screwed up. People's ranks, emblems, colors, and armors keep changing and reverting back to stuff they didn't pick. I don't think I've been in a game yet where a player wasn't saying WTF happened to my spartan.

I could go on and on, but I just don't care enough about this game to keep going. What an embarassing time to be a Halo fan. I can only hope 343 learns from their mistakes and does right with Halo 5. I'll be renting that one, not buying."
52,1,"I wanted to like this game.  I was into the story they where telling.  I liked the beta they had and the issues did not appear major.  Now i am finally reviewing this and sadly it is a 1 start for me and my oldest son.

The Bad:

The game has issues for us.  He has had enemies go into areas that he cannot get to and still was able to shoot him.  These are failed missions because you cannot take them all out.  I saw this in the beta way back and this was an issue for him only 2 days ago (from this review).

I have had sound issues where everything sounds muffled.  In these instances the frames can drop sometimes.  But the biggest issue is the guns do little to no damage at all.  Case in point:

-Today I was playing a mission.  I had already done a lot of side missions and was way ahead of the level requirement.  I also play on hard and have a fairly easy time with the single player content.  I get to a point where I am defending with a timer.  The sound messes up on the last enemy and no way to damage said enemy.  This leads to spawn after spawn at this point with no damage to enemies.  I finally exit the game and reload.  Starting at the beginning.

-After restarting the mission I am going along and I find that I pass the problem point easily (on hard) and get to the final boss of that mission.  At this point I get the odd sound problem and the guns do no damage.  Long mission and a little disheartening.  I die 4 times.  On the fifth spawn the game puts me on a screen where my character and the games level assets are greyed instead of full color.  My character is walking in place and is aiming to the side but has not weapon in hand.  I am playing single player but the game says ""Waiting for Revive"" on the screen.  No option at all but to exit the game.  I could not fast travel to a safe house.  I could not spawn again.  Nobody could join me to hopefully break me free to finish the mission

The above is just one major issue I have had.  Others:

-Enemies invisible.
-Enemies in walls or other inaccessible places
-Not able to pick up look <--Very bad because I have had drops of much better weapons and cannot pick them up with on 15 of 46 inventory full
-Weapon parts that show on map are not there.  They were there for my son but on my play some are just not showing.  Even though they are on the map
-My son has had connection issues as well with friends who he was playing with.  They just claim the game is slowly breaking completely.  But it is not an issue with out internet and does not effect any other games

In the end I think I am done with Ubisoft games for a while.  I definitely would not recommend this game."
53,1,"Overpowered mobs, underpowered you - that's this game in its entirety. It was made to be played in groups I guess, but the experience completely aggregates and is overly frustrating."
54,1,"This game came with Xbone bundle so I had to try it but no..just no.
The campain is predictable and bland, Kevin Spacey pixels are the best part. Your own char looks like retard. Aside from Spacey voice acting atrocious.
The gameplay: it's twitch reflex, AI stupid, you die fast so I put it on recruit after 4 missions to get it done fast.

The multiplayer: I was gobsmacked...I did find a respect for people that do this crap all day but I find no enjoyment in dying instantly. I have no idea how to quickscope or or jump shoot and have no option to learn. My highest score was 8-12 and only when running full speed spraying from hip...you die instantly,so what do class builds mean? I have no idea how this is popular. Presumably you need a 100mb down internet or something to twitch faster (I only have 8mb on classic adsl)
You absolutely need brain malfunction to play this all day."
55,1,"I have no idea what Ea was thinking.  I get that they wanted to make the sims smarter but this has ruined the rest of the game.  As a huge sims fan I couldn't have been more let down.  This looks like an upgraded Sims freeplay but a majorly downgraded sims 3.  It's a huge bummer.  I immediately returned mine since I purchased it through EA with the game guarantee.

Graphics actually got worse
Frustrating game controls

Maybe I'll consider re buying it after some expansion packs come out but after waiting so long for this base game I'm not sure."
56,1,"After playing through this game the past week and a half, I have to say I'm highly disappointed. This game is a mess. An absolute piece of garbage. How can a game that had been delayed a half a year turn out to be this unfinished, and why did they push up the release? I have a feeling they just wanted to get this lost cause out the door and recoup as much money as they could. It's obvious they didn't test this game at all outside their own offices.

The game has horrible texture pop in. Sometimes just leaving a room and coming back a second later and it still takes 4 or 5 seconds for the texture to load. The shooting, it just feels off. It's like the gun is unable to aim and hit a running target at all. You can get tko'd in 1 or 2 hits and have to wait to respawn up to 20 seconds. Another problem with this game is the respawns. They give you command posts to capture throughout the game, but yet you can't spawn on them? TSK TSK whoever came up with the bright idea for you to always spawn at the starting point of the level. Not only do you have to wait 20 seconds, but run another minute or so to the objective only to get killed again.

This game is very unbalanced. The attacking team almost has no chance on any objective. I sat back one game as defender online and our team literally mowed down the offensive team for 10 straight minutes. Getting an objective done while in offense online is practically a miracle. Most people don't even adjust their character to meet the class needed to complete the objective, so your mostly going it alone on a team of 7 other people. That's if you get a lag free game...

The lag. It's horrible. No excuse for this kind of lag. I've never experienced this in any game I've played. I'm talking slideshow at some points. It's not just me, but everyone is complaining about the lag. Still, Bethesda/Splash Damage have done nothing to fix it, but add matches with less people. Which means you get to play in games with 2 or 3 people facing off with 2 or 3 people. Real fun! Huge maps with just 2 people per team running around. I wish they would of just canned this game. It's not a game, but an open retail beta copy right now, and Splash Damage has not done one thing to fix it."
57,1,I gave it one star because I ordered the wrong power supply cord and had to send it back.
58,1,"I can't recommend this game for console. On PC it is hard to beat in its category (BF1 and Hardline didn't) but on console it has horrible servers, a sparse community, and laughable performance."
59,1,"First off, I was obsessed with Fallout 1 and 2, and Fallout 3 was just so good that the glitches from the original game just didn't effect me so much.  I was enjoying the original Fallout 3 game too much, but the down loadable contents(DLC) were too glitchy to try again.
Now with a new company making the new installment, I hoped that the quality of the game would be better.  NO IT DIDN'T.  It's basically Fallout 3 with additional glitches that are too much to enjoy.  What is worst is that the glitches are so bad that it CORRUPTS saves.  So forget about continuing your progress, since they won't mean anything.

If you still want to purchase the game, then DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME for this console.  The Xbox 360 has a timed exclusive like Fallout 3.  Also, once the DLCs were available for the PS3 users, the DLCs were filled with glitches that were NEVER PATCHED.

I REALLY HATE THE WAY BETHESDA SOFTWORKS AND their scapegoat, Obsidian Entertainment.  SERIOUSLY, THEY MUST THINK PATCHES ARE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE GAMES.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY FINISH THE GAME AND SEE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS IT AS A FINISH GAME.

(Review of the game)
It's just one giant DLC.  Almost every part of the game is the same as Fallout 3.  The only differences are just the small details.  New additional weapons, trees, Vegas.  There are some good parts of the game, but there are just too much of the last game in this game that it's really not a new game.

It's much more harder than the last Fallout 3 game.  They went back to the original leveling up sequence from Fallout 1 and 2 where you can only get a perk after leveling up a few times, instead of leveling up every time.  Now you can get two more companions at the same time.  One is a living person and the other is a machine or mechanical one. Also, for Fallout 2 fans, this game does mention the tribal descendant, vault dweller as well as his/her's super mutant companion.  Arefu remind you of anything.

I rented this damn game, and, based on my experience, didn't taking advantage of Black Friday deals where this game was marked down to $34.99.  The game is just so badly made that I didn't want to help top this game as a best-seller.  As a PS3 owner, this time exclusives are worthless.  If you decided to stick it to your PS3 consumers, you can guarantee that some us are more interested in other games than your DLCs when it comes out.

Bethesda Softworks is a bad game company and their treatment towards PS3 consumers are horrible.

When you buy Bethesda Softworks, you're buying an unfinished game period."
60,1,"I never even got to download the game, because this was a game code / key that was supposed to be used in EA's Origin software.  Origin wouldn't let me log in to my account, and none of the dozens of password reset requests I sent ever arrived.  I tried EA's customer support site and even selected the option for ""I can't get into my account"", and it asked me to log in to get help logging in to my account!! WTF!?  Basically, this is completely unplayable for me.  Thankfully Amazon support was very helpful, but they can't exactly provide software support for EA's broken products."
61,1,"...you're relying on it's preloaded cheat codes.  Gameshark has since shut down any support for this software disk. There's a ton of games you won't find codes for or any updated codes for previous games. Gameshark also removed all updates for preuploaded cheat codes so you can transfer them to your PS2 via flash pen drive. Unless you're a wiz at programming your own codes via computer and know how to transfer them to the memory card on disk boot up, don't bother with this crap. Gameshark is no longer Gameshark at it's core. It's been bought out and management is completely lacking. They now provide different and cheaper products that have nothing to do with cheats or codes. Look to other devices instead."

63,1,"Tried multiple times.  Downloaded another game, so it wasn't my system.  Got a refund from Amazon."
64,1,"The game was going along fine in the beginning, a bit confusing, but nothing that couldn't be solved with some patience. Then came Mission 5, ""The Hard Way"". Could not interact with the overseer. I pressed 'E' several dozen times and the game would just go to the Naval map. On occasion a message would come up on the Naval map asking if I would like to start the Mission. I'd click on ""confirm"" and it would just stay on the map. Click 'E' again and back to the overseer who I still could not interact with. Any suggestions would be appreciated. One comment by another reviewer is correct, this game was not designed for the PC."
65,1,"A ""free"" download that was little more than a demo for a game that costs easily $220.00 to fully experience, with clunky controls and an interface that was clearly never intended to be used on a computer."
66,1,"This is the worst port I've played in a long time. And I thought Mass Effect was bad. By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.

The controls are lousy. You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail. The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping. Miserable to play throughout.

The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s). I can't get decent frames no matter what. I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics. Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly. Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish. The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.

Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash. It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable. Don't buy under any circumstances."

73,1,the game is really boring not what I thought it would be its a overhyped shooter in my opinion just like the rest of the mainstream shooters
74,1,"This is what you get when you allow greed to run unchecked. And 2K GAMES is an insistent and repeat offender of such abhorable tactics.

This is not a game. It is DLC-pushing scheme that will not end before the complete game (which one should expect be getting after sliding over $60!) ends up costing between $350-400. And that too much for any game - let alone a game that brings no innovation in either gameplay or visuals and gets old too soon. Just head over at Metacritic and see for yourself.

Day-one DLCs? Check. (TWELVE of them - totaling $80-extra!)
Endless microtransactions? Check.
Severely limited content? Check.
Single-Player slapped on as an afterthought? Check.
Console-limited graphics? Check.
The ...success of BRINK revisited? You bet!

When someone made the mistake of paying $60 for a shell of a game, been asked to pay $15 for each extra monster and $10 for each extra character is not greed: it is information highway robbery!

A product to ignore. Even when the entire bundle will be available on STEAM Sale for less than $10, it will still be an overpriced boring game.

Bound for a quick Extinction."
75,1,"Read the other reviews about how you have only one chance to make use of slingshot...

My issue is the game crashes / locks up on me all the time since this purchase.

3 times now have lead/forced to a reboot.  What happens is - nothing works in terms of actions.  However, I can move the screen around as normal.  Just can't pick solider or action.
(CTRL ALT DEL - Task Manager - Just pops right back to game. - so you have to select reboot to end the problem)

- One of the original problems I had was the save gave feature - you don't realize you are not saving the game anymore (choosing default save)
and it carries over to this as well.  You have to be really careful to make sure you are saving when you are saving.

- I had accidentally deleted my games when I finished the original - so I have NO idea if you can go into slingshot with a well armed team (as my guys started out from the beginning)

And back to the locking up and crashing.  Just very frustrating to get a mission almost 90% done and have to reboot the PC.

UPDATE about 3 days of playing game:  This time I am taking my time and not researching the PRIORITY items as soon as they show up (I think this acts as a trigger to move to the next level)

So I have been getting everything I can get done before moving on to the priority items.  What I have noticed is I am playing A LOT of the original game.  Very little is different at this point.  I had a couple of slightshot missions early on - like 2 and now 10+ missions have been the regular stuff I already beat.  Perhaps after those key PRIORITY trigger points more will appear and HOPEFULLY the ending is different but for right now, I am just playing the game I bought before - NOT the DLC."
76,1,"Went and bought this for Xmas. Worked fine, then the next week, ""Disc Read Error""? WTH?!!. Even though I read about this from other owners, I decided to take a chance. Never again. People poke fun at the older sytems, but my Playstation 1 has never, ever failed me, and I almost traded it in for this crap. My other older systems, such as the SNES, Genesis and N64 have performed well without any problems. I took this back and will stick with the ol' skool systems. But then again, I guess I'm not a ""real"" gamer until I own an XBOX or PS2, right? As for the reviewer who told the guy to get a brain because he said playstation 1 was better, why don't YOU get a life. People have their own preferences in what they like."
77,1,"The case is nice, I feel like my 3DS is protected. However, for some reason I find pushing the L & R buttons more difficult now. The buttons seem somehow out of place. When I try to push the L & R buttons in I am actually pushing a little below them which has caused me to mess up on the game I am playing (my daughter noticed the same problem when she was using my 3DS with the new case).

The hinge on my 3DS has always felt a little loose and I liked the fact that this case helps to support it and it actually makes the hinge feel tighter.

My daughter picked up my 3DS and said ""wow cool case but it sure adds weight to it"". I did notice the weight difference, not major but enough to bother me.

The case is very easy to put on and if you follow directions, fairly easy to take off.  All in all it is really nice looking - goes great with the aqua blue 3DS, seems like it will offer fair protection..... but takes a little getting used to.

update:  While I still like what this case looks like, it does not do anything to protect your 3ds... I knocked my 3ds off my night stand it hit the side of the night stand and fell about 3 feet and hit the floor... and died. It no longer works at all :(  I would think that it could handle a 3 foot fall onto carpeting but it couldn't."
78,1,i should of done research on this game before I had bought it. It's a battle game between you and another opponent like in mortal combat. This game sucks straight up and there's nothing special about it.
79,1,"Gamecube:
Best Game-  Star Wars Rogue Leader
Best Feature- Game Boy Advance Capibility
Graphics Rating- 4 stars
Xbox:
Best Game- Halo
Best Feature- Dvd Playback
Graphics Rating- 5
I admit that Star Wars Rogue Leader is a very good game but the rest of the games on gamecube you can get on another console or the games stink.
Some people don't have Game Boy Advance (i do) but having a feature that all people cant have is not a very good best feature.
Graphics for the gamecube I think are not that special, the graphics even look somewhat similiar to the first playstation.
Halo is a very good game most people should enjoy it even if they don't like first person shooters.
The best feature for the xbox is dvd Playback some people may not like a video game system having a dvd because they think a video game system should be for video games only, well i still don't understand why that should keep them from buying the xbox if you don't like the fact that dvd Playback is the best feature for xbox than you don't have to use it.
Oddworld Munchs Oddysey is the game that has the worst graphics for xbox  but still the graphics are better than some of the gamecube games.
I hope this review helped you decide between xbox and gamecube."
80,1,"As a story-teller I was eager to play this game for the wide possinilities of scenarios.  As a game I was very disappointed.  First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions.  Only in game play was I able to move my character.  Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt.  If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo.  That was just a waste of space.  I also felt limited by the small selection of tools.  Not even the cheat codes would entirely work.  For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips.  The guns themselves were not even very good.  The sniper rifle didn't ""snipe."" The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak.  I should have bought Halo when I had the chance."

If you're thinking about wasting $65 on this game, do yourself a favor and don't.  Buy it used, if you have to buy it at all, so that EA gets the message that they can't continue to mess with their consumers, year after year after year.

Oh, and one other thing -- some of the guys who gave the game 5 starts, like Ryno, are actually EA Game Changers, meaning, they're paid by EA to come on here and give falsely inflated review scores."
83,1,Not sure how many people are aware but Ubisoft deliberately limited the PS4 version of this game to make the graphics on par with the weaker X box One. They have even admitted numerous times. So PlayStation owners are getting a weaker version of this game. Send a message to Ubisoft that we want the best graphics possible not pathetic limitations.

An accurate description of this game would be civilization for dummies.  This is like a shell of what it used to be.  This game is not worth your money or your time.  And the fact that one must be connected to the internet to play through steam each and every time, sucks, and is a slap in the face to everyone who spends their hard earned money on this software.

In summary, do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage.  The gameplay and mechanics stinks, it is very buggy, and the steam DRM kills it."
89,1,"First of all, the only consoles that i have ever owned are a nintendo gamecube and the ps3. When i first saw the ps3 i knew i wanted it, but at the time i didn't have enough money to get it. I didn't want an xbox because i hate the design of the controller and the rrd issues. and i thought a wii was probably to kiddish for me. At anypoint, for the 2 yrs that i had it i loved it, but it broke on me earlier this year. YLOD issue.  which is a huge problem from some of the blogs online. i read that quite a few people are having problems with this issue in the older models. what i don't understand is why sony only warranted there product for 1 year. im guesing that they knew there were some flaws in quite a few of them. im very dissapointed with that. Luckily though, i did get an added warranty with my product since it did cost me 500 at the time (bought it from walmart). needless to say, walmart warranty plans suck. i sent it in 3 times because of ylod issue and it came back twice with other problems. still waiting on refund or another ps3. If you ever do decide to get one. make sure you have an extra warranty and don't buy from walmart because there warranty service is a joke."

From the recycled enemies with new idiotic powers to the terrible jump puzzle raid, don't waste your money on this ripoff."
91,1,The game is sold as a sexy game but when actually played it turns around and literally preaches to you. The disturbing use of sheep I believe is supposed to be symbolic of lost sheep suffering in hell.  The end ok each level after cube building you way out of hell at the top is a church and you have to go in the confessional to end the level. The game play is your character playing a boring repetitive cube puzzle game were each level is the same only you have to go faster. And there is no playoff for all the sexual teasing the game try's to pull you in with at the beginning. It a complete fail in every way boring game play. Preachy bait and switch advertising and a complete waste of money.

95,1,"It is always sad when a great historic game franchise comes to the end of its road. But it is depressingly sad to watch it do so in this condition.

KANE IN DISNEYLAND?
The graphics are laughable. True, EA has been steering the C&C franchise towards the ...cartoon direction ever since the RED ALERT 3 installment. But the RED ALERT series had always been more playful. Even so, what was barely palatable for a RED ALERT game is outright insulting for a TIBERIUM one.
If his tanks could still run-over infantry units, have no doubt, he would hunt down whoever did this to him.
Because, you cannot mock Kane and avoid having your lungs infused with Tiberium fumes!

MORE UNITS? PLEASE WAIT BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. FOREVER.
One of the most annoying features of the new C&C4 is the units cap. You cannot produce more units above a (very low) number. Upgrading your tech-tree with such a unit cap in place means you have to kill and replace most of your units - and make painful decisions as some units are more equal than others. It feels like having to deal with a (small) Diablo-like inventory: whatever does not fit within the grid must be left behind to rot.
And to add insult to injury, extra units are bestowed with a dropper. A tiny one.
This cap reeks of one thing: an attempt to turn this series into a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (fewer units means less lag). And no one seems to care that this took away one of the most fun tactics in a C&C game: tank rushing.

SORRY, ALL OF OUR TIBERIUM-HARVESTERS HAVE BEEN RECALLED. WOULD YOU CARE FOR A SENSIBLE COMPACT?
A COMMAND & CONQUER game without harvesting? It could be an RTS game of any name (and there have been baseless RTS games before), why did it have to be a C&C game? Because, once again, EA proves to have no respect for this beautiful art-form. If it means exploiting a classic title in its swan song to sell a few more units, so be it.
Moreover, game publishers seem to have an ever declining expectation of their targeted customer IQ. Hence the ever simplified games released. So, yes, this feels like C&C-for-Dummies.

BATTLEFIELD CONTROLS OFFLINE? YOU'RE SCREWED COMMANDER!
Yes, this must be the most inconvenient DRM scheme ever.
If you hate STEAM for requiring endless updates, this is worse.
If you hate games that require online activation because they never actually become yours, yes, this is worse.
And if you hate games that come with Limited Activations and become worthless the moment you pop the box, well yes, this is worse.
This inconceivable scheme demands for the owner of this game to always be online to verify that the copy he payed for is legitimate. That's right, not just activation, ALWAYS ONLINE. Yes, even for a single player game.
Will it deter piracy? No, pirates will be playing the game without all those DRM hassles. Legitimate gamers are left complaining - and, once more, EA will turn a deaf ear.

All in all, C&C4 will not appeal neither to old friends of the series nor younger gamers. And (for as long as it will keep working), it will have you jumping through hoops for the privilege of having ...bought it. And I thought it was the other way around.

This Tiberium field has been depleted long ago.
Move along Commanders."

99,1,"SecuROM - a sure, instant way of providing death to PC gaming as we know it.  Sure, game companies would like to provide protection against software pirates, but let's make a couple of things clear:

1.  Sorry, Ubi.  If you think that pirates are not going to think their way around this one, think again.
2.  SecuROM interferes with my burner.  I do a LOT of home video creation with Sony Vegas Pro ($500+ software).  Do you think that I'm going to WANT to install a $49 software package that's going to ruin that, not to mention the hell-on-earth experience of REMOVING this piece of junk?  Even if it were in the discount bin at $9.95, I would never even dream of creating an afternoon of fun trying to fix my hardware again.

I am very sad to say that I will not be purchasing Far Cry 2.  I was soooo looking forward to this game, but SecuROM is an instant turn-off.  I don't pirate games, so for some person to wreck my hardware set-up with inept software because they don't trust ME doesn't earn my business.

Mark my words - if the PC gaming industry continues on this path, it will spell a slow but sure death to PC gaming as we know it.  There must be an easier way - and SecuROM isn't it.  Perhaps they should call it SecuROT?

I am going to enjoy my original, legal purchase of Far Cry now."
100,1,"Please hear me out. Let me try to explain why I gave this system such a low rating.

Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting, I would be giving it 3 stars. But, unfortunately, there really isn't anything very interesting about this console. The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.

I'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.

Finally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.

For the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices. If it hadn't been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me, this would have a higher rating.

Take off the rose tinted glasses people."
101,1,Cool concept but ultimately feels uninspired and contains a combat system that just doesn't feel right.  Difficulty goes from balanced and enjoyable to over the top and downright punishing as soon as you fight a boss.

The music is outstanding I just would not have spent any money on this and Im sure MJ the perfectionist he was would not either.

108,1,"I loved the original starcraft and was totally addicated to it. Starcraft 2 is just as fun with better graphics... if you are willing to go through the massive hassle to ""install"" the game.

However, my rating is for the ridiculous DOWNLOADING REQUIRED to play the game. Is Blizzard forcing people to DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE game all over again, despite the contents on the disc?! This single 8GB Dual Layer Disc that you get in the box is essentially USELESS.

One would think when you're buying a PHYSICAL DISC, you could start playing the game right away - saving bandwidth/time to install the game; as opposed to buying a DIGITAL CONTENT where you have to download the whole thing.

Blizzard now REQUIRES you to DOWNLOAD an entire whopping 15 GB file to start playing the game.

I played Starcraft 2 when it first came out, but years later today, I decided I wanted to play it again and reinstall the game on a new computer...

I can not believe the installation/update is going to take FOREVER having to download this ridiculous 15 GB file/practically the ENTIRE GAME. What is the point of having the DISC now? It is worthless.

No wonder the game is so cheap now... you are basically buying a CD-KEY and an INSTALLER software without the actual game contents.

Seriously, what is this mess/deal Blizzard is trying to pull? The Update Patch is an enormous 15 GB! (imitates Doc Brown 15 jiggawatts!!!! I mean, 15 gigabytes!!!!!) If I was on 4G network with unlimited bandwidth, I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem, but come on now... Definitely won't be buying any Blizzard games; I don't care if they're selling for a $1.

Having to download DOUBLE the amount of the worthless 8GB Dual Layer Disc, where it's essentially just a download launcher, is absolutely ridiculous bait & switch tactic Blizzard is trying to pull here."
109,1,"- total garbage
- had to return the first pair after a few months
- had to return the second pair after another few months but decided to go with another brand
- constant screech of a 1991 impact printer outbound to all people on the other end
- inbound audio constantly failed
- no 5.1 surround sound...........total lie
- not digital for PC unless you buy a TOSLINK cable for audio, but then you can't use the microphone, unless you get yet another 3.5mm audio cable to PC, and buy yet ANOTHER male 2.5mm male-to-3.5mm female to connect the headset to the PC, WHICH ISN'T EVEN WIRELESS AT THAT POINT! And even then IT'S NOT 5.1 SURROUND SOUND AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNND THE VoIP QUALITY STILL SCREECHES!

This product was just a total pile of overpriced garbage. After I finally cut my losses with the endless troubleshooting and purchases of extra parts I decided to go with another brand, and researched everything. I found other headsets that were way, way better and of much higher quality but were far less expensive. Do you know why? It's because with this unit YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE WIRELESS CAPABILITY! This unit was easily marked up at least a hundred dollars, simply for the fact that it's wireless. Other than that there is NOTHING good about it. I constantly had problems with it (both of them) and wasted so much money returning the first one and buying extra parts for the second one. Don't buy this. It's absolute crap! I ended up buying a pair of Turtle Beach Ear Force DP11 Dolby Surround Sound Gaming Headset and guess what! It's actually 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound! AND I DON'T NEED TO BUY EXTRA PARTS! The sound is amazing and the microphone isn't super fragile and ready to break internally LIKE BOTH OF THE RAZER HEADSETS I BOUGHT! Oh and I paid $140 less for the Turtle Beach one! I will never buy another Razer product again..."

111,1,"It's very sad how low blizzard's incalculable level of greed has taken them. This game is a total disappointment, disappointing graphics, disappointing gameplay, disappointing everything. The biggest no no here is how they're making an essentially single player game require an internet connection, and constant access to their servers in order to play it.

This basically means you do not own this game, if years down the road this company goes bankrupt, you will not play this game again, if you have connection issues, you will not play this game, if you are a soldier without internet access, you will not play this game.

Do not support blizzard and their unwarranted greed, buy torchlight 2 instead."

117,1,"I bought this game thinking I could play it - after all, I have a laptop beefy enough to handle most anything I throw at it. To my surprise and utter dismay, this game is literally a BRICK (actually less useful than a brick) unless you have a good internet connection.

A few things about this... for one, my internet connection (at home and otherwise) is often poor and intermittent (I live in the USA)... furthermore, many times I simply have no access such as when I travel for work (airport, airplane, etc)... so already the game's usability is shot. On top of all this - I simply don't want a cloud-only based game. I want my save files and I want my backup of my save files... Had I known what EA did to SimCity, I would not have bought this in the first place.

I was really looking forward to countless hours in this release of SimCity... very sad."
118,1,"i decided to try this game cause i have not played it in a long time, when playing the game on normal difficulty your timing has to be exact, maybe a little bit early. i cannot make it past the second level without failing on normal difficulty despite how accurate i was. now when you save your game, the menu is sensitive, you need to press the up down left right very quickly or it gets pressed more than once same problem with typing a letter

the game does have an easy mode which does solve the timing issue and make the game a bit more fun, but easy mode only plays the first 3 levels and it does not save, once you beat the 3rd level on easy mode it goes back to the title screen.

also the saved games glitch up, for some reason i cannot access the 2nd level when i got up to it on normal mode."
119,1,"There is some important storyline you need to see but this game is crap other than that. Imagine kingdom hearts with a different totally random slot battle. That is how stupid this game is.

If the creators of these final fantasy games want better sales, make the Final Fantasy VII remake we have wanted for so long. The fans deserve BETTER."
120,1,"I honestly can't judge the function of this divice as the cable is long enough to reach from the top of my TV down to the PS4 in my entertainment system, I don't think I have an abnormal setup 60"" TV on a media stand with the PS4 in teh stand.  Untill they make an extension cable I would have to warn anyone with anything bigger the 40"" or a particularly complicated set up (this icludes any from of wire management) to stay away."
121,1,all the Disc's wasn't there
122,1,"its like they took what made COD bad and added Bigger Robots. please for the love of all things gaming DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT to download or buy or play or even demo this game for free, it is the WORST. i downloaded it this weekend because it was free and it took me 20 minutes to realize that was a mistake lol. i didn't think ANYTHING could be worse than COD Infinite Warfares multiplayer but i was so wrong its not even funny. download HAWKEN instead, much better game than this and its FREE on Xbox Live."
123,1,your playing a game you think its fun from the case you put it in and everything goes to hell
124,1,"I try to be very forgiving when I review a game. I know how complicated and stressful the terms are for the designers/programmers.

This game just cannot be excused.

Here are the major problems with this game -

1- The graphics are fair, but chunky, stiff and dated.

2- Gameplay is completely SCRIPTED.

3- Gameplay is clumsy and awkward.

4- Weapons are terribly inaccurate, even from 5 feet away!

5- User Interface is frustrating, switching weapons is too difficult.

6- Story line and voice-acting are pretty lame.

The graphics are not impressive at all, the jungle environment is linited to the paths and directions the designers want you to take...this means you always walk into traps!

You must progress through to your objective, if you don't, the enemies don't stop coming...they are constantly spawned over and over and you'll die! So even though the game teaches you to hide behind cover...you can't because your forced to charge the enemies to make them stop getting spawned...YIKES!

The weapons are terrible. I can stand 5 feet away from an enemy with an M16 or AK-47 and completely miss my target with short bursts to control recoil! Talk about driving you insane!

Then when your in the heat of battle you cannot switch quickly to another wepaon, the guy has to slooooowly holster/shoulder his weapon, then take out the other weapon. By then, your dead!

On top of all of that...you have to play in 3RD person!!!!!!!!!!

About 10 minutes of playing wil have your stomach churning from nauseau and dizziness.

This game could have been lemonade....I guess the development team was too lazy to squeeze so we are left sucking lemons!

SAVE your $$$...buy Call of Duty, Call of Duty:United Offensive...Medal of Honor, Battlefield Vietnam, Star Wars Battlefront....anything is a better choice!

Don't believe me?

Download and try the demo out. Do a Google search for ""ShellShock: Nam '67 reviews"" and see the low scores it gets! Judge for yourself but don't shell out your money right away based on the box cover!"
125,1,"Black Ops 1 vs Black Ops 2.  First game had great 'feel' to the gameplay.  Black Ops 2 felt like a cheap SEGA arcade port to PC.  That's what Titanfall 2 feels like.  Lot's of bouncing and hopping around.  Titans have lost all of their charm, and feel like cheaper, easier to play versions of their once mighty selves.  Everything just feels weak and shallow in comparison to the first version.  Easier to play for the XBOX crowd, but lame for real fps gamers.  I will give it a go for a few days, but looking like I will spend $60 to switch over to COD...

Revised review.

Single Player: Compelling but seriously short campaign.

Multiplayer:  Aimbot/Wall hacked on the day of release.  Not even worth logging in to the server it is so bad,  Pre-fire is rampant.  I bought two extra copies as gifts for my brothers, and am spending days apologizing for how bad the game play is.  Felt so bad I went out and purchased the new COD in it's place.  Until RESPAWN can get a hold of the hacking problem, I won't buy anther product from them."
126,1,Lots of problems getting the game to work half way through. Could not finish.
127,1,I bought this expecting a door for my PSP 3000. It looks like it's the right door but it is not wide enough to fit on the back. Very unhappy.
128,1,"I bought this used so that I could introduce my son to gaming on the original XBox.. But the controller stopped being recognized by the system shortly after purchase. It worked for about 4 hours before it started intermittently disconnecting and eventually no longer being recognized by the console. The other controller works just fine in all ports, so the system is not the problem. It is unfortunate, but I'll learn from my mistake and buy new next time."
129,1,"Dont buy this product if you live in central America because there is no way to get playstation plus or redeem codes , you need this to enter online game and functions"
130,1,"I purchased this game based on the reviews that stated they had no problem running this game without the CD. However, on my Win7 64-bit system, it refuses to play without the CD, instead popping up a SecuROM error message. Nowhere in the product description or on the case itself does it say anything about having SecuROM included, which is deceptive.

I don't know why others have not had an issue, unless the version I received is a different or ""updated"" one where SecuROM has been included. However, I will be returning it as I refuse to own any game that installs SecuROM.

So for those of you who want to avoid this DRM mess and play the game without the CD sitting in the tray, look elsewhere. You also have the option of simply buying this and taking a chance you'll get one like some of the other reviewers, which apparently does not have it installed.

Note: This is a newly purchased computer and Scrabble was the first game installed, so no, it's not another game that installed SecuROM, in case there was any question about that."
131,1,"Little Big Planet games are not for kids (as well as most adults). My kids (9 and 5) play Mario games without a problem but can only get passed the first dozen levels in this game. The difficulty gets ridiculous after the first few levels. As a big gamer myself, I find most levels to be TOO challenging. I think the main issue though is the ""controls"". This is not a Mario game...the character movements and controls are terrible so imagine what can happen during a difficult parts of a level. After you lose all of your lives (which are very few), you have to retry all the way from the beginning. UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great graphics and a lot of potential wasted with difficult levels and clunky controls....almost the worst controls in gaming history, in my opinion!"
132,1,"I have the steam version of this game, is a pain try to play it.
When I select keyboard to remap the keys, the game crash.
The key I for inventory doesn't work.
Also the game crash after some minutes of start playing it.
Developers should test more their products before make the releases.
A complete waste of money."
133,1,Boss battles are impossible.
134,1,OK LET START WITH THE GRAPHICS COMMON DEAD OR ALIVE 4 HAVE MUCH BETTER GRAPHICS AND IS A GAME FROM 2005 WE ARE IN 2009 I WAS ESPECTING MUCH MORE. THE ONLINE YOU ARE PLAYING AND YOU ARE DOING GREAT AND THEN PUFF DISCONECTED AND I HAVE 1.5 CABLE CONECTION. IF YOU PLAY THE GAME NORMALY SOLO WITHOUT ONLINE IS KIND OF GOOD GAME BUT TOO EASY. NEXT TIME I HOPE THEY MAKE BETTER GRAPHICS SOULCALIBUR 4 HAVE BETTER GRAPHICS SO COMMON CAPCOM.
135,1,"I bought two of these a few months ago, both have stopped working.  Poorly made, lousy response, just a really bad game controller.  Stay away from this junk.  There is a reason it's so cheaply priced."
136,1,"After Bioware's showings on Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age 2, it was quite clear that the EA board room was going to have more control over their games than their development team. Thus you end up with a rushed product. I'm sure the Mass Effect team did their best to reconcile what they felt needed to be done with the demands set upon them. It is not their efforts I critique, but their inability to fight for their own work. You can have a worthy conclusion to the saga or a two year development period, not both. So they saved some money on a short development and they loose a third of their fan base. I urge everyone not to buy this or at the very least wait until it's a value title. I will be selling my copy in order to take another $60 from Bioware/EA. I will not buy any DLC from them ever again and I will never purchase another game from them. What they don't understand is how quickly fans can walk away from them. I urge to do just that. I hope releasing another half baked game was worth it."
137,1,"This is one of the most frustrating games my family has encountered in a long time. When you can actually get on a server and play, it's loads of fun BUT you must spend literally hours sometimes getting times out waiting for a match or getting kicked from the server almost immediately. Seriously - hours. Even worse, when you finally are able to enter a match, often you make it almost all the way to the end and get kicked just before. This is unbelievably frustrating as you cannot level up without completing matches. The older teen boys in my house just gave up after a couple of hours. I tried longer, as did an adult son but we all come to the same consensus - this game is not ready for release.

It's too bad because the game looks so promising. The intro cut scene is just gorgeous and while the story line isn't especially strong or fresh, the multiplayer modes are great - when you can actually play. This is a hand to hand combat game and the character customization options are extensive after playing for a while.

Because I got this through the Amazon Vine program, I will keep trying weekly and will update if the server issues are remedied. Until then, I can't recommend anyone buying it."
138,1,"Bought 2 months ago, and mouse wheel already breaks. Great quality mouse. Would purchase again. 10/10."
139,1,"I won't bother to review this controller based on its features or capabilities, that's already been done.

Fundamentally, this controller doesn't work. The left analog stick will randomly ""stick"" or fail while playing games. The physical stick works great, but the game will react as if you are holding the stick in one direction when you have actually released it, or moved it in a different direction.
It does this intermittently and at random, and when it goes cock-eyed it may last for seconds or minutes. This made playing some games like Bioshock Infinite a bit of a challenge but not undoable. However a dual-stick shooter is impossible to play, unless your idea of playing a game is to play it like a retarded 4 year old.

I've updated the drivers (which are 3 years old), replaced batteries and re-calibrated it. Logitech support is, as usual, useless. You can search and find thousands of people reporting this problem and others.

This is a highly rated controller on Amazon for two reasons:
1) Cheap people who are more excited about the money they saved
2) Shills for Logitech"
140,1,My husband I started playing the game on launch day it was fun at first but slowly lost its appeal. Sadly to say we ended going back to WOW for some reason I have had more fun with that than I did with SWTOR. There has been a lot of hype for the game and sad to say bioware/EA has ruined this game. And they will continue to do so from what I have read. Many issues not fixed during beta and I have to say the game should still be in beta. It will be ten dollars at some point or go f2p in a about year or 2 from now. To me there isn't enough to do in the game. Battle grounds suck its the same rinse and repeat. Not enough characters or classes as well. So I have to agree with many on here the game is awful. And a waste of sixty bucks I will play WOW and wait for GW2 I don't think I will go back to SWTOR after my account closes might not even check it out if it goes to f2p not impressed at all and in fact kind of mad at myself for letting my husband buy the games in the first place I guess you have to live and learn so in a nutshell I don't recomend the game to anyone. Unless you are a starwars fan and this is your thing great if not don't bother play something else the game is not worth it
141,1,"I found this game to be very boring and extremely one sided in so far as you had virtually no way to defend yourself.  The fighting mechanics were awful, just awful.  I play games to have fun, not torture myself with uninspiring characters and clunky controls.  I wanted to like this game, but after 7 chapters I had enough."
142,1,"Ripped off. Shame on Amazon. I thought I was buying a new Game. When I tried to activate it the code came up as ""already used"" .. so I got nothing for my purchase. Checked around and it seems to be a common problem for this game bought on amazon"
143,1,"Decided not to pick up my preorder after trying the demo. No thanks, this game is perfectly set up to allow better players to camp out and do nothing but pick off new players to rank up. No fun & no thanks!"
144,1,This game is a waste! No single player campaign and its boring as hell!! I regret even renting it! Go buy Medal Of Honor Airborne instead!! That game is a million times better!!
145,1,"The first fishy thing I had with this product is that it came within a ziploc bag, not the usual hard plastic the Microsoft Batteries come in.  I even thought that it was a battery ripoff, but it actually had the MS hologram, so could well be an already used battery.  No problem so far as long as it worked, which did well for two months, and yesterday it just stopped charging.  They may be a used lot, refurbished, or plain and simple and old and dry useless lot.  I've read many complaints about them, but thought that it could be some that come bad, but it results that most, if not all, are bad.  I really do no recommend buying this."
146,1,"God i hate it when companies take things like controlpads and try to make them look aesthetically pleasing to home-decor over gameplay.

it must have been a woman that designed this pad.

i can't play without colored buttons. it makes it take far too long for me to figure out what to push.  color & shapes makes our brains grasp layouts quickly when it counts in a game.
i also hate the lack of different colors of the Wii controller.  controllers need to be all as colorful as the Gamecube pad.

i can't review it based on anything else becuase after i saw this i threw it back to the fishes."
147,1,I bought this a week ago and was happily playing until a steam update crashed it.  Now it doesn't work at all.  The problem is not with the game itself but with the evil steam wrapper.  Steam's support is entirely email based and they apparently can't be bothered to help.  They also don't allow refunds so they have very effectively stolen my money without providing a useable product.
148,1,"BORING LONG LAME PLOT
LAME CHARACTERS
LAME BORING DRAMA
LAME BORING SCARE MYSTERY
THE MONSTER DOESNT SHOW UP TILL VERY LATE IN THE GAME"
149,1,This game is pretty difficult in terms of fighting but that wasn't that big of an issue. There aren't any save points. That is why I'm getting rid of it. I don't spend hours playing a game to just get killed and start all over from the start and lose everything that you have accomplished. Guess what? When you have to fight these guys all over again you don't get anything after defeating them so your health supply is constantly dwindling down.  People are saying that it can be frustrating at first but you will get used to it. Not a chance. I don't have the patience to repeat things over and over. Into the archive of bad games it goes!
150,1,Piece of crap!!  Didn't work right out of the package!!
151,1,"Might be the worst game I've played in the past 2-3 years, which is maddening considering how many aspects they get right.

1. Visually it's a fantastic game.  The rubble that is Manhattan is well done with a solid feeling of grit and mud.  Playing at 4K/Ultra on a gtx 1070 is quite nice.  The day/night cycles are well timed.  Madison Square Garden is fantastic.
2.  The whole idea of the ""dark zone"" where human-on-human killing is allowed, but results in a bounty on your head...that's a very clever way of merging single player and multiplayer together.  The first few times I strayed into the dark zone, I was nervous as hell and moved slow and cautiously to avoid detection from the AI or any possible human players.
3.  The inventory system is well done with lots of various clothing, tools, accessories, and of course, weapons.

The part that just royally screws everything up is the gameplay mechanics.  There's a ""cover"" system where you press space bar to grab cover behind a wall or desk or whatever.  Where you'll want to throw this game out the window is when your cover no longer serves it's purpose and you try desperately to 'detach' from cover and cannot do so.  I've died about 500 times too many because I couldn't separate from a wall when an enemy flanked me.  It's not the worst idea, it's just botched like nobody has ever botched anything before.

I should have known that a game that's less than 50% of it's MSRP only a few months after launch will certainly have serious problems.  It's just unplayable.  All that glorious goodness that they got right...it's all wasted because I just can't move around the world and engage in combat in an effective manner.  I am constantly fighting the interface.  No thanks. Uninstalled after a week."
152,1,Got for free and I feel like that was a rip of. If you are paying for it I would pass.
153,1,"Originally gave this a 4/5, bumping that down to 2/5. After barely a year of actual use(when I got this there was a 6 month period of very casual to 0 use before it could actually be used for gaming) the left mouse button has snapped off. I'm not rough on my electronics by any means, so to have a mouse snap after only a year of real use is incredibly frustrating, especially for something I spent $60. I will not be purchasing a Razer product again."
154,1,"I brought this game for my wife. She is not a big gamer but she plays a lot of sims on the computer, she played this game for a few hours and never played it again her words was ""this game sucks""."
155,1,"First of all, i have gotten all achievements except for the 100% complete.  There is a review out there that explains the frustration with the flying controls and sometimes the camera (the view displayed to the gamer while playing) is just awful.  I love most if not all of the Lego series.  The glitches in this game are almost unbearable.

1. Characters sometimes get stuck in places that require a restart of the level.
 - This is highly frustrating and can really take the wind out of the players sails.
2. Game freezes and locks up at what seems like regular intervals.
 - In this day and age of games designed specifically for a console, glitches and bugs of this nature are completely inexcusable.  This just should not happen.  As of this posting, there have been no patches or discussion of patches.  This was a game that i looked forward to since the summer.  Traverler's Tales punched us in the gut with this one.
3. Some puzzles are just way to frustrating.
- There are a few instances where you might just choose to ignore a few side missions.  Poor design and ""wash, rinse, and repeat"" missions eventually feel like a punch in the gut.

Younger kids will like this game, but parents beware, it's always tough to explain to a young one why their game just froze up.  Although, these days, kids probably already know why.

Liked it, but the shortcomings are too great for anything greater than a one.  If TT can patch the game, this would be a 4.  (not sure you can patch the very bad flying mechanics, and flying is a bigger part of the game than you realize.)"
156,1,"My system says it's installed, but doesn't load the dlc in my game. Tried both amazon and Microsoft customer services to solve the issue, but they couldn't solve why. Had to call square Enix, but they were no help as well. Wasted $20."
157,1,Great sculpt... but not enough functionality in Nintendo games across all systems.
158,1,"I bought this game thinking it would be good but I was thinking wrong. Let me just say that this game stinks real bad. I played Virtua Tennis on the XBOX and PS2 and they were good games. However on this PSP the game is a complete letdown. I don't know if it's just me but during points this game will flicker a bit. Also the players look completly fake. The players play styles doesn't match. I wish this scale had 0 stars because this game is a complete waste of resources. I watch tennis and know the players styles so I know what I'm talking about. If your going to buy this game please don't. If you really want a good tennis game for the PSP get ""Smash Court Tennis 3"" as it puts this Virtua Tennis to shame. I also should mention that the game is a dark.. I just don't like this game at all."
159,1,This game sucks and it is boring. 5 stars my as*
160,1,"Instead of this, I got some weird Japanese shears or scissors or something. It's not worth my time to send it back but I have no use for it and it's not what I asked for. It was even labeled wrong."
161,1,"I run a new high-performance PC and it is painfully obvious that Need for Speed: Most Wanted was not made for this type of computer (3.3 GHz quad core 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 650 TI, Windows 7 64-bit). They may have spent thousands of hours developing the game BUT they didn't spend 3 hours configuring it for PC. It's simply not consistent. Everything is by luck of the draw; you may be able to configure your controller on one start up and be able to configure a few of the controller functions but then you can't do other controller functions. There is no rhyme or reason. It posts notice or warning messages on top of one another so you can't see the one below the one on top. It tells you to pushbuttons that don't exist on your keyboard or controller. Sometimes, there will be a picture of the enter button on the keyboard and other times that picture isn't there. This is important because sometimes you're supposed to push the (6) button but since it's not showing any buttons it's just blank so you have absolutely no idea what button to push. I am an experienced PC user and have verified the operation of my controller. I have Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010 and after several hours was able to get it to operate correctly but it too was very ""glitchy"" when it came to the initial set up. This is just a very poor piece of work for use on a PC. EA and Criterion should go to the shopping mall and learn the same lesson that Microsoft is learning; Apple is doing a land office business because their stuff actually works!"
162,1,"I purchased these from Newegg rather than Amazon. I was not impressed with the sound quality at all. The audio seemed to have a slight muffled quality and low volume. I cranked the inline volume control all the way up just to get it to be at a normal audio level. The mic was so barely audible that it was useless. I tried setting the recording volume to the max in my sound settings on my PC and it didn't fix it. In order to get it to pick up anything at all I'd have to shout into the mic. Tried both the jacks on the front panel of my PC and on the back directly into my motherboard with no luck. There is also too much bass. You lose the clarity of the sound effects because of the bass reverb causing everything to blend into a rumble which I didn't like at all and there's no way to adjust bass levels. They also fit really tight and pinch your ears. I tried adjusting the headband but all that did was make it looser on the top of my head while the earphones still squeezed tight. I was disappointed all around by this headset and RMA'd it for a refund pretty much right away. They are cheap, but not worth it. I'd rather just use my earbuds I have laying around than this headset. Next headset I buy is going to be another USB headset like my old one that died and not analog like this one. I really don't get how this headset is getting overall positive reviews."
163,1,"nope it froze and it doesn't work.
took it to a shop and turns out game is a fake."
164,1,came broken.. luckily i bought the one so i don't have to use this peice of crap.
165,1,"the game is not complete, it is a scam, to see the true end you have to purchase the Collector's Edition"
166,1,"If I could, I would give this game a zero. One of the biggest aspects of the game is the MUT mode (Madden Ultimate Team). This mode is built broken, in order to get people to purchase Madden coins online. Yep... pay $60 for the game and then you can spend hundreds more trying to build a team that can compete in this mode. More EA garbage. Madden used to be a great series."
167,1,"Awful!! Those people that gave this game good reviews are making money in some way from the sale of this game. I heard it was similar to the X-Men Legends game (which was great) so I didn't think twice about picking it up. I could not have been more disappointed. Graphics stink, gameplay is awful...I can't think of anything nice to say about it.

I should have seen it coming...the commercials for the game have no actual footage or screenshots from the game. The animation on the commercial looks nothing like the game. Multi player mode is even worse than single which stinks.

If you just feel the need to get rid of 50 bucks....flush it down the toilet and cut your losses. You'll feel better about yourself than if you actually spend money on this crap and then feel obligated to play it."
168,1,"Ok so this is a complete failure in trying to get a transformers game out on the new consoles. If they would've just done a fall of cybertron remastered edition with a few more levels in campaign I would've been much happier.

Fall of cybertron was the best transformers game I had ever played and multiplayer wise it was the best experience I had with conquest, escalation, capture the flag, and my favorite of course the deathmatch. True player on player competition.

Hopefully they could redeem themselves by creating a patch and adding these modes.

They also removed the customization of your own unique bots.

Edge of reality basically hurt the high moon series badly.

That being said there are a few additions that are welcome but lack of new weapons, killing the multiplayer, and not a big jump in graphics it falls short dramatically. If I was an executive for activision I would be pushing the development team to build a patch to release to make up for this failure of a rushed product. Games can still be fixed, updated, and made better after the launch with PSN. If a patch comes out addressing these issues it could be a great game until then it's the only transformers game available on PS4.

If you loved the multiplayer of fall of cybertron you will be disappointed. If you haven't played any of the foc series and are a newbee that doesn't care about online gaming you might like this game a lot. If you are a kid under 13 you probably won't care and enjoy it as a transformers game.

I hope this puts it into perspective for you. Please leave some feedback or comments."
169,1,"Mine came in a plain white box, and was clearly cheap, low quality build compared to the orginal. DO NOT BUY."
170,1,I went ahead and bought some control freaks after buying these which offer generously speaking very little on the PlayStation 4 controller - if anything they're  slightly annoying. They're also really difficult to get on. Skip it. Gimmick
171,1,Not a fan. Would not recommend
172,1,stupid game. played for about 30 minutes then just gave it away. save your money
173,1,"You know, for a racing game, you'd think you'd have control over your own car. Instead, you swerve all over the place on clear, dry roads and take turns at 15 mph while your CPU opponents don't have to slow down."
174,1,"Just bought and installed the game, can't even play 1 minute of the game, constantly getting error messages , Blizzard are f..ing clowns. ... Don't buy this game !!!"
175,1,"Pros -

- Comes pre-loaded with a nice size data base of codes

Cons -

- Setup can either be really easy or one of the most frustrating situations ever encounter in your life

- Could not get the device to recognize properly / update on windows 7 64 bit machine.

- Attempted all the various work arounds , manual firmware updates , and driver work arounds on official support forums.

- Little to no support for device ."
176,1,Worked for a little while then just stopped. We done gave up on it and went back to using batteries.
177,1,"Very, very, very obsolete, ffiv(ii) aged very poorly, remakes improves over original 10-100-1000 times
My gripes for this version are:
1)graphics are awful, more then a snes game, this looks as a nes game.
2)easy version for the us audience, is too damn easy
3)no dush button, the game is terrible slow
4)very bad and censored script
5) Where's the ATB gauge? without gauge, the ATB is pointless
6) conversion is terrible! Cut everything! Cut magics, cut skills, censored text, cut out difficulty, this is tolerable?

My gripes for this game itself
1) music is annoying, 20 seconds MIDI endlessly repeated
2)short game, less then 20 hours
3)The plot has absolutely zero depth or detail
4)primitive gameplay, no job system, no esper system, no materia system, nothing of nothing
5)don' t even choose party members, the story choose your party ( most strategic game ever eh?)
6)the game world is too generic, no information at all. The game has 8 countries, but, you do not know anything about them.
7) no description of items
8) in the equipment shops, you don't see the changes of statistics
9)too large party so little time, characters don't receive a true development besides kain or cecil
10)Rosa is the worst feminine character ever, zero depht, zero background, I don't know any information about her, besides she's the white mage of the castle and love Cecil
11)Cecil start evil? Don't make me laugh!!!! In the very first scene it's already a good guy!
12)dungeons are boring! Cave, cave, cave, cave, mountain , cave, cave, cave....

Graphics 1/10
sound 5/10
story 3/10
characters development 5/10
gameplay 4/10
fun factor 3/10

Whit this UNBIASED review of ff2(4)I'm trying to help the new rpg gamers often deceived from nostalgic o fanboy reviewers.
My advertise? If you want so badly play final fantasy 4 try the psp version( the best version) is 100% improvement over this, or try the ds version if you like cartonish and blocking graphics.
 Stay away from the terrible gba version, loaded with bugs, bad control, bad sound and low difficult.
 Psx version is basically uncensored japanese hard-type snes version with a couple of fmv and the dash button, decent version but really no any real improvement."
178,1,Ripoff :(
179,1,"This game is terrible!!!  The game doesn't give you any idea of where the ball is going which results in:

Having no idea where serves are going to go.

Never knowing whether or not the ball will be out.

Having no idea where to go when the player lobs it.

This was the most frustrating, un-fun videogame I have ever played in my life.  STAY AWAY FROM IT COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!"
180,1,"We were more than patient with you with BF 1942 because it was revolutionary and eventually the patches caught up and there was expansion goodness for everyone.

We were forgiving with BF Vietnam for the balancing, bugginess, lack of standard features, and maps just so we could have all the helicopter goodness.

We were excited and then quickly disappointed by BF 2 with all the same problems showing up yet a third time along and a lacking of features promised in the last two versions along with a crop of other things such as rampant cheating and patch updates that were almost non-existant.

I'll admit we're a bit slow, but if you think we're going to throw money yet a fourth time your way, for what amounts to a mod, a buggy mod at that, with the great new feature being adware, wow you're dumber than we are.

I for one am going to pass.  I'll check back in six months, if it lasts that long.  Hopefully by then all the patches and balancing will be done.  If that is the case, then I'll think about picking it up.

JUST TO BE FAIR

Just be fair I went back and gave it another try. Here is how it went.

Another 22 hour download. Nice
Reintstalled Dx9
Reinstalled game
Game crashed first attempt, but came up second time no problems.
I see that the jump to center, bug/characteristic is still in the control menu, annoying, but tollerable. It's been there since the 1942 version.
Getting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts. For some reason it was dead set on keeping W set to nothing. I don't use WASD I use ESDF, more keys to the left to use. Similar problems setting up the joystick and mouse, but nothing serious, just had to play a game solo and jump into the menu 10-15 times to keep changing things back, again another characteristic that has been with us since 1942.
Video is similar to BF2, as long as I don't max them out it is very smooth.

No widescreen support, big thumbs down. Closest thing to 1900x1200 is 1600x1200. Some warping, but playable. Sorry kiddies who think wide screen is cheating, I like my 24"" monitor and like having a wider view.

The optimizing shaders annoyance is back from BF2. If you change video setting expect a 5 minute or more wait till it optimizes something. Don't know why this couldn't be done before you try to enter a map in the background, so you are going to be late to the fight the first time after a change.

Game play that I tried was Titan. Interesting concept, though nothing original it's been around since the days of UT and RtCW. Moving around and launching aircraft onboard the Titan is buggy quite a bit of the time. The ship moves around subtly causing things to get hung up.
Weapons seem to be more accurate, but classes feel kind of generalized due to the reduction in total numbers.
Sound quality is still pretty muted and generic, all the weapons sound alike, but at least they've finally figured out what 3d sound is. You know which way it's coming from now.

The powered lift craft, they're not helicopters, they're not airplanes. It feels like they're found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity. BFV they were crazy sensitive, BF2 they felt like you were flying with your hands numb. I personally like things light and sensitive, it took a lot of skill to fly them, but this should help get people up to speed faster and make people less afraid of jumping in with random pilots.

Looks like the helicopter instant roll over and play dead bug is still in the game.

The ground vehicles are so so. The weapons have some interesting characteristics, like the curve ball grenades on the walker. Other than that nothing really new.

Lot's of gun stabilization on vehicle guns finally make accurate passenger support fire possible while on the move.

There is no cover or vegetation which to speak of, but then none of the BF games ever have had much. I like the fatigue bar, but it's a LONG run between things to hide behind, so anyone on foot is still going to be constantly caught out in the open.

The indestructable chain link fences make a return to the game ready to stop your 80 ton tank dead in it's tracks.

Light vehicles aren't all that fast and explode almost instantly upon contact with water. Seems even in the future that is still a problem. The walker can wade accross no problems.

I saw one of the infamous billboards. It was green and simple said ""The Enemy is out there"" So right they are, but I didn't notice any more than that. No adds. I'd rather if they were going to stuff adds in the game to have them in the menu while you are looking for a server to join rather than in the game. The classic ""Brought to you by Brand X"" type placements there would be less strange.

This game feels very much like a mod, it still needs some tweeking to get some things right. The Menu system is still quirky, but seems to be actually stable, which is an absolute first for any BF game. Simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent. It's not hard, but it's not obvious either.

There is nothing that interesting to a long time BF vet to make me want to pay money for it. I find the whole thing kind of boring. There are better games out there that suck you into the action better. It seems that DICE didn't bother lifting any ideas from the many games that have come out since they have come onto the scene.

I downgrade my opinion from flame to yawn.

Wars are dirty, loud, confusing, overwhelming, and dented. This game delivers none of that. Even BF2 for all it's warts still seems to be the much better game."
181,1,Waste of money. Nothing new.
182,1,"8 reasons Thief is the worst game I've played so far of this new generation:

1 - VISIBILITY
the game is so dark i can barely see anything half the time. there is no in-game brightness slider - the game tells you to use YOUR OWN display to adjust brightness. what? just for this one stupid game? then adjust it back for everything else I use it for? and back-n-forth and back-n-forth constantly over-and-over again? that's incredibly inconvenient and flat out stupid. it didn't matter, the game was impossible for me to get through so I had to do it just to be able to see where I was. after adjusting the brightness and contrast, I still struggle to see anything properly and whatever beauty I'm supposed to be witnessing is now completely washed out. this game may end up being the one that has actually physically harmed me (my eyes) the most...Note: I use a projector but there is NO issue with my display as ALL other games function as they should (BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM!) We joked as I went through, ""wow, progressive values have really taken hold. I never thought I'd be able to play a game developed BY BLIND PEOPLE!!!!"" Others in the room joked, ""they should have called THIS game 'The Darkness'""

2 - CINEMATICS
at the end of the first level the game completely froze during what was obviously (based on the latter dialog of other characters) a VERY IMPORTANT cut scene. i completely missed what happened in the story as a result. Something happened to the main female character. alive? dead? missing? were there bad guys there? did they kill, abduct her? me? something happened to me...I have no idea what the hell happened - that scene is gone...stupid. at the end of the game, you beat a boss (the battle itself is a bit stupid). You go from beating the boss in the middle of a ship, to a confounding cinematic in which the boss is somehow dramatically hanging on a ledge of the ship (like at the end of Die Hard) nowhere near where they once were (did they teleport?)...as the 7-year-old in the room remarked ""why does that even matter, there's water below""). The boss acted as if they would fall to their death. Why? The fall looked like 20 feet at the most and into gentle water. Can they not swim?

3 - TONE
the main character seems to have 2 tones, sarcastic and sarcastic a-hole. actually that describes everyone's character. what motivation is supposed to propel the gamer through toward the end? why steal everything? for what? to live in the worst, most miserable city ever? It's like a medieval Detroit. The Theives Guild series of quests in Skyrim, which were somewhat generic, at least made some kind of sense...you'll stole a bunch of stuff to restore the guild to it's former glory and rose in it's ranks...but why are we here in Thief? we appear to be stealing everything not nailed down, even from poor harmless victims...for what? so now the city will even be worse? not much back story to explain the main character's motivations. I liked or sympathized with 0 characters in this game. if you nuked it from orbit, I wouldn't care, nor would you...probably nor would they....

4 - NAVIGATION
the map is utterly useless, even counter-intuitive. if you can't remember how to get back to such-n-such place (which will happen regularly as quests are assigned) and consult the map, the map may lead you into a solid wall, a complete closed off area, etc... you also continuously LOSE the smaller corner map every time you save, transition, etc. Annoying. Also annoying are the multiple button presses that it takes to get to the big map. as the map isn't very pretty or inspiring, at least they should have made it useful. the map coupled with struggling to be able to see things properly made getting from point A-to-B maddening. Navigation and mobility, which you'd think you'd want to be functioning well as you're a thief, are the biggest (unintentional) challenges in the game.

5 - DIALOG
dialog is idiotic and repetitive. all the characters bitch that they wish they had some coffee. is this world barren of coffee? robotic character animations are repetitive. if you have subtitles turned on, you'll see inaudible dialog repeated over and over and over. i turned it off. the audio is weird in many places. you'll overhear characters that are supposed to be inside (giving you clues as to where treasures are), as clear as day...

6 - RESPAWN
enemies annoyingly constantly re-spawn (similar to Farcry2). no way to get rid of them permanently. once you feel like you've stealthfully gotten past them once or twice in the proper ghostly way, you'll get bored of that...I ended up just running past most of them for the rest of the game...combat isn't particularly interesting. you can fire an arrow or 2 or hit someone with a sap. and that's it.

7 - STEALING
the game's called Thief, so hows the stealing part? pretty mundane. it's not particularly broken. but it isn't unique or interesting relative to other games. sneak past dude. crawl. sneak past some other dude. steal thing. unlock thing. steal other thing...sneak and escape. unlocking stuff is a simple affair. rotate thumb stick...based on some of the other fundamental things being completely broken (being able to see, navigation), I'm actually glad they didn't decide to do some extravagant unique auteur idea here...it probably would have completely misfired...

8 - COMPETITION
the game's natural competitors are Assassin's Creed, Dishonored, Hitman, and other similar stealth-based titles like the original Splinter Cell...Thief has NOTHING over any of these games. Not even 1 unique bullet point or thing-that-works-better or aesthetic or anything at all...Go play those games instead. I can't compare it to other games in the Thief franchise. I haven't played them. This entry does not make me want to...

COMPLETE UTTER FAILURE"
183,1,"I bought this game a couple months back during a sale. If you  want to play the single player alone and don't care about multiplayer I would suggest picking up this game for around 5-10 dollars.

If you are looking for multiplayer I would look elsewhere. When playing multiplayer on steam it is bugged and will always return 0/0 players in any game mode, you basically have to leave it on the most popular type TDM and pray you hit a match.

When in these games the connections have significantly deteriorated the life of the product. Before I used to get almost full ping each match and now one bar is the norm.

IW and steam seem to have zero interest in fixing any of the issues or the hacked lobbies. They did take the time to shut down alterIW net which offered a bett multiplayer experience.

I would look elsewhere for a good FPS, and I wouldn't start with MW3 either."
184,1,"Dont get me wrong, killing Nazis is fun and all, but you need the game to be more then just that. And after all the hype, all the delays, they fail. The graphics are poor. The first window i shot cracked in the most unbelievable way. The enemy AI became very predictable in there standard duck and cover movements. The overly long cut scenes were irreverent and the fact i couldn't skip them just added to the flavor or S@#! that was already in my mouth from the start of the game. It made my want to go get Call of Duty 3 again.

Dont buy, either wait for COD:WAT or just go get COD 4 and play that.

1/5

PS, i got it for free and it still sucked."
185,1,"Here we go again, Capcom. They pulled the same crap with Street Fighter 4. Capcom releases an ""ok"" game with a better version already in the works. I should have known better than to buy this. From now on if a Capcom games looks good, I will wait 2 years and buy it dirt cheap.
This game is fun. If you liked MvC2, you will definitely like MvC3. The graphics are pretty sweet. Nice comic book feel. Now the background is kind of ""busy"". Some people can't get used to all the comotion and moving in the background. I got used to it and don't even pay attention to it anymore.
Like I said, this game is fun. It is a good fighter. ***BUT DO NOT BUY IT*** Capcom is, again, screwing it's fans by releasing a better version soon."
186,1,"Bought two at wal-mart to use with the Wii. They do work with it, but very soon after I bought them the analog sticks began to stick in one direction, and they occasionally 'lock up' and need the batteries reseated to work again. Now one controller won't even move in one direction.

Junk."
187,1,Buggy hardly any servers available. Always ask for upgrades which means spending more Money. EA sucks.
188,1,"The basic idea behind the game sounds fun. You're an SAS officer, sent off on a number of missions to save the world. It's a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.
The emphasis is on ""real-world"" fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.
There are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in ""real-time"". If you're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.
This ""real-world"" emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance ""reality"" with ""fun"". Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot (as it were).
I couldn't even get past the first level on ""normal"" difficulty. I'm not that bad at games (I've completed Half-life, Star Trek Elite Force etc.), but try as I might I couldn't get through the first mission. I'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there's no save game feature, so you have to go back to the start of the level. A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I'd already completed, shoot the sniper... and then got shot by someone else. Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again!
After I'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead.
As far as the rest of the game goes, other than the outdoor maps, there is very little special about the graphics - they're pretty much Quake2 engine standard (sub Half-Life). All that running around, climbing ladders etc. is pretty passe these days (how old is Tomb Raider ?), and there is really nothing new that this game does.
I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review. As it stands, without a save game feature, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. If Eidos get around to patching the game (there's no sign of it yet), and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again. As it stands, I'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition... ""The element is behind you!"" or Counterstrike.
Pro: 1. The satelite camera is quite cool. 2. Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS.
Con 1. You cant save your game. 2. Too easy on ""easy"". 3. Impossible on any difficulty setting above ""easy"" (partly because there is no save game option). 4. No multiplayer. 5. Dodgy voice acting."
189,1,"I loved the original Sim City and I thought Sim City 2000 was probably one of the best games for the PC ever... I also had Sim City 3000 which is where the buggy interface started detracting from the gameplay and I had Sim City 4 back when it originally came out and the game was basically unplayable. I had hoped after many years without thinking about it that they'd have 'fixed' the game but they haven't...

Sim City 4 Deluxe is too buggy to play... I had it on for just an hour or so and the game just closed, no warning, no opportunity to save... even during play setting up roads and water pipes aren't fun because things just don't work like they should- To get roads and highways to connect like you want is a real pain- this is a GAME it's supposed to be FUN- don't tell me these roads don't fit together- just MAKE THEM FIT... the same with rewards and special items like the Marina- it takes forever to find a suitable spot to place these things- once again- let me place them and let the game deal with whatever is has to to make them fit.

Worse then the play options was the setting up of the game... It takes 2 discs to install - the second disc however was bad/blank... my computers couldn't see ANY data on the disc and the install wouldn't complete- I had to borrow the 2nd disc from someone else to complete the install- if I didn't know someone with it I'd be out of luck.

Everything about this box is annoying like this... avoid it- this isn't the Sim City you remember. :(

Also laptop users- FYI- the outside of the box says that laptop video cards (even if they meet the 128 MB memory requirement) are NOT SUPPORTED- they may work, they may not and if they don't the publisher doesn't want to hear about it- so don't waste your money or time if you planned to use this on a laptop."
190,1,"I was excited to try and bring back some memories with this new version of THPS, but this was a massive letdown. The graphics are poor, there's no ""create a skater,"" and worst of all, the mechanics were just terrible."
191,1,"The controller is nice, very much like the real xbox controller, however big problem I ran into with this thing, the directional pad is stiffer than the nipples on a manikin, if they had nipples that is. It is so unresponsive, trying to play side scrollers or a game that utilizes the directional pad is beyond unbearable. You literally have to use the entire force of your thumb muscles in order to get some feed back from this thing. I don't know  if you guys will get a hit or miss if you are looking to purchase this controller. It sucks because I really wanted to like this controller too. :(."
192,1,"Before anyone trolls me or tries to correct me, this is my opinion for the game. I will start by saying that I played this for about an hour. I have a stressful job to begin with. This game is the epitome of stress. It's chaotic and ultraviolent. It starts off a little slow... But the transition is quick. It goes from slow to full throttle in about 5 seconds, and stays at full throttle for the rest of the game. It's like driving a nice scenic route on the California coastline, but at 200 mph. So you miss the scenery, you miss the immersion, you just hold on for the hell of holding on.

It could have been more immersive. But the immersion is lost immediately. There are carnival games you can play and people to talk to in the first bit of the game. First bit being the first five minutes. However as soon as you pass through a certain gate, the mayhem begins.

The enemy AI is erratic at best. You're under attack from quite literally everyone. Police. Firemen. Gun turrets. Religious Zealots. And everyone has a gun. Why you're under attack is silly. You're the Anti-Christ. You get a pistol and shot gun and everyone else has either an assault rifle or a flame thrower. You're basically screwed from the get go.

There is no map. So you don't know where you're supposed to go. There is no sort of radar so the enemies have the upper hand no matter what. They outgun you in strength and numbers and you have no idea where they are. I get that some people may be into that sort of thing, but frankly I found it to be stressful and frustrating at best.

The controls are janky as all hell. You aim your gun by clicking the joystick you move with. So you either aim by accident or move while you're trying to aim. There are no sights on your guns either. So you basically shoot from the hip even if you aim.

Apparently you have psychic powers but using them is usually the result of pressing the wrong button thus using up the psychic powers and not having them available when you need them. I kept pressing the button that usually used for aiming (in EVERY OTHER FPS) only to find out that I've used up my psychic powers and now I can't hack that gun turret that's shooting me in the back.

They gaming itself was so shallow that I didn't even care about the story. So don't ask.

So I know a lot of people might read this and say that I suck at the game. In my opinion this game was just poorly designed. I played the first two Bioshocks. They were ok. They weren't great, but they were passable. This just pissed me off. I'm sure if this game came out 15 years ago, or for that matter 10 years ago, it'd be a great game and a classic at that. This was just a stressful heap of garbage."
193,1,"The copy I received has incredibly poor quality case art, almost looks like someone printed it off a desktop printer that was low on ink.  After reading multiple other reviews pointing out that these may be fake, I didn't even bother opening it and just returned it for a refund.  I stopped in a big box store and looked at their version, and the quality difference is night and day.  My order was fulfilled by a third party, and not directly by Amazon so be aware when you're ordering."
194,1,"I purchased this game because I'd played the original Jade Cocoon and liked it.  I'd already read reviews about Jade Cocoon 2, so I knew it wouldn't be like the original.  Still, I never expected it to be so bad.  I wasn't even able to finish the game.  I even picked it up again (after awhile of inactivity) to try to force myself to finish it, but I couldn't.  I really did consider finishing it to see if it got any better, but after reading numerous reviews/faqs/wikipedia, I realized that it wasn't going to get better.  So, rather than trudge through the rest of this abysmal game, I decided that I'd better quit before I wasted any more of my life.  I don't normally write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I really feel like I need to share my opinion on this one so I can inform others of what they might be getting into if they buy this game.  It's really not any one thing alone that makes this game unbearable; it's a combination of several things that bogs it down.  Well, let's take a look...

Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics themselves are technically decent, but not really too impressive.

Music (score 4/10): Ouch. Music is incredibly bland and generic. I almost didn't notice that there was music.  The voice actors try their best to invigorate the terrible dialogue, but many fail.  Furthermore, some voices chosen for characters were incredibly irritating--especially the voice of that guy who stores items for you.

Characters (score 4/10): Remember how I mentioned the crummy dialogue earlier?  Well, this really ruins the characters.  Dialogue is VERY repetitive (a lot like the rest of this game).  Kahu repeats every statement made to him back in the form of a question.  ""Kahu, you need to get the forest orbs."" --""So, I need to get the forest orbs?""  Urg!  This sort of exchange happens constantly.  Kahu seems to be amazingly stupid.  While other characters are amusing in a small way (like Yamu) it doesn't save this section from a poor score since most everyone is either gratuitously stupid or simply poorly developed.

Story (score 2/10): Talk about non-existent.  What little story that exists is incredibly trite.  Kahu wants to become a beast hunter but then he gets cursed for touching a fairy cocoon.  Now he must collect 4 forest orbs to lift the curse.  There are several subplots along the way, but none of them are particularly interesting.  The story really suffers from the pace of it (slow) and the way it's told.  The bits of story are revealed by talking to people in the dungeons.  Sometimes there is a scene (mostly monologues by the fairy Nico), but mostly it consists of simply exchanging a conversation.  There wouldn't be anything wrong with this if it were paced better.  But the game drags on and on forever, with a lot of level grinding.  This really slows the story to a snail's pace and makes you forget why you are even playing this game.  With all this you'd think the gameplay made up for it, right? Well, let's see.

Battle System (score 5/10): This part's not so bad, but it does have its irritating bits.  Selecting attacks is turn-based, and battle involves having several monsters arranged on a wheel surrounding Kahu.  They can only carry one move for each element, and then can only use the move of the element that they are placed on in the wheel.  Furthermore, you can't choose which enemy the monster attacks--it's random.  Plus, monsters can only use their moves that take up MP; they only use normal attacks once their MP runs out.  That makes for a frustrating experience. Otherwise, I would've been fine with the battle system.

Gameplay (score 1/10): Repetitive is the word of the day.  There is only one ""town"" (and it's dull).  Dungeons are long and boring, and each one looks just like the others, only a different color.  There was just no variety--and in a game that's basically a dungeon-crawler, this is bad.  To make matters worse, the monster raising system is very unrewarding.  When you merge a monster, the appearance doesn't even change (unlike the original Jade Cocoon).  Further, monsters stop leveling up at level 20, forcing you to merge them, which resets their levels to 1.  This really ruins any sense of accomplishment you had, because monsters revert to their weak-looking baby forms. It really sucks the fun out of the game.

Overall (score 2/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Sigh, the first couple hours of this game are really fun-- before you get sick of it, that is. I wasn't able to force myself to finish this game, and I don't see why I should have to.  A game is supposed to be for fun, not something I should force myself to do.  I just don't think I could recommend this game to anyone--except maybe the most diehard of dungeon-crawling fans."
195,1,I wanted to play this game bad on a console. Only to find out you have to be connected to the internet. Screw you ms I'm not paying online just to play this game. Not very nice supporters for people that play offline.
196,1,"I'm not really a gamer, more of a Star Wars Fan.  I really liked ""Shadows of the Empire"" back 20 years ago.  I don't play games online and I'm not much interested in multiplayer games.  I've played this game for about 2 days now, and it just consists of running around in circles killing enemies ad nauseum in shockingly constricted areas.  Haven't flown an X-wing (except in the tutorial), haven't driven an AT-AT.  The scenarios don't seem to have any objectives, other than pure killing.  Maybe once a Guidebook comes out I'll learn something about this game I can;t learn on my own.  So far it sucks."
197,1,"Don't waste your money.  As frustrating as Wii Boxing can be .  I find the controls to be way more responsive in Wii Boxing.  At least in Wii Boxing I know when the punches are connecting but in Victorious Boxers missing a punch and connecting a punch seem the same to me.

The first 2 control options which use the remote and the nunchuck to punch seem to work fine in the tutorial but is a crap shoot during sparring.  I didn't even fell like wasting my time with the story mode at this point.

For now Wii Boxing with all of it's flaws is the ""King of the Ring"" as it is still way more fun and a lot less frustrating than Victorious Boxers.  Best to just wait for something else to come along."
198,1,Would not recomend at all. Bad ideas after bad ideas. They are giving baseball games a bad reputation. Where is EA Sports!?
199,1,"RATING: Awful

Horrendous framerate, repetitive quests, nonsensical story, glitched achievements (I beat the game on the hardest difficulty and received nothing), this is easily one of worst games I've ever played."
200,1,Do not buy this. Do not buy this I repeat over and over. Right trigger does not work.  Total waste of money.  I learned my lesson the hard way. This controller needs to be taken off any sellers and junked
201,1,"The first PE had problems - Aya's painfully slow movement, some bad camera angles, etc. - but was overall a good game.  This ... this is a travesty.
First, the movement system is *miserable*.  Character-relative movement is an abomination, painful, and results in many many deaths.  Second, Aya's Parasite powers are pathetic - how did she go from taking on Eve and the Ultimate Being to this!?  Eve would have turned this Aya into mincemeat.  Third, why is Aya suddenly young and dressing in bizarre fashion?  I dunno about you, but *I'd* wear body armor, or at least long pants, when confronted with creatures like that.
In terms of plot and characterization ... there isn't any that I had the patience to see.  Aya's sole reaction on seeing a human (or apparent human) mutate boils down to so what.  This, from a woman who freaked at seeing the rat mutate, who has not seen anything else mutate since finishing off the Ultimate Being ... who seemed to think nothing else was going to mutate.
Stupid puzzles, uninteresting secondary characters (where's Ben?  Maeda?  Daniel?  Wayne?) ...
Pass on this one.  Play the original again."
202,1,"This game is hands down one of the worst shooters I've ever played.  Imagine a ""rail shooter"" in the arcades like House of the Dead or Time Crisis and you'll have some idea of what to expect here. Much like those games, you won't be able to control the movement of your character, so you'll automatically move from place to place. Along the ""rails"", you'll be expected to shoot any targets you see, but there's no strategy invovled.  Die, and you'll face the exact same path again, with the same targets in the same places.

In the middle of a battle, the camera will often spin in 180 degree turns to ""shock"" you by throwing another target in front of you. When you're in an arcade (or on a console with a light gun), this sort of ""twitch"" game can be fun. In light gun games, you aim a real gun at the screen, shoot characters, reload...rinse repeat.  Unfortunately, this game has no light gun....so you do all of this with the standard controller. The action in this game is sort of like being stuck in the Warthog turret in a game of Halo with a crazy driver who has never played the game before....except it's a lot less fun than that would be.

In Attack of the Movies 3D, you aim your gun with the thumbsticks, and the right one seems to work better than the left. Turning your controller upside down helps a bit with this I suppose, but why would you want to play a game that requires that?  Needless to say, aiming is difficult, and the thumbsticks are no substitute for a real light gun. The ""3D"" levels are a joke (it's the old cardboard red and blue glasses and I thought the game looked better without them). Speaking of the graphics, this looks like a PS2 game...or maybe something for the Wii. Don't waste your money on this game, unless you are morbidly curious to see what one of the worst shooters of all time will feel like.

205,1,"I bought this game on Xbox and was looking to get this on PC.  I will not buy any more rockstar games. Period.

I will not be purchasing the game because along with it comes the malware virus infection known as SecuROM. It also requires internet activation. I honestly still play games that I purchased 15 years ago, and with this game requiring internet activation I may not be able to play it in the future.

When will these companies learn that ALL SECUROM DOES is harm and inconvenience legitimate customers? They are creating more piracy as a result.

Paying customers get the shaft and pirates (who probably would have no problem buying the game if it wouldn't infect their computer with viruses) get the cracked version that doesn't require internet activation."

207,1,"I'll keep this simple.  If you've played the demo - that is the game.  The AI is poor, you can catch possible homeruns by running THROUGH the wall (yes you are a ghost it seems).  And after playing franchise mode for a day, fatigue does not seem to factor into the game at all. PLus, as others have pointed out, the game is just really buggy.  I understand the contract 2K has to make this game is running short and it seems they are just tossing out a hurried project instead of really working on it to make it amazing like NBA 2K11.

The way you have to pitch is great and the camera angles are wonderful as is the commentary.  For me though, I want to be able to play a realistic game of baseball more than have spectacular commentary.  However, in this day and age why not have both?"
208,1,"Don't usually write reviews.  But after buying a brick of a mouse for Cataclysm (not sure who made that), I figured well Razer makes good quality items. I have a Tron mouse that I got on closeout and love it.

The packaging for $139 is mostly cheap plastic, not a cool box like I'm used to from Razer.  The mouse is neat.  Feels a little big but I imagine that's to do with all the buttons on the side.

Where you run into the problem is when you update and load the software.  Then you CANNOT save your setup.  The LED can be changed to any color you'd like, but every time you exit that program or reboot, its back to default.  What is the point of having a mouse with configurable buttons and no ability to save your setup?

You've got all those buttons but no matter how you program them they will just go back to default.

Their website is atrocius for trying to find a fix.  It looks cool (but the faction insignia is always yellow so it doesn't match the mouse wheel), and might be good, but since they apparently don't beta test their firmware upgrades, its a nice doorstop.  I'll just stick with my logitech which is smaller and cheaper.

Why I won't be returning it is because of the 2 per character exclusive green-black color crystals.  So they got my money and will keep it.

So I gave it 1 out of 5 since it's non-functional as a programable mouse.  But its Star Wars and it looks cool.  If they fix it and actually explain how to do that on their website somewhere where you can actually easily find it, then I'd give it a 3 out of 5, as its not small enough in my hands to be truly comfortable."

It's beautiful as ever, with the same house-crashing physics we came to enjoy in crysis, plus some additional content. It is short, very short on easy difficulty.

The gameplay does not warrant the DRM, nor does the updated engine warrant it. After beating it, I tried to uninstall it, and unfortunately had a lengthy battle with securom totaling more time than I spent on the game.

They will most likely release a patch that removes the DRM once the main group of sales is done. Wait until then, you'll get a better product for less money and less trouble."
210,1,"This game was the reason I bought my Xbox One (to go with my PS4 that I've had since launch). It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.

As of 12/1/14:

* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.

* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.

* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.

* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.

* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.

* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.

* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.

I'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up. If they fix the problems and the price goes down to $30ish, you should buy this game. But this game alone should not affect your decision between X1 and PS4."
211,1,"I have been playing video games my entire life and this game is the worst game I have ever played.

I've played it before at a friends, it was ""okay"" but not 60 dollars, save your money get Deadspace 2 for 9-10 dollars on amazon currently, MUCH BETTER GAME, and for 1/6th the price.

Regardless of the fixes coming in the upcoming patches, it is completely unacceptable to release a game before it is ready, and to make excuses for shoddy business practices.

EDITEDIT:  Patch 4 update 10/16/13 at bottom

It's been about a week, and I still don't feel I can fully put into words my complicated feelings about this game.

So much of it, for me, is a comparison with previous games.  Rome Total War was one of the best of the franchise, only superseded by Medieval II Total War, which was essentially the exact same game, but with more features and better graphics.

The best I can say for Rome 2 is that it's better than Empire Total War and Napoleon Total War, though that's not really saying much.

As well, it took this game for me to realize that, aside from Medieval II, Total War Shogun 2 was the best of the ""modern"" Total War games, with a truly engaging campaign map that was short and well-defined (25 years or so over 200 turns in the main game, 10 years over 200 turns in Fall of the Samurai) giving you plenty of time to work with your family members and agents and overall policy for your clan.  Battles were actually discernible and fun to watch, particularly as each individual unit seemed to be able to lock on to an enemy or two, with some groups getting into mini-duels with a single opponent, often to have one of their comrades step in and abruptly end it with a quick stab to the other duelist.  There was enough of an RPG element and a balance in AI (to some degree) so that you could predict which clans would behave stupidly, and which would maintain strong alliances.

Rome 2 doesn't deviate too far from this setup, and is much more like Shogun 2 than the original Rome Total War.  But something about it just doesn't work.

For one, there's the passage of time.  Shogun 2 worked because there was plenty of time to do stuff in a year's time in-game, so you could decide the fate of your clan within a period of just a year or two, or even draw out a war of attrition into something that could span a decade.  In Rome 2, each turn has 1 year pass.  Combining this with the incredibly slow movement of units on the campaign map, and you have a situation less like the first game and more similar to Medieval II's campaign map, where a journey which should take months ends up taking almost a decade or more.

Medieval II was trying to cram 500 years of Medieval history into a 200 turn game, and compensated by having the game mechanics operate on a 2 turns per year system (much like RTW).  This means that characters and agents aged at a rate of 6 months per turn, which could make it ridiculous to have a King reign for 200 years and only be 80 or so.  But in Rome 2, characters age with the turns, so the vast majority of your generals, admirals, named characters, and agents, will be well into their middle ages by the time they're accomplished generals, even if they are fighting in frequent wars.

Nothing in the game allows for this 1 turn per year to be even remotely realistic, and given that such an emphasis is now placed on generals (ie, you NEED a general or an admiral in order to lead armies) you may as well not even bother polishing and grooming them into being your game's Caesar or Alexander or Alcibiades, because they'll die of old age by the time they've got a full army and plenty of battle experience.

This effect was somewhat similar in Rome Total War (2turns per year), yet there you had the versatility of a Family Tree---it wouldn't be wise to focus on a single character, but you could polish and groom him and his children, and establish a veritable dynasty of men that you craft to be master generals or master administrators or master politicians, even going so far as to pass down ancillaries (like tutors, mentors, pet dogs, family heirlooms, custom armor, sacred artifacts) from generation to generation, and feel a genuine sense of loss if that family member dies without passing on the ancillaries.

In Rome 2, there's absolutely none of that.  No family tree, no valuable ancillaries you could risk losing, nothing particularly special other than the exact same trees of traits you can pick for characters that contribute virtually nothing to the character.  Whereas in Rome Total War, a character could have a foul temper, and have it affect his influence, or a mental illness which affects his troops' morale, in Rome 2, there's only room for 3 traits that come entirely at random, followed by skills that add to things like ""zeal"", ""authority"", and  which contribute little to nothing to the character at all, particularly since they die of old age so quickly.

The campaigns themselves are another disastrous mess...

One of my worries about modding the game (particularly to increase the number of turns per year) was the risk of too-fast growth and expansion.  For example, Medieval II Total War was designed to be 2 years per turn, and so the growth of cities reflects the sort of gradual growth that would span centuries, even if named characters live much longer than humanly possible.  No matter how fast you grew or conquered, you were unlikely to trigger such events as the discovery of Gunpowder or the recruiting of Plate-armored Knights by the 1100s, whereas if you decreased the years in each turn, you could see your nation conquer half of Europe with musketmen and cannons, and an expedition heading to America by 1200 AD.

Even in Rome Total War, whereas in real history, Rome expanded in fits and spurts, rapidly expanding during certain war periods, and remaining steady and consolidating their gains over decades, so that the breakdown of the Republic occurred by the 80s BC, in-game, you could easily consolidate your gains, and spark an End-Game situation as early as the 190s BC, and see Rome dominating everything west of Greece by 140s BC, facing off against the Seleucids or Egypt or Parthia dominating everything east of Greece.

Despite this, it appears my fears are somewhat unfounded in this game, not just due to the poor pacing and slow movement of everything, but due to two factors; AI passivity and the horrendous new Province/Settlement system.

The game AI is no better or worse than average for Total War, except that in the campaign map, everyone seems so idle and passive.  More than 100 turns into the game, no one has ever declared war on me out of the blue, and of the dozen or so factions that have been wiped out, more than half of them were wiped out by me and my expansion.  I feel that I could easily set this to last 500 turns, 4 turns per year, and little would change over the scope of the campaign without my interference.

This doesn't bother me -too- much, but this is a Total War game, not a Civilization game.  This is a problem of trying to fit so much history into a single campaign.  I feel that Medieval Total War did it best, by having three separate campaigns divided by era----early, high, and late.  Even Shogun 2 did it, albeit with DLC and expansion packs, between Rise of the Samurai in the 1170s AD, Sengoku Jidai in 1575-1600, and Fall of the Samurai in 1867-1877 AD.

I feel like if the game had divided into three different eras of Roman history, they could have contained as much as they wanted to in scope, while making the game much more of an aggressive ""Total War"" type game.

As for the Settlement/Province system...

Rome and Medieval II Total War let you build any type of building in any type of settlement, restricted only by population growth and city expansion---you couldn't build huge barracks and mansions in a village of 400 people, but if it grew to 25,000 you could.

By Empire and Napoleon Total War, settlements were reduced to a pre-determined size, with only 5-6 building slots, requiring you to diversify your regions, so one settlement would specialize in infantry, another in cavalry, another in artillery, another in farming, etcetera.  This continued into Shogun 2, with the added bonus of bringing back city expansion, opening up more slots for you to add to your settlements.

Rome 2 has the same thing, but has reduced it down to a sharp scale, to where most settlements will only be able to have 3 buildings, with other settlements able to expand to add another building slot with enough population growth, but there's no clear reason as to why some settlements can grow, and others mysteriously can't.

The map is divided into ""Provinces"" which consist of 2-5 individual settlements, all connected to one another based solely upon the arbitrary delineation of the game creators.  Whereas Athens and Sparta were so fundamentally different that they spoke different dialects of Greek almost unrecognizable to one another, they are lumped together into the province of Hellas for the sole convenience of distance, with the island of Crete added along because the game creators said so.

What this means is that each settlement in the province is linked together.  Whereas in previous games, unhappiness and squalor varied depending on individual cities, as is basic common sense, now it is distributed amongst the settlements, so if one settlement is rich and luxurious, and its neighbor is a slum-ridden wasteland, people will riot in the rich and luxurious settlement, because the game creators said so.

Speaking of unhappiness and squalor...

I really don't even need to say much, but for the sake of a review, I will.  Perhaps the primary cause of the aforementioned timid and passive AI is the ridiculous heaps of squalor from improving virtually every building.

Much of this system seems to borrow heavily from Civilization 5, which as I mentioned in my review of it, actually PUNISHES and PENALIZES you for EXPANDING and GROWING your empire.  It rewards stagnation and not building anything more than necessary to live.

Similarly here, all the basic buildings enable basic services (Farms produce food, field camps produce militia troops, consecrated sites provide order bonuses and culture spread, ports provide basic ships and trade), but the more you upgrade them, the more they penalize you in terms of squalor or food.

EVERY food building (farm, animal herds, fishing ports) will produce tremendous squalor as higher levels.  Squalor contributes DIRECTLY to unhappiness in this game, as opposed to being a percentage of unhappiness that would come together with all the other factors.

EVERY building that isn't food will consume large amounts of food to build, which in turn means you'll need more food buildings, or else you'll have starvation across provinces, which will lead to steep declines in happiness anyway.

So basically, you're PENALIZED for naturally growing and expanding.  Not rushing through anything (you need to research higher and higher level technologies to unlock certain buildings), not cheating to add tons of gold to build the higher level buildings quickly, not doing anything to exploit the in-game system; you are PENALIZED for ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME.

This causes madcap situations like having your lush, well-fed, barely-taxed home region fall into anarchy and rebellion while a region you are freshly conquering is happy and joyous because you've just started building and you've got your full armies stationed there.

Playing as Athens, I had secured all of Greece and Macedonia, made the lunge into Sicily and Italy, and was pacifying northern Italy, wiping out Rome, when suddenly I get the word that Hellas (Athens, Sparta, Hierapytna) was miserable, and public order was plummeting by the double digits.  Squalor?  Massive.  Build up farming and markets?  More squalor.  Build up a fishing port, a trading port, or a naval port?  More squalor.  A barracks to train soldiers?  More squalor.  A brand new plumbing system to help clean up squalor?  LESS FOOD.  How the hell do stone aqueducts cost FOOD?  They're made of STONE, not meat!

And there's no real explanation as to what actually affects public order in any real way.  Whereas in previous games, you could see each individual settlement information, see how religion/culture penalties stacked up with unhappiness over high taxes, stacked up with squalor and/or boredom or unrest over having an army occupy them, and understand why the settlement is in turmoil, and MOST OF ALL, know exactly what to do to alleviate it.

For example, you could check a settlement to see that squalor was contributing to 80% of the unhappiness, and the tax burden contributing to 30% (leading to a -10% public order rate), you would know to build buildings that dealt with squalor to attack the big problem first.

In Rome 2, you're informed of the benefits and problems caused by taxes, culture, etcetera, even from high slave populations, but a whole other variable is left there as a general ""Who the Hell Knows"" in the form of ""Provincial Instability""

What causes it?  Who the hell knows.  In the aforementioned situation, Hellas was built up, and well-fed, with taxes at their absolute lowest settings.  Provincial Instability combined with the massive Squalor and plunged Hellas' public order down more and more every single turn, until it revolted and was quickly put down.  From there, Provincial Instability briefly disappeared.  Meanwhile, most of my armies were in Italy, and Italy was at full 100% public order, with NO provincial instability despite being recently conquered, and virtually identical to Hellas in terms of building diversity.

Again and again throughout the campaign, ""Provincial Instability"" strikes provinces entirely at random, with no explanation as to what is causing it.  I can be completely at peace, with three client states under me, and plenty of food coming in, very low taxes, and coffers bursting with tens of thousands of talents of gold, and suddenly a region will stop growing due to low public order and eventually revolt unless I send one of my armies to boost the Military Presence score.

Speaking of military, the new system seems to go straight to Marian-era private armies, where generals recruit soldiers directly.  You need them to be in a certain settlement with the right barracks or workshops to get the better quality units and weapons, but ultimately you can't train a small task force to just hang around without appointing a general to it, and you can't leave a full stack of versatile heavy infantry to defend a border town; garrisons are automatically deployed when attacked, and you need a general-led army in town to add to the defense.

The new Unit Cards are also horribly done.  In every previous game up until Shogun 2, they used mini screenshots of the actual video game unit, as it appears on the field.  In Shogun 2, they went for stylized drawings of the units, or stylized pictures resembling daguerreotype photographs for Fall of the Samurai.

The drawings here are so cheap and lazy, it's almost impossible to tell the difference between certain units.  If it weren't for the names popping up when you hover over them, you'd barely even be able to tell the difference between Hastati and Principes, Hoplites and Pikemen and Thorax Pikemen, Javelinmen and Slingers (?!), and so on.  At some point, you don't even bother recognizing the units by name or armor/weapons, but by broad shapes in the UIs---you know this is a ballista because it looks like a bow, you know this is a cavalry trooper because it has a horse-looking thing in it, you know this is a higher-level legionary because the helmet is shaped differently.

The UI as well is an utter mess that hides valuable information in slide-up tabs that appear when you click on settlements or armies, and which hides the Event Log in a decision I cannot even imagine making any sort of sense at all.  You have to manually open the event log most of the time, only to find that it is unevenly spaced with the rest of the UI, causing it to take up a huge part of the screen.

Then there's agents.  Much like Shogun 2, they charge money to do their jobs that you hire them for to begin with, and by and large they're mostly useless, meant either to assassinate one another or give minor bonuses to your own army.

The last major issue with the campaign is the factions system.  I've only played as Athens thus far, so I can't speak for how well it works with divided nations like Rome and Carthage.  Much like Rome Total War, you play as families (properly named now, House of Julia, Junia, Cornelia) which end up controlling the entirety of Rome, so there aren't multiple Roman factions on the map, which is good, I suppose, and better represents the coming civil war.

But what I don't understand for Athens at least is the whole point of having factions which are apparently hostile to one another, and to which I am actively a member of one, along with controlling the entire nation of Athens.

Basically, there are ""Oligarchs"" and ""Magistrates"".  I didn't get to choose, I was automatically made a Magistrate.  I had to suffer the Oligarchs trying to assassinate my own generals and family members, sometimes succeeding, and my having absolutely no control over their actions, save to try to do the same to them.

Except, like I said before, I CONTROL ALL OF ATHENS.  Meaning I can appoint Oligarch faction members to the heads of armies.  Even armies only 100 men strong.  I can then send that tiny army straight into the Sahara desert and wait until they die of attrition, or the Numidians get sufficiently enraged by my trespassing that they attack and kill them.  Literally nothing stops me from doing this because there is no repercussion, no benefit, no sense that this factionalism is even affecting my campaign at all beyond aggravating me by having experienced generals suddenly drop dead or get put out of action for 5 years, wounded from a botched assassination attempt.

Now, to the battles.

In true ""vanilla"" Total War style, they are fast, wild, and typically over quickly.  Completely out of the norm for Total War style, units now don't even bother to stay in formation when fighting, opting instead to go Hollywood-style one-man-army Drunken Titus Pullo Breaking Rank And Forcing Lucius Vorenus To Have Him Whipped For Disobeying And Assaulting Him.  The worst part is, the Hoplites actually have a Phalanx formation, and can move in phalanx formation.  Though if I order them to run, they will immediately break Phalanx formation.  So I try to keep them walking.  They STILL break phalanx formation as soon as they reach the enemy line.

I've already seen the term ""Blob"" used to describe these battles in Rome 2, where units simply pile on to each other, with seeming disregard for physics, into massive balls.  I haven't seen it happen frequently, though that may just be because enemy units tend to rout quickly, long before I can pile in enough troops to make a blob.

Literally no previous Total War game from Rome to Shogun 2 has been this bad in terms of unit spacing and formation.  In all those games, units maintained formation as much as their discipline and training allowed, and if soldiers were standing side by side, filling a small area with their bodies, you could not cram in MORE soldiers to stand next to them like you can in this game.

Winding down with one of the major complaints, graphics.  It looks pretty, though the decision on coloring seems to be odd, depending largely on lighting.  Compared to Shogun 2, soldiers are in bright, bold colors, sometimes incongruent, looking like a line of ketchup and mustard bottles for a Roman line.

As well, the campaign map is massive, and apparently more detailed than Shogun 2.  I only assume so because, while Shogun 2's campaign map runs smoothly on my high-powered computer all the time, Rome 2's campaign map is constantly refreshing textures when I move the map around.  I can center in on Greece, move over to Italy, have Italy's textures appear flat and pixelated and quickly rebuff to their high quality settings, then scroll back to Greece and have its textures appear flat and pixelated as well, before rebuffing to high quality.  Aside from this, everything runs smoothly and quickly.

Except for loading times.

Even basic, small-scale battles take twice as long to load up as battles did in Shogun 2, despite there being no noticeable difference in memory or graphical strain on my system, and the dreaded End Turn can take as long as 2 minutes, even early into the game.  It makes it impossible to become immersed in the campaign gameplay, as each turn wastes away, with bogged down End Turn times forcing you to either watch the computer units meander about aimlessly, or find something to distract you until it's your turn again.

Another review of the game by Rowan Kaiser from ArsTechnica perfectly sums up this experience:

""In most grand strategy games, the motivation to play ""just one more turn"" is the most appealing part. In Total War: Rome II, ""just one more turn"" is a threat.""

****PATCH 4 UPDATE****

I hadn't touched the game since October 6th, but boredom overcame, and so I looked to finish my grueling Athenian campaign, currently post-turn 300 because the victory conditions are obscenely long, and by which standards even the Roman Empire wouldn't reach (I currently control about as much land, if not more than Rome at its height, which consists of some 120 settlements, when I need 140 for victory.  Alternately, I need 90 settlements and 20 trade agreements for an economic victory, but GOOD LUCK GETTING 20 TRADE PARTNERS THIS LATE IN THE GAME).

Basically, the only changes I've noticed are cosmetic.  The biggest change from Patch 1 was that the End Turn time was sharply reduced, and loading times between battles or loading saves is similarly reduced.  Some icons were fixed, or expanded upon to provide better information, and naval units now have symbols representing their upgraded hulls.

Despite the reportedly hundreds of changes made, my earlier statement (and the title of my Civ5 review) still rings true for this game---shiny new expansions and patches can't fix a rotten foundation.

- If there were ANY improvements to AI, I haven't seen them yet, or I may have to start up a whole new campaign, because the Campaign AI is essentially DOA---literally no faction declares war on me, the player, and they are ALWAYS begging for money in exchange for meaningless Non-Aggression Pacts (meaningless because they never declare war on me anyway), or trade agreements they break off turns later due to losing their trading port, or a general hissy fit.  Similarly, they seem completely, blissfully ignorant of your or any other AI's movements.

It seemingly makes sense for the player character to not be able to see the entirety of the map right away (it would cause utter hell on End Turn times, as well), but a staple of the series has tended to be that AI would recognize when their borders were weak; it would build up armies or keep them close by to borders with other factions.  This is given even MORE opportunity in Rome 2 by allowing you to walk through other nations' lands without having to declare war or seek military access, though by doing so you anger the nation and risk provoking conflict.

But since the AI never declares war on you, you're free to squat 6 armies on top of an enemy city and watch as they mewl and do nothing.  They don't even bring up their own armies to try to passive-aggressively urge you to leave.  As such, if you're planning to take over every settlement owned by a faction, you can freely move your armies into position to blitz them within 1 turn, and the AI won't do a thing to stop you, or even pretend to be concerned.

Yet by the same (lack of) logic, the AI will break off trade agreements with you if they feel you're getting too rich or too close to economic victory.

- Battle AI.  I firmly believe that so long as those EFFing flags are there, the battle AI will remain fundamentally broken at the basest level.  In prior games, siege battles had a ""flag"" in the form of a town square, but the AI was seemingly more focused upon actually fighting out a battle---their main force would besiege, attack your defending forces, then if they had backup or reinforcements on the other side of the settlement, would slip in from the rear and take the town square WHILE KEEPING your forces occupied.

Instead in this game, practically the exact opposite happens; the force deployed to attack your defense forces will SIT and WAIT for their ""secret reserves"" to slip in and snatch the town square, allowing you full momentum to bring virtually your entire army to smash that backup force, then sit and wait for 50 minutes as the enemy besiegers stand there and wait for the now-destroyed force to steal the victory for them.  Most of the time, they will send a few siege engines to at least try to attack your forces, but if the first wave fails, they don't even bother trying again.  And this is a NEW PROBLEM---enemies would ALWAYS attack in siege battles for as long as they had siege equipment!  The battle would automatically end in victory for you if the enemy's siege towers and/or battering rams were set on fire and destroyed; it even encouraged the AI to build more ladders, since they could never be destroyed.

But since only settlement capitals have walls now, the vast majority of siege battles are essentially village defenses like in prior games where your settlement didn't even have a basic wooden palisade up.  Here, the enemy AI is entirely fixated on that EFFing flag.  Every single siege defense battle I have played, from day 1, to patch 4, has consisted of the enemy rushing ALL their troops forward against one of my lines, throwing ALL their infantry and cavalry into my units, IGNORING THEM, and trying to rush PAST them to get to my EFFing flag.  This has caused victories which saw my garrison forces of less than 1000 win heroic victories against enemy forces 4 and 5 times larger, simply because the enemy ran into my spears, and kept trying to run, rather than bothering to stop and fight.

All these factors coming together, combined with the release-day bugs, the reportedly 40% larger (than any prior TW game) budget, and the breath-taking arrogance from the marketing side, makes this whole game, even now more than a month after release and 4 patches adding up to hundreds of megabytes of more data, an unmitigated failure of game play design."
218,1,works great but really boring
219,1,"Sadly, this cable lasted only a couple of months before it stopped working completely.  It was always cared for and never abused, so this was a pretty big disappointment.

I would steer clear of this one.  Wish I would have paid the few extra bucks for the genuine Sony."
220,1,This product is not only crap but dangerous. I've had it 3 months and it broke. I woke up to a burning smell. It wasn't until later I realized it was coming from this. I went to charge my wiimote and it wasn't lit up like usual. After looking closer the plastic is melted on the bottom. I was lucky it didn't catch fire. Don't buy this unless you want to burn your house down. Additionally before it broke it wouldn't hold a charge for long at all
221,1,"The maker of this game has released an awful product.

Don't get me wrong. The game's content itself is very good, very engrossing and emotional.

But the game is a lemon. It has far beyond the typical glitches (freeze-ups, slowdown, etc.) that one may encounter with games; the game is ultimately unplayable.

There are all sorts of problems, such as being unable to play later episodes and losing one's game saves, which given the nature of this game, is enough to drive one crazy.

It takes a lot of time, devotion and emotional investment to get through what is otherwise a great, deep game. And to lose that all because the product itself is shoddy is beyond disappointing.

I highly suggest no one buy this game until they release a new version (one that works) or they iron out all the huge bugs. They released a patch recently, but it only worked temporarily.

Buyer beware..."
222,1,"This game is not worth buying. I'm not even sure if this game is worth renting. If you have played GTA San Andreas it is pretty much the same thing. It's a sequel so I guess it should be. There just aren't enough new things in this game to justify purchases.

If you have never a GTA, then you should rent it and see how the gameplay is. You pretty much drive from one location to the next and complete missions...kinda of boring missions too."
223,1,"THIS WAS A FUN GAME TO PLAY. WHEN IT WORKED. KEY WORD HERE IS WHEN.

ONLY PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A PC GAME, WAS IT OPERATES OFF ""ORACLE"" SERVER.
WHAT A DISASTER AND A SHAME. SEEMS THEY MARKETED THIS TOO EARLY FOR THE PC.
CUT CORNERS, WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
CONSTANT UPDATES WHEN YOU LAUNCH GAME.
GOT TO POINT ONE FRIDAY NIGHT THAT WORKING WITH THEIR TECH SUPPORT (FOR THE 3RD TIME)
I SAID THE HELL WITH THIS. WANT A REFUND.

EVEN THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE TECH SUPPORT LINE ADMITTED HE COULDNT PLAY THE GAME ON HIS PERSONAL COMPUTER. THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT FOR ME."
224,1,"Multiplayer seems broken, gameplay isn't that great. First payday is way better"
225,1,"EA, we are disappointed with your cynically manipulative approach to customers. SimCity was badly broken and you have told us repeatedly that you have no plans to fix it - that large cities, for instance, are impossible. Not only have your statements been misleading on a technical level but they also underscore the essential laziness that defines your approach to gaming. Cash farming is what EA does best, and Cities of Tomorrow perpetuates the long-standing tradition. Overpriced and without fixes to the core problems of the original, you're not getting much out of this.

You're paying EA to rent (not own) a copy of a badly broken game. You're paying to be constantly checked in upon to make sure you're not pirating or cheating or (worst of all) playing offline.

You can encourage this manipulation or you can go play something else. Your choice."
226,1,"I bought the Xbox version and was disappointed to see that the schedules are generated incorrectly after the first season. I bought the PS2 version -- same crap! How can you suckers out there possibly say Madden 05 is going to be dethroned? Are you complete idiots? Look morons, the NFC West plays the NFC South this season. In season two the NFC West should play the NFC East. In season three the NFC West should play the NFC North. IT NEVER HAPPENS!!! THE NFC WEST KEEPS PLAYING THE NFC SOUTH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!! That means counting the division opponets you get only six different opponets a season when you should get at least ten. ESPN knows much about presentation, but nothing about how NFL schedules work. The game is fun in year one, but after that all of you simulation fans will be gravely disappointed. If you're a moron who doesn't know any better this game is for you. There is no f! cking way in h! ll this game is better than Madden 05 and the beautiful thing about it is that I don't even have to play Madden 05 to know that (it isn't released yet). SEGA got $39.98 out of me so I guess I'm just as much of a sucker as the rest of you nitwits who write reviews before you thoroughly investigate a game. Just about all of this game's features are pointless -- the practice sessions that bring your stats down instead of up (so much for practice), the crib (dumb), the ""player of the game"" interviews (an endless cliche spewing machine). Soon you will be pressing the button to skip all of them to start the next game and shutting off the ""Weekly Preparation"" option. Dethrone Madden???? Yeah, right. SEGA can't even make a f! cking schedule right and that has been a problem with their football games since the Dreamcast. All of you out there will vote that this review didn't help you and even write counter reviews debating this issue. You've got to get the schedules right to be a serious contender. This game could've been, should've been, but it's never going to be. You can't polish a turd."
227,1,"Do not waste your hard waned money on this game.  I loved the series but Stronghold 3 is rotten.  First of all there is no skirmish mode, which basically means no replay value and no fun.  Second, the game is so filled with bugs that I could not list all of them here.  You will not be able to get thru one of the pre made games without batting it.  Just take my word and the word of all the others that wasted their money and buy a game that is fun."
228,1,"Ubisoft is now claiming that the game is simply NOT SUPPORTED ON LAPTOPS.  I Googled minimum specs before purchasing the game and no websites that I could find, including an official Ubisoft blog listing the specs, mention that the game is not supported on laptops.  This Amazon store, which Ubisoft owns, doesn't mention this either.  Now they tell me it's on the box (which you obviously don't get with an online code), and it's in some obscure FAQ that doesn't even appear in the first page of Google results when you Google ""Far Cry 4 specs.""  I've asked them for a refund, but what I just said about the box and FAQ...was their response.  So in my opinion this is consumer fraud, affecting virtually anyone who purchases this game for their laptop."
229,1,I was not to impressed with this game and I don't have it anymore. My friend I gave it to don't like it either.
230,1,"What is happening to COD's? First this felt nothing like a COD game other than it had a gun. It was more like a Halo game which I love Halo but still didn't like this game. First of all bring back couch co-op and NOT stupid Zombies or Aliens or whatever it is you're doing in waves now. I want the old school MW 2-3 couch co-op. I know most people play online, I don't. I have over 200 games in my xbox library and I don't play any online, which is why I haven't touched Titan Fall (which was a gift). I buy games if they have couch co-op or not (NOT this waves of enemies crap)."
231,1,"Game itself is 10/10.

BUT the game won't load at the 2nd level of the mall (otherworld). It gets to the pulsating loading screen, but won't load the next area. I've tried cleaning the cd and it still doesn't work.

Completely unsatisfied!"
232,1,Will NOT Work on windows 10!!!!! false ad!!!!
233,1,"Its a shame I'm bothering to mention a thing about the game.  Its garbage and its recycled garbage at that- the most economical kind (read as: exploitable kind for publishers).  The story is literally broken.  Everything ended after Bioshock presumably with you saving the little sisters or not- everyone is dead you survived- end of story.  Their is no reason to bridge a gap here, none at all.  I've heard rumors about the DRM on the PC version and being an owner of the first game (as well as system shock 1 for DOS and System shock 2) it irked me to some degree that an active connection was required to ""play"" the game I ""payed"" money to own.  Their is no logic here- I ""pay"" for services like cable because I do not own a server warehouse and am not my own internet provider.  So naturally if i buy a product made for a purpose (like a video game or movie) I now am the owner of said product period.  Why should their be the need to ""activate"" a product you've bought?  What if they started doing this with movies, e-books, and cd's?  What would be the general reaction to this?  Probably betrayal and after playing what I had already of Bioshock 2 on a friends PC I'm inclined to say that it was made to turn a buck or two.  Even worse is that its security methods are even more disturbing and riding the line somewhere between retail and digital distribution.  That's a dangerous place to be right now for us ""the consumer"" who can easily keep greedy men from getting paid at all.  Simply don't subscribe to the method and don't pay for the insult."
234,1,"Ive owned 4 of these Joy Sticks, they are good for a short while but have a problem after extensive use, and become useless after a while. Not recomended for Extensive continious use. The joy stick loosens and will not operate properly in FSX or combast Flight sim or online games. If you only play periodicaly then this is a good resonably priced joy stick. Ive never had one last more than 9 months from purchase."
235,1,"Ugh.  Ok. No gun physics.  Floaty.  Bring a 10 lb gun to bear like it's nothing.  Clear a ladder with no recovery. Jump from 15 feet with no recovery. The original Black Ops had touch.  The feel
of being in the game.  This feels like a weightless, soul less console game.  Actualy, feels alot like the original Wolfenstein.  Like a game for 12 year olds.  And maybe I'm wrong, but isn't
that what we have the Halo series for(sorry Halo fans, cool story, bad game)?  And if that is what you are looking for, why didn't you just buy Halo?  On an XBoX.  Why waste your money on this
crappy console port?  Why does a 2012 game look only slightly better than SEGA Virtua Cop on my 2012 dual video card Quad Core PC?  Sadly some artists probably poured their hearts and souls into

236,1,"They get in the way of the screen, and they show very little light.

I recommend getting a Micro, SP, a GameBoy Light(doesn't work for GBA games), a DS(only GBA games), or just playing in light."
237,1,"This is a perfect example of expectations not aligning with reality. Our family purchased an Xbox 360 (our first console) a couple years ago for our sons (now ages 10 and 8). We have the Kinect but we've never played a game that required its own controller, much less one shaped like a hunting rifle.

My expectation: I was hoping for a hunting simulation that I could use to gauge my sons' interest in deer hunting and, more importantly, enrollment in a hunter's safety course. I thought the game would teach the importance of patience (don't take the shot until you're ready) and the value of stealth (be quiet, you'll scare them away).

The reality: Packs/herds/groups of animals relentlessly charged at the screen with claws and fangs bared. Our mission was to slaughter as many animals as quickly as possible, so quickly in fact that we the gameplay never stopped to see whether any single hit was a kill shot.

The only key difference we could tell between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cabela-s-Dangerous-Hunts-2013/dp/B008HHTEXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013</a>&nbsp;and shooting games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-4/dp/B0050SYX8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 4</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-II/dp/B007XVTR3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty: Black Ops II</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-6/dp/B0050SY4DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 6</a>&nbsp;is that the mercenaries, soldiers, aliens and zombies are replaced by animals, albeit animals that aren't carrying automatic weapons, missile launchers or hand grenades.

The technical points:
* The all-new Top Shot Fearmaster tracks your heart rate, adjusting the game conditions and environment accordingly.
* The Top Shot Fearmaster intermittently loses its sync and either lags or misses the shot.
* The decorative sight serves only as a reminder of how a real rifle should be used and treated with respect.
* The two-player mode (all-new split screen Maneater mode) wasn't nearly as much fun as other two-player games with a split screen (both Halo 4 and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minecraft/dp/B00BU3ZLJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;come to mind.)

In summary, it was not love at first sight. While the two-brothers storyline sounded appealing on the back of the game box, the gameplay itself was not what we expected or enjoyed.

Rating: One star.

238,1,"I purchased this game used for less than ten dollars and I paid way too much.

As other people have said, it is short.  Actually, this is a godsend.  Had it been a full length game, the drag factor would have been incredible.  I quit after the standing stones.

My son, on the other hand, has battled into the Sixth Sorrow and discovered (to his own sorrow) that whatever it takes to unlock those four stomping manikins is not worth the effort.  If they pound on the floor often enough, does it break and let you through?

At any rate...  this is a flusher, or a gift for an enemy."
239,1,"I don't know why this is even still available for purchase on this site, because the game was cancelled and all servers shut down -2 years ago- in 2009. This product is nothing more than a $30 box.
If you'll look, you'll notice the last review was in 2005."
240,1,I am on beginner and get my butt kicked. The AI stamina hardly moves yet mine drops to nothing after 3 swings. I REALLY am disappointed. The controls are by far the hardest to use than any fighting game I have ever played. Can't imagine if I played on expert!
241,1,Not Good
242,1,"* Not worth new-release cost!
* Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players.
* Online manual just says ""Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand..."", nothing on how to actually join the game.
* After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in.
* Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. Likely normal. sad. Should be a way to register the game and run the install without the disc.
* Co-op mode is terrible. It should be called something else. It is really just a single player game. If the 2nd player joins and dies. They do not automatically re-spawn, they have to wait for a timer to expire and then press a button to return.
* Camera only follows player 1 and if player 2 goes off the screen, they time out and die. If player 1 dies and player 2 is still alive, it doesn't matter. It acts like both had died and forces you back to a check point.
* For a Sony launch title, the graphics are NOT good. Feels like an older PS3 game.
* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn't good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it's one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it's just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney's Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it's better than Knack.

My pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.

IGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!

If you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.

Remember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it's a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn't good enough for a $60 new-release cost.

UPDATE: I still can't stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it's a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It's not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it's release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.

Many people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that. As my title says, this review is based heavily on the Co-op aspect of the game."
243,1,"Normally I wouldn't write a review for games but destiny was so bad I didn't want other people wasting their hard earned cash

Not everybody knows that:
You cannot play this offline
You need a constant connection to the destiny servers which is very unreliable get ready for your game to be interrupted even with a good connection.
You need to reach level 5 before you can do multiplayer.
This is not a proper mmo like eve online
You will need over 5 gig left on your harddrive to play.
Despite all the hype prepares to be underwhelmed both by the lack of depth of the story or any real action do not believe the trailers.

This is not open world or sandbox there's nothing to explore you go on these dull missions kill someone then go back to the tower.
Also the story ends at the introduction and only gets mentioned every now and again

Story
I really wanted this to be good but alas it's just not worth your time an empty lonely game experience with a story that could have been amazing. If you're a story driven person I'm afraid like many online only games the main story just becomes a back story it's so sad.

Action
Also if you're not into level grinding then you may want to give this a miss as the enemy have main spawn points which they don't go out of and not long after killing all the enemy they will spawn back again.
The a.i's are not as intelligent as those used in say killzone or halo (throw a grenade at an elite he will try and commando roll out of the way not stand there like a moron)all in all they enemy are not fun to fight but pretty boring. The only interesting action comes from multiplayer but with that many better multiplayers' out there and more coming out again you'd better spend your money elsewhere.

Levels
As I mentioned the levels have nothing to explore in them if you're expecting something like skyrim or fallout 3 with a living world populated by interesting events, locations and npc's prepare to be shocked.
Take earth for instance you will have to keep going back to the same location for all of the missions so in real terms destiny is actually very small but this is the same for the other locations off planet.

Conclusion
At first glance it really seem's good but after a few hours play and then a few more you realize there is not actually a lot there in terms of story characters or action.
Don't get me wrong I love bungie but I just don't know where it went all wrong.(although from what I understand some of bungie went to 343 industries to look after halo maybe that's where all the talent went)

If you want something like this but better play borderlands or Dead Island a lot more fun and you can play it offline.

If you're really desperate wait until it's in the bargain bucket then you won't be so wounded by the money you have just wasted."
244,1,"I bought one of these three weeks ago.  Keep note I did not install Saitek's drivers; satisfied that Windows' and Linux's built-in drivers would suffice, as the backlit nature of the keyboard makes typing in the dark easier...

Eventually the ""n"" and ""m"" keys lost sensitivity, and I had to hit the bloody things hard to get the OS (Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit or Ubuntu Linux 8.10 64-bit) to recognize tje keystrokes.  ""n"" was far worse.

So, fair enough.  I exchanged it for a second one.  Unfortunately, after two HOURS of use, I've already had TWO occasions where the ""h"", quote, and right shift key stopped responding -- but started to work again after several minutes of... doing nothing.  How did I test this?  When seeing the ""h"" key wasn't doing squat, I held the key down.  There was a stammering delay between the ""hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""'s.  Sometimes by a factor of seconds.  Adjacent keys ""j"" and ""l"" worked perfectly despite the hang-up with the ""h"".  The most pathetic part is, this new problem didn't happen with the original keyboard.

Having read other reviews, it sounds like the sticking problem AND the non-responsive problems are quite common.  And these people have system specs ranging from older Pentium 4's to the newest i7s.  (Mine is an Intel Q9650 system with 8GB of RAM, running 64-bit Vista and Linux.)

Do not waste your money.

It isn't worth 80 cents."
245,1,"Horn-mad!  For the longest time I couldn't get this game to run -- and couldn't get my money back.

Unbelievably, it insists that you have a constant internet connection the entire time you're playing it . . . even on single-player mode.  If the connection is lost, THE GAME WILL STOP -- even if you're in mid-battle!  I couldn't effin' believe it!  This is a game only for those who have super-stable high-speed internet connections.

But here was my real problem:  although I have a high-speed internet connection, it's through a proxy.  This is a common situation for people connecting in businesses, apartment complexes, government buildings, etc.

INCREDIBLY, the game does not have proxy support!  Or, at least, not all of it does:  TIBERIAN TWILIGHT will take your proxy settings from your default browser to update and register the game, but once it starts, THAT PART -- at least as of my writing -- has not been coded to route through the proxy.  It's possible this will be fixed with a patch in the future, but in the meantime what this means is that before you can get to the menu, it'll say ""unexpectedly disconnected from the internet.""  That's misleading:  what it really should say is that the part of the game that checks for the constant internet connection can only detect a direct connection.

If you have this problem and are bent on playing this game, what you need to do is get a program (""Proxifier"" is one example) that forces applications to recognize the proxy and connect through it.  Using this program, I was able to get TIBERIAN TWILIGHT as well as RED ALERT (another EA outing with a very similar problem) working.

But I have to say:  those programmers at EA are a boatload of 'tards for not coding proxy support into their games!"
246,1,"To sell this game and make permanently captive any player (after payment of a 60-80 dollar fee) is unconscionable. The game can only be played while you tie up your modem continuously during play -- to their server. And the game itself is a joke. I have been playing SimCity from its first version many years ago and have never seen a version so blatanly fraudulent as this new SimCity Limited Edition.

If you do not like this abomination (and I am sure you agree) make sure you get your money back. I have returned my copy to Amazon and so far, have not had any problem with getting a credit. To protect their customers, I urge Amazon to immediately stop the selling of this version of SimCity. On the other hand, the older SimCity 4 is a very good game and keeps most players involved far beyond their expectations.

This ""game"" should be called ""EA MoneyCity"" because its only value seems to be the not-so-well-disguised effort by the publisher EA to separate us from our hard earned dollars in a number of sly ways.

If you want detailed information about this ""scam,"" please read some of the other reviews."
247,1,Thanks for charging us an arm and a leg for something that should be included.
248,1,"This is the first sign of decline for Bioware. It only gets worse from here. Don't buy a game that continuously recycles the same environments over and over. A game that promises that your decisions matter leads you to 1 of 2 decisions regardless of your choices. If you accept junk, EA and Bioware will keep selling you junk. Casey Hudson and Mac Waters have destroyed this company."
249,1,"I've been a big fan of most of EA Sport's titles throughout the years and this one is a huge disappointment. I love their new NHL hockey and the NCAA football, but his game's quality is questionable at best. In last year's version the had great graphics and good gameplay . . . but only half the cars on the track; a concern for some. I thought it to be entertaining. This year, at the expense of gameplay and graphics, they have a full pack of cars. But the end result is terrible. Inacurate handling of the cars and chippy (at best) game rate where the grandstands click by as if is was a PS one game. I owned it for two days trying to find some worth in it but, alas, could find no redeeming qualities in it and I sold it to someone who has a PS2 but no TV . . . the best way to enjoy it if you want to own it."
250,1,"I'm very disappointed with this wireless adapter.  I purchased this 6 months ago for my son's Xbox 360.  He has been complaining for at least 3 months about being kicked off live or just a poor connection.  Now it has completely quit working.  Thankfully I saved the old cord he had used previously to connect.  Its a shame this cannot not be returned, its a complete waste of money."
251,1,"Let me first say that I loved the NBA2k Series. I think NBA2k12 is one of the best sports games ever made. That's why it's so frustrating to play this game. When I first got the game, I put it in expecting to get a quick game or two in.... however, 2k had other ideas as it took almost 45 minutes to install. By that time, I had switched to the 360 while it installed.

A few days later, I finally got around to playing the game. I started with GM mode only to find features that were present in previous games were now taken away. I couldn't force trades if the computer was being ridiculous. Also, I set it up for a 21 game season with injuries off only to find I was set up with an 82 game season and Russell Westbrook got injured in the first week of playing. Awesome.

Now, fast forward to today. I want to play my franchise, but I can't connect to the 2k servers (my internet is working fine because I'm able to stream mlb.tv) so I'm stuck with a game I can't play.

I'm giving it two stars because it's fun when it works, but I can't begin to express how disappointing this game is and how far 2K Sports has fallen. I would not advise anyone to buy this game and instead wait until next year or buy on another system, because this game is a complete waste on the XBox One.

Update: 4/29. 2K servers are down again so I'm left with a game I paid full price that I can't play. I'm forced to take my review down to 1 star because this happens at least once or twice a week. Please Please Please do not buy this game. It's a lemon."
252,1,"Over 100 hours of gameplay (5% completeion, LOL!) and I'm STILL barley learning how to use the mega-bloated, super-complex controls. I've been stumbling through mission after mission (they're all virtually identical) and it's becoming clear, it's just the same stuff repeated over and over and over again. Sadly, it has become so repetive and pointless, I just don't care to play it anymore.

Get dropped a mile away from the enemy base and go in and rescue or excute someone... rinse and repeat. That's it -- really. Oh yea; build up your base for no reason, whatsoever. Almost forgot that part (for some reason). Wait, maybe it's because the only room I can enter on my giant ""megabase"" is the toilet! I'M NOT JOKING!!! LOL!

The ""plot"" (LOL) is so disjointed and out of touch with reality, it couldn't suspend the disbelief of a 7 year old. The ""story"" (I don't even feel comfortable calling it that) really ads nothing to the MG saga, and is just yet another useless ad on. There is a pointless cut scene for EVERYTHING and the credits role whenever you complete the simplest mission. And no, you uselly can't skip it so you have to watch them over and over and over... and over....

Phantom Pain (in the A$$) really is just a demo with every useless gimick imaginable piled onto it. As far as ""online mode"", yea you guessed it... crickets. It's totally abandoned (from what I hear, it never did work... at all).

With all of the hype this title has received, I though it would at least be ""good"". It's not even average. There is NO WAY ON EARTH this game got a 4.5/5 from ANYBODY who actually played it and gave it a fair review. I even know half a dozen MG fanboys who either hate it or just didn't care for it. I don't know anyone who loved it or even thought it was a worthy entry on any level. Why would such a ""great"" game already be given away for FREE on PS+? Most all of the raving reviews for this one are TOTALLY FAKE. When you see the production cost for titles like this (millions alone are spent for advertisment and ""hype"" aka fake rewiews), it's pretty clear they have a team of monkeys sending out a lot of false praise for garbage games like this.

So if you like spending your time learning how to use a controler just in time to be bored out of your mind for a game that has a useless plot and ads nada to the franchise; THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! If not, skip it and play something else... pretty much ANYTHING else."
253,1,Bought one pair and they made the controller feel so much better that I bought another pair for my second controller. Not even 3 months have passed and they are developing a horrendous stink. I had to remove them both yesterday. These are definitely not a long term solution for a better grip on your controller. I would not recommend them. The foam material absorbs sweat.
254,1,"It downloaded and installed great, but during the registering process it fails to register my account. It gives me ""Can't Verify Email"", which is BS, it's the same email address I use with amazon. I guess it is true what they say, ""You get what you paid for""."
255,1,"Back in 2008, I had a choice of the XBOX 360 or the PS3. Being a big Playstation fan, among other reasons, I chose the PS3.  Now, 4 years and 8 1/2 months later, the PS3 has died!  Sony has been on the decline with their games and their systems lately.  I have not played my PS3 much anymore due to the lack of games.  Instead, I used it for Blu Ray, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant Video.  So, even when the game selections stopped barreling through and Playstation Network got hacked, I still had good use for the system.  Now, I have a brick.  Thank God I bought an XBOX in 2011 and I have been much more satisfied with XBOX Live and the games.  PC games are still quite superior to any console, but still too slow to depend on for constant play.  On top of the system dying, anything I had from the Playstation Store/Network is now gone and unaccessible.  This is a huge downside to using consoles to purchase digital only content.  I guess you just roll the dice, play the game as quick as you can to reach the end and hope you can go back later to play.  At this time, I will not replace my PS3 and I have no plans to get the new console from Sony after they announce and release it.  I will have to see if Microsoft's hardware can deliver better than Sony.  If not, then I guess there is no hope for consoles lasting long anymore.  I sure feel that $400.00 for a system would have given more than 5 years of service."
256,1,not kid appropriate
257,1,"wow this game is bad. I have yet to find a single thing i like in it. So much potential wasted. The PC version looks absolutely horrible and still can barely run at 60fps. Shadows look like crap. Reflections even worse. The weather transitions are horrible. The time changes are bad. Driving is the worst our of any game I have ever seen. I mean wow... what a let down. This should not even be mafia related. The missions are boring and all too similar. The controls are not well thought out. The list just goes on and on... I have not been a fan of 2k games in a long time, especially after the way they ruined NBA games, and now they ruined mafia. Save your money, even if you are on a console, this game is terrible."
258,1,I am a big halo fan . I ordered  it for my xbox and it didn't  work it also had a cracked in the center  of the disk.
259,1,"I have played MMORPG games (EQ1, EQ2, WOW, Vanguard, COH) for years and was actually enjoying AOG until I hit nude NPC characters.
Pros: Fun but somewhat repetitive game play

Cons:
No chat filters
Cut movies or interactions with NPC had a lot of swearing
Nudity of NPC

I overlooked the cussing (both NPC and players), crass building names and how the game allowed every idoit to create characters with vile names but I couldn't continue to play the game once I hit the nudity. Shame on the makes for not giving me the option to filter it out. I turned off OOC chat to limit my exposure to morons, but the NPC language couldn't be filtered out.
 Yes it is a M17 game, but the developers need to give me the right to choose what I want to see/hear and what I don't. I am over 30 years old and have no desire to see topless women in a video game. If they want my money, they need to give me the tools I need to have an enjoyable experience. Instead, I am leaving this game with a foul taste in my mouth. I hope my friends will follow but even if they don't, I have to make a stand for my morals somewhere.
Save your money and look for a better game elsewhere. This game is trash."
260,1,"This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the gameplay is a total bore.

There are two main gameplay styles: ""investigation"" and ""trial"". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC.

The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual gameplay. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.

Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text."
261,1,"I had heard great things about this series and how scary they were, and what a great storyline the Silent Hill series has.  Unfortunately I will never know because I uninstalled it after about 5 hours of ""gameplay.""

I have been playing computer games for 25 years of all types, from Zork, to King's Quest, to FPS games, and without a doubt, this game has the worst movement controls and combat system I've ever seen.  It is incredibly awkward to move, mainly because of the camera angles, which continually change direction. Sometimes the camera will be in front of you facing the character (almost always a terrible position if combat is involved), and sometimes it will switch to a bird's eye view and you wil be staring at the character's head.  Combat is awkward too due to the camera angles.  It's difficult to target certain monsters, and some you won't even know are there until they're right on top of you when the camera is faced forwards.  This just not make for a ""Scary"" gameplay experience, just frustrating.  I hate dying to what appears to be a very easy monster because the camera angle won't easily shift to it.  When the camera is in first person view, response time of the mouse is not very quick (you can't change this, even with your mouse), and trying to use the ""look"" cursor to view objects takes way too long.

In addition to this, the game is slow.  You can run, but combat moves are about half as slow as traditional games (even adventure ones).  And if you die, prepare to have to go through a lot of trouble to get back to your resume point, including having to go through the same cinematic sequences, since the game has very inopportune save points.

I won't be going back to the Silent Hill series without playing a demo of future games first.  This game almost would have been much better as an adventure game instead of an action game.  I'd rather watch the cinematic sequences and try to figure out puzzles than spend my entire time just trying to move around and fight."
262,1,"Boo EA. After their train wreck of a launch of Simcity, they have the nerve to charge 10 bucks... for an amusement park...

I would feel less robbed if they would have used a gun and a mask. It's rare to feel this ripped off about a video game purchase, but that EA managed to instill.

Pass on this, if you haven't bought Simcity, good on you, I wish that I had not."
263,1,doesn't work
264,1,"I've had nothing but problems with this upgrade when combined with the Nunchuk.  I'm at a loss here....  The games in the Sports Resort look like they could be fun, if only we could play them.

I have four controllers, and four motion plus add-ons, and three nunchuks.  (Obviously this limits us to three people for games that require the Nunchuk, which is fine.)  The problem is that only one of my Nunchuks works with the Motion Plus.  The other two work okay without the Motion Plus, and the Motion Pluses all work okay without the Nunchuks.  Combine them though, and only one works.  No good at all for three kids.  I've tried moving around the Motion Plus and Nunchuks, and it's very consistent.  The only Nunchuk that works correctly with the MotionPlus is the one that came with the game unit."
265,1,Unfinished even for a early access.  Been early access already too long and no real head way.  Even an expansion is out and they have not fixed performance issues even on fast systems.
266,1,Another crappy product. You have to go through a thing called: The STEAM Network. The STEAM 'loader' installs easy but the game cannot be accessed. No response from customer support. A waste of time and money. Do NOT buy this POS!
267,1,"This is a TERRIBLE game.  The controls are clunky at best.  The graphics are poor.  And worst of all items just spontaneously disappear from where you've set them -- and in many instances, you have to set them in the places  from which they disappear.  For instance, you may have to place a propane bottle next to an object and blow it up.  Take a few steps away, turn around, the bottle is gone.  Unless you love self torture, do not waste your time or money on this piece of trash."
268,1,"I'm one for keeping reviews short, so here goes. Story and characters weren't interesting, at all. Gameplay is the same as previous entries, but clumsier. Glitches all over the place, from people disappearing as you approach them to carriages spinning wildly out of control in a circle around you. Way too much time devoted to linear tutorial, not enough variety or ""fun."" I loved AC1&2, but this one brings over nothing that made those games great. Very disappointing. I would say spending more time polishing would be a step up, but the gameplay, story, and overall feel of this game is such a drag that the added polish would be only a marginal improvement. Too bad."
269,1,Only fun if you are 6 years old or less. Extremely tedious and repetitive.
270,1,"I've bought all of the other Sims games, and they have worked just fine.  I install this one, and all of a sudden everything freezes, and the game is crashing.  I was hoping the new patch would fix it, but now it's acting worse! I tried contacting EA games support, and they haven't responded.  My problem is not unique, there are tons of other people out there who have the same problem... and so far there isn't a solution :("
271,1,"Just go play warframe.
Know that you are buying a glorified time waster. It's a very small part of a game from jump and must put in around another 100 bucks to feel like you got any level of story."
272,1,Dogs*** on the PC - i should have never bothered.
273,1,"I always loved the orginal Zoo tycoon on the computer. So when I saw Zoo Tycoon 2 on the DS, I picked up a copy thinking I could have the same amount of fun, only portable. I was wrong. The game is nothing like the original. It's much simpler, and you can't really build impressive zoos. In the orginal game, you hire workers to care for the animals. You can still do that in the DS game, but I still found myself trying to care for the animals. And by care, I mean play annoying little minigames. You're options are severly limited in this version. You can't  build large, good looking areas for guests to sit and eat. There's only a couple buildings you can build, and even with research, there's not that much to build. And it's not even worth it to make buildings anyway. In the orginal Zoo tycoon, it was easy to make several buildings, and they would all generate a lot of profits. In this game, no one even bothers. THe upkeep is almost always more than the money earned. So it's a loss. My finalm complaint is the size. You're only allowed 30 animals, and there's very little space. I filled up over half my zoo with 5 exhibits.

This game seemed to have so much potential. The first Tycoon games were great. But, you can do a lot more in that game, even though it was made several years ago. Even the graphics in the sequel didn't come close to the original. This version was so downgraded, it lost what made the game fun.

If you remember the older games and loved them, keep playing those, this game just can't compare."
274,1,"I am not a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I like it and this game feels like a pale impression of that series. Saints Row worked for the simple fact it didn't take itself seriously and was about fun. So it had a certain charm about it and felt completely different than the Grand Theft Auto series. Mafia 3 I really wanted to love but in the end it feels like Wal-Mart brand Grand Theft Auto because it takes itself too seriously and the execution of the graphics, gameplay and mission don't match. Not to mention the bugs. Consoles have issues sure, but on PC the game crashes wildly and is unplayable at times.

The story itself is good if you can make it past the forgettable and boring gameplay. Not to mention the bugs and crashes depending on which version you own. This game had a great idea behind it, and if it had been crafted by another studio perhaps something really special here but it is a swing and a miss for Take 2 Interactive.

Imagine going to George R.R. Martin and him saying, ""I want a fan fiction author to finish my series, who can't afford professional editing."" That is the experience we get with Mafia III, a great concept for a story trapped behind a lack of professionalism, and execution. I thought about giving this game 3 stars on console but for PC the game doesn't even run. A future fix doesn't change the fact people who paid for the game got one that didn't even work at times.

Pros
- Story if you can make it through the host of technical issues (on PC you pretty much can't)
- Soundtrack

Cons
- Graphics
- Performance
- Bugs
- Boring mission system
- Bad execution
- wasted potential.

Grade: F for PC

Mafia 3 had potential to be a sleeper hit of the year, but Take 2 Interactive forgot to handle the technical elements and implement interesting gameplay and missions. I guess wait for a steam sale in the future, if you can get it for under 10 bucks could be worth it if they fix the issues with the game."
275,1,"Don't get me wrong, BioShock is an amazing game, I absolutely love it, but it installs SecuROM on your computer which is NOT a good thing and it limits the amount of times you can install the game until it's a paperweight. I was very disappointed to disover that BioShock installed SecuROM on my PC, if you have an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 buy it for one of those... but not PC.
BioShock is a deep and rich game that will keep you immersed in its strange underwater fantasy world for hours at a time. You never know what is going to happen next and strange noises lurk around every corner of the city of Rapture. If you are looking for a thrilling first person shooter to occupy a bit of your time this would be the game to buy. 9/10."
276,1,Garbage. Lasted about a month before just randomly deciding to not work any longer. Buy a VGA box instead.
277,1,"-camping, camping everywhere
-spawns are terrible, I'm being shot BEFORE I EVEN MOVE
-Maps are too big
-customization/perks are confusing

This is one of the worst games I've ever played.  This is not fun"
278,1,"I played this game for close to 200 hours in a failed attempt to get some fun out of it.  Yes, you're going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it, but no I didn't.  I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive.  700 days played in World of Warcraft.  Thousands of hours played in D2.  Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.

I believed in Blizzard Entertainment.  I really, really did.  From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.  Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story.  Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot.  Sounds pretty stupid right?  It is trust me.  What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share?  You get nothing.  Fun huh?  So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money.  This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level.  Pure fail Blizzard!  Pure fail!

Then there are issues with the game's difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom.  They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died.  They said the game was crap and quit.  The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through.  So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die.  If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.

Last point I want to touch on is that the game's end game is nonexistent.  As in it's hard not because it's fun, but because it cheeses you into death.  I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear.  Then you can last for 3 hits!  So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house.  So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs.  You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear.  Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold.  The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money.  So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person.  But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over.  Sounds like fun huh?  Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun?

I also want to mention that the game lags like no other.  Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs, invisible attacks, melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen, etc.  And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it's gear.  That makes the game even more fun with lag!

Game is terrible.  Leave it in the store.  Do not buy.  It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno.  The story is terrible.  The gear drops don't exist for you.  The auction house is the best place to level up.  And the real money auction house has the best gear.

Enough said.  :)"
279,1,"After activating my new steam account, I tried to install it and it crashed at 99%. Be careful when you buy a PC game on disc. It wasn't steam's fault, because I have installed other games on there that work just fine."
280,1,Price matched it at Walmart. Looks cool and all but functionality isn't there. Can't hear other people very good and friends said they also couldn't hear me as well.
281,1,"This is how it is:

I would potentially rate the game if I could play it. Since I purchased it used, it was already activated to a Steam account. The Steam account is required to install the game. I tried to get Steam to transfer the CD Key to my already present account but was told no. Here is Steam's lame response:
""
Unfortunately, used CD Keys (whether resold or given by an individual or a store selling used goods) cannot be reset.

Please see the Steam Subscriber Agreement and the CD Key Reset Process FAQ if you would like more information:""

You can spend all day going through their agreements but nowhere does it say that the game is a rental and all your rights are null and void even if you have the game CD (not burned or duplicated), game case, game manual, sales insert, jewel case cover and invoice for sale.

Had I known it was a rental (you never can really own this game) I would have waited until it reached rental prices of $[...] and played it for my allotted 3 days...

Extreme disappointment since the first three installments were outstanding and now I have to deal with a game I purchased that won't play. Steam & Valve Co.'s need to get their act together before everyone bands together and stops buying their crap. SecureROM seems like open source compared to these vultures.

DON'T BUY ANY USED VERSION! IT WILL NOT PLAY... EVER!!!!"
282,1,"I will score this game 1 star to give a signal to the publisher that I do not accept their DRM.

Right now the game goes for $5 and it's in the 2011 bestseller list where I can apply one of the $5 discounts I got for buying games in the winter holiday sale, so, I could effectively get this game for free but I won't because of the DRM.

Appeal to publishers: please find alternatives to limiting the number of installs and if you can't then at least provide an official patch that removes the DRM a month or two after the release (like Witcher2 did), after all, you mostly care about the first weeks sales to not be a victim of piracy. It is completely unacceptable to have one or more year old games that still enforce this kind of DRM. Thank you!"
283,1,"DO NOT THINK ABOUT BUYING IT!! EA is fooling around with PC gamers. It's time we teach them a lesson. I'm trying to get my refund and I'm gonna get it back. Can really enjoy the game even with a powerful PC. What's the point? STAY AWAY FROM EA PC GAMES, there is a reason why Steam is successful. I didn't even want to give that game a star."
284,1,"7/27/11 -- Have played about a third of it multiple times.  Even after you install it (Windows 7 system) and let it spend an hour and a half downloading all the fixes, the game is so buggy it's frustrating as heck to play.  DON'T apply the second CD/DVD thinking that will help -- I ended up in an area that I literally could not get out of.  I uninstalled and started all over *again* with just the NWN2 portion of the game.  Gameplay itself would be good, if it worked consistently.  The storyline is ok; I could do without the cut scenes.  You can cut some of them short by clicking the mouse, but you run into the risk of inadvertently hitting a choice on a multiple choice menu that you didn't realize was coming up.  Sometimes the characters won't follow the leader.  Sometimes the characters won't attack even when you tell them to.  I'm just finding it incredibly poorly implemented.  (There's one character I ""save"" only to find him again needing to be saved -- and he doesn't remember our earlier encounter.)  I have no idea what further issues are in store for me.  I really cannot recommend this purchase unless you're willing to fight the gameplay as well as the creatures in the game itself."
285,1,"I didn't even bother returning it!  First off you can ONLY play an 'exhibition game' otherwise you have to purchase a PlayStation Plus membership to enjoy franchise mode and everything else.  This made me really upset!  You cant just download the updates and start a season or build a team with out being forced to pay first.  I refuse to ever pay to play a game!  The game play is very difficult!!  I put the AI on rookie level and I kid you not it is IMPOSSIBLE to run against the computer!!!  This will frustrate the hell out of you!!  I can pass no problem but forget about trying to run.  Add freezes, glitching and slow loading and this game is all hype and pretty much garbage!!  I will stick to older,  less complicated Madden games on my ps3 until major improvements are made on future Madden games coming out.  Madden has become a money hungry football franchise,  I wish their was another NFL series besides Madden for the ps4.  Sucks"
286,1,was everything described it would be
287,1,"If you were unsure if the acquisition of bioware by EA would affect the quality of game they put out, here's your answer. I have played bioware games since KOTOR and have yet to see them put out a such a steaming, bug filled pile as this. If you told me that the extent of their testing this game was one quick play through by some random junkie, who had never played an RPG, and was stoned out of his mind the whole time, I'd believe you. There is a glitch where the player character's attack speed gets progressively slower and slower. Thus turning fast paced button slapping action into an unbearably dull and exceedingly frustrating affair. I hear that this glitch is made worse by being a mage, which I was. I had to replay hours of the game to undo the slowdown only for it crop back up over and over until I gave in. My friend who has this game as well was a mage and was unable to avoid the glitch. He ended up selling the game without finishing it. It is said that you can slow down so much that your character will no longer attack at all. *<*< THIS GLITCH IS CONFIRMED ON ALL PLATFORMS! IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO UPDATE THE GAME VIA BROADBAND INTERNET, I WOULDN'T BOTHER BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING 20 HOURS INTO A GAME ONLY TO HAVE IT RUINED BY A GLITCH. EVEN IF YOU DO I'D WAIT TILL THEY PUT OUT A PATCH<*<*  You can read more on the details of this else where on the Internet. Also there is a vertical stretch on the sprites during the cut-scenes that flickers on and off randomly. Once more the kind of thing that testing easily reveal. There's a lot of other glitches I won't get into. All the major review sites don't seem to mention the game breaking slow glitch but, hell screw the hand that feeds you, just take there $60 and give them a turd. I could talk about the lack of central plot or the fact that you can just barely read the text without an HDTV(20/20 vision, with 46"" TV) or the obscured fashion side quests are presented (how fun to go into the start menu over and over) but, their obvious lack of adequate testing is obtusely more present in my experience of this game. Thanks for a game that left me pissed off enough to waste more time writing this review."
288,1,Not sure I can pinpoint why but this game is boring. I don't like jumping through stupid hoops solving problems that can't be figured out without a walkthrough.
289,1,Who the f*** would buy this xbox one for a high price. Whoever selling this is a total rip off
290,1,"This game stinks on all 3 systems (4 if you count GBA). There is more jumping around than fighting. And the fighting is just punching. So the whole game is jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, punch, punch, punch, jump, jump, etc. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
291,1,"Let me get the positives out of the way first. It's small, doesn't require an outlet to charge like most other chargers, can charge two at one time, has a light on the front to indicate it's charging, and is totally wireless. The two chargers on the back are also a huge plus.
There's really only one big negative, and it has to be that I always feel like it's going to break. It feels cheaply made, its constantly getting knocked off center by my cats, me, my dogs tails, anything. I feel like the USB ports are going to snap off inside. It just feels flimsy. I can't complain too much as I only paid about $7, but iafter only a few hours of using it, all I can think about is how the USB ports are going to break. The charging ports aren't very deep either and something is constantly bumping my controller off the charging station. My cats like to lay near/on top of my PlayStation because it's so warm so that's why they're always hitting it.
If you have an entertainment center and your PS4 is behind a door or you don't have animals, I'd totally recommend it, otherwise I'd pass.

Edited to change rating from 3 stars to 1: after not even two days, the USB port broke off in my PS4. I tried to unplug it since I wasn't using it and the left USB plug(if you're looking at the PlayStation) was still plugged in. Horribly cheap and I'll be buying a different charger"
292,1,"A dusty, dirty controller shoved haphazardly and unsecured into an opened retail box (upsode down AND backwards) cobered in dust and dirt. On top of that, increibly slow shipping and handling. Shell out the extra $5 and get yourself a brand new unit. This one arrived in one piece but that's about all there is to say for it. Absolutely will not buy again."
293,1,"I didn't do my homework and forgot to check for DRM before buying this game. Man was that a dumb move. I've now been sitting here for 2 hours trying to log in to steam and then installing the game. Even with the disk in the drive, I think steam is trying to download all of the install files. To be honest, it would have been faster to download a pirated copy of this game than to wait for steam to do its slow dance of torture.

I'd like to say I'll never buy another steam game again, but instead I'll just be more diligent and check for pirate releases before I waste time with steam again."
294,1,"Basically... This game sucks. The graphics suck, the dialog is boring, this title is overrated. I sold my copy to some idiot on eBay and I get a negative review because it sucks so bad. I rather play with a barbi than play this POS."
295,1,"I like adventure games, but I like them to follow some sort of logical  puzzle solving, so dyou can kind of get inside the mind of the creators,  figure out how they think and figure the game out that way. These puzzles  are completely illogical, obviously designed to be frustrating, and keep  you trying different senseless things to proceed in the game.  Also,  although the 2D backgrounds were interesting at times, calling this a 3d  game is quite a stretch by any definition. Even the 3d cut-scenes were  crappy, and the graphics during regular gameplay were just terrible.  Supposedly the game made ""game of the year"" in Europe, they must  be pretty hard up over there, now I know not to take that as a  commendation."
296,1,I wish you could give a negative star. The USB chargers are the wrong size for the PS4. They are positioned in the wrong place as well. Simply horrible
297,1,"This game runs at 720p on xbox one, what a joke right? But don't worry, The ps4 Runs at 1080p so you are safe :D

Thank me later"
298,1,"This does not work, I tried for hours to get this to work and it would not work. My computer would detect it but it would never calibrate and the controls would just flutter and fluctuate. Waste of time and money!"
299,1,"The game loaded well, needed to re-boot , no big deal, BUT it has a program protector , that destroys your computers drivers.
So I did not complete the download process.
Had I know about the game protection system, I would not have purchased the game."
300,1,"Do not purchase this it is complete crap. I want to be nice; wait, no I don't. This does't serve it's purpose at all. IT is complete trash. After using it for a few days over 4 hrs of use per day it becomes malleable and starts to fail miserably. Just go purchase the Zowie alternative and forget this piece of crap."
301,1,"I am no super smart person, but I bought the Rockband drums for my family for Christmas, and I bought the Cymbals to go with the drum set. Nothing states that the Cymbals will not work with the Wii Rockband drum set. After getting up Christmas morning and everyone happy and working together to get the drum set working they could not get the cymbals to work after digging through the instructions I found that the cymbals would only work with the Rockband 2. We did not know that there is a rockband, rockband 2 and now a rockband 3. For those of us that are not real gamers this was discussing."
302,1,"Bought mine in May 2017 and it is ""double clicking"" on single click after 5 months :( Unfortunately I have to deal with Corsair support for this since it has been discovered that this is a hardware issues due to the Omoron switches in the mouse itself. It's not a software bug sadly, they can't patch it out.

Sad, I really loved this mouse too. It was easily my favorite."
303,1,Riptide  is worst worst zombi game of alltime. It's a joke.
304,1,"If I wanted to play games at 720P I would stick with a PS3 or 360.

If you want graphics in stunning 1080P, buy a PS4. Over 2.1 million already have!

Merry Christmas everyone!"
305,1,"I thought The Sims was a cool concept at first, then i realized what a time consuming bunch of nonsense it is. Creating people and having a bit of fun for an hour or so to me is fine, but people are obsessed and sit in front of the computer playing this stupid game for hour upon hour, ignoring there families, friends and even WORK. ITS A GAME. make your real life, not a virtual one. I have nothing against thee game personally if you wanna play and have some fun for a little while, even small bits at a time. I played SIMS 2 and started to get a bit hooked so i said you know what this is worse than any drug, so i gave it up. Plus i just thing the whole thing is pretty lame. Word to the wise, game a bit, live a lot. Or get a life."
306,1,"Blah! I was looking for more free-to-roam games on the wiki and this game was on the list and when I read about it, it sounded fun so I brought it for Xmas only to be greatly disappointed.

What bothered me the most was that you HAD to do the missions and you HAD to drive a certain car. The game designers for this game were so up tight! He couldn't get into a car because of the lock, couldn't start the car after tearing the door down because again he never seen the lock before. Which makes no sense. If you are going to kick someone out of their car, they aren't taking heir keys with them!

Ugh! So I did the driving options. The countryside or city one and I loved the countryside because the graphics were nice but god forbid you mess that car up because he can't jack another one! Ugh! I'm starting to wonder why I got so bored with GTA San Anadreas."
307,1,"this isn't a lara core design had originally created and has zero of the things old school lara croft had and things that we used to care about all the original enemies like natla and her mentor Werner Von Croy are no longer here also they took away all her tools and uniqueness such as back flips cartwheels somersault and catchphrases so don't expect to be see dinosaurs bats or anything out of the ordinary  that used to be in TR games anytime soon lol now she's nothing more than a ripoff female version of drake from uncharted just more wimpy and too emotional lara in this reboot is now basic and generic thanks to crystal dynamics thats now known as square enix they twist her origin story that was in tr chronicles and completely changed her weapons ,mentor, and her age when she first had her adventure in the original lara explore when she was 6 with von croy in a cave in this reboot her first adventure is in her teens so they sort of changed her bio i guess it's just to please and attract a newer fan base

story #spoiler this game is about lara and her friends just as the trailer shows she was searching for a artifact that in a island but got trap in a storm before they find out that it wasn't a normal storm its from a storm god and survivors that is trap in that island started to worship it bcuz they felt like that island is curse once the ship crashed and wrecked and landed on the island everyone blamed lara because they wouldn't be in this situation bcuz of her blah blah blah long story abunch of pointless characters thats friends with lara dies in the story plot they try to get connect for rescue that fails and the most annoying character name sam gets kidnapped so they can transfer the storm god into sam body lara stops it in time and killing some guy that they met after that landed into the island bcuz it tuns out he was one of the insane survivors that was trap in the island - the end
honestly this main story is dry and shouldn't even be a tomb raider game this should be concerned a spin off in my opinion bcuz lara seems completely useless the story aint all that interesting and it tries to focus on everyone else but since this was the start of the first ever multiplayer TR game its the only reason i got this game speaking of online multiplayer it really need work there isn't variety of weapons u have to get a certain rank to unlock a character and ur character dies way to fast there isn't any health meter so u can only guess how much damage u can take bow arrows is overpowered and there's no crosshairs while aiming it feels more like a cheap knockoff of uncharted instead of a actual tomb raider game in my opinion it feels like they took everything away that gave TOMB RAIDER AN IDENTITY if u an old school TR fan i don't recommend bcuz u will be disappointed with all these unnecessary changes, just like this unnecessary reboot"
308,1,This game is a joke. You will be bored after the first hour trust me. The gameplay is derivative and the main character is one of the most boring characters I have ever played. There are also a lot of bugs and glitches. Seriously if you have to play it wait until used and on sale six months from now for ten bucks.
309,1,"Started off with a 4.5/5 star rating as you can see from my updates at the very bottom. Final rating is a 2/5.

I am near the end of the game (in about 18 hours no less). What started off as a nice, refreshing experience that pays homage to one of my favorite game series of all time quickly turns into a boring game with copious amounts of backtracking and little to no content aside from the main story. This isn't a Star Ocean game, it is the hollowed out corpse of a Star Ocean game.

The story isn't nearly as bad as other people have made it out to be. However, there is also little depth to the story. Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that you don't really care about the characters. Some of the private moments make no sense because there is no backstory to give it context.

The battle system is fine. One of the only good parts of the game.

The bulletin board quests are a joke. You can only do the same fetch X item quests so many times before it becomes monotonous.

The cities and towns are nice but there is nothing in them. The cities of star ocean 2 were half the size (or smaller in some cases) and yet there were tons more homes to enter, chests to gather, people to speak to. There is none of that in this game. The world map is no different. there are so few areas that they are forced to make new chests appear after certain points in the game in order for there to be some reason to explore.

There is no side content. Aside from the bulletin board quests, there really isn't much to do. The game just feels boring. Maybe that is why they don't allow you to save at certain points of the game. That way you will die, have to back track 20 minutes worth of stuff just to get back to where you were (the battle with Der-Suul).

One of my favorite parts of Star Ocean games is private actions and getting secret/optional characters. To this point, aside from endings, I couldn't find a single reason to continue to do PA's. I also hate the fact that there are NO secret/optional characters.

I don't really have an issues that there are some monsters from previous games as well as some music. To me, I enjoy that stuff. It doesn't feel cheap or like a short cut, it is nostalgic. I loved hearing some of the SO3 music from Kirlsa & Aquaria in this game. What I do have a problem with is that the only thing elements do is remind me of the former glory that Star Ocean had as a video game. Even with the short story and very linear game, it would have been fine with a great deal of post-game content. Although I am close to finishing the game, according to everything I have read, there isn't much to do.

Pick it up for $30 or something later on.

Update ---

I am now about 7 hours into the game. Still liking the game but I am adding some more Pro's and Con's and dropping the rating to 4 stars.

Pro's:
I like how they used some music from SO3 and incorporated it into this game. I also like the cathedral challenge thing. Pretty neat concept. I do like that there are a lot of enemies from other star ocean games and that the enemies change as you progress through the game. Story is good to this point (not great but good). I like the idea of harvesting/mining/fishing.

Con's: They have these big, beautiful cities and yet there is nothing to do in them. Private actions are minimal. In previous Star Ocean games you could enter almost every house in a given town/city to explore. The amount of treasure chests are minimal. I hate how battle skills aren't learned by levels but rather from miss able items.

So far it is still a good game and I would still recommend it to any Star Ocean fans. But I can't help but feel like they missed an opportunity to add more depth to this game. Also, as some people haven't been aware of this, if you are having camera issues you can zoom in and out using the d-pad.

-----

About 3 1/2 hours in and so far... I would give it 4.5 stars. Definitely feels like a Star Ocean game (which is great). It has many of the elements of a traditional JRPG. I loved Star Ocean 1, 2 and 3 but was not a fan of 4. The odd boss battles of 4 really turned me off (thankfully the boss battles in this game are more reminiscent of precious Star Ocean titles). As someone that has beaten Star Ocean 2 & 3 at least 5 times each, I am a big fan and 4 was just unplayable. I tried 4 different times to get into that game and I just couldn't. This game had me hooked almost instantly.

I really can't say much more other than I love the fact that the person that did the voice for Rena in the Star Ocean 2 PSP port also does the voice for a character in this game. So far the Item creation system seems good but I haven't progressed far enough to really test how complex and in depth it is.

I will continue to update this review as I get further. The one thing I am not a fan of is the in town environment. It isn't a huge deal but talking to NPCs can sometimes feel a bit awkward and clunky. Haven't had any issues with the camera as other people have but I can see why it would irritate some people.

Ignore the 1 star reviews that knock the story. Although I can't say for certain how it is, any 1 star review knocking the story can't be real as the game was just released today. How can you have seen any major plot twists or surprises when you haven't finished the game?"
310,1,"We've had consistent issues with the PS4:  (1) Extremely slow downloads in even with our high-speed connection;  (2) Frequent reports of connection problems even though other WiFi devices in the same room work flawlessly; (3) we have to pay to play on servers that are free for the PC versions of the same games; and (4) PSN is notifying us that we must change our password when receive an email, and my grandson is unable to use his PS4 until we do (still waiting for the email)."
311,1,No where near as good as 2012 or 2013.
312,1,Broke in 5 days.
313,1,"I have had multiple headsets for my PS3. They all worked fine, no problems. They all broke when I dropped my bag. My older brother really enjoys being able to talk over PSN and play games with me. So he spent $40 on this headset. It does not work, and when it does, it is annoying and unbearable to keep on.

I do not know where Sony's priorities are, but they are all over the place. Their PS3s are better bluray players than their bluray players, they make good systems, but not accessories. Next they are going to make a PS3-TV combo and forget to make remotes/controllers for it."
314,1,A total waste of money. It does not work on my PC. Just ended up deleting it from my machine.
315,1,26 Awards before the game is released. The modern gaming world is a pathetic cesspool of paid for reviews and hype. This game is an incomplete rip off and EA deserves it's worst company of the year award it earns every year.
316,1,"Even kids wouldn't care for this game for more than an afternoon. I knew it would consist of Olaf collecting snowflakes. That wasn't hard to predict. But there is NO enemies! And NO point to the game! Collect crap if you want to (that does nothing) and just walk through level after boring level. It is at best, an incomplete turd of a game. It looks like it is an unfinished product. Put this garbage on the app store for free. Don't box it up and scam people who loved what was an awesome movie out of thirty bucks. GameMill couldn't program a VCR, much less a good game. Always pay attention to the publisher/developer names. GameMill? GameWho? Guaranteed crap game. Not to say bigger publishers don't put out crap too but this was an obvious dog turd game. Poor Olaf. He didn't deserve this."
317,1,AOK
318,1,Maybe EverythingDeals should reconsider their name when they're selling twenty dollars for twenty five dollars.
319,1,"I was so excited to get this game I got it shortly before I received Supernatural. It installed just fine but when I get into the game it is slow and doesn't work well at all. The animals look like ghosts because there all see through, not to mention when I try to do anything with horses I mean anything the game crashes every single time. I play the newer Supernatural with out a single problem. I just don't get why EA fell so far from the bar with this one. All of the other Sims3 games play except for this one. Im SOOO frustrated that I have to go out and buy a gaming computer because of this. Its just crazy if you ask me so I give it a low rating because im not the only one that is having these issues."
320,1,"This game is so bad, you can't even get started in it, the instruction manual has no information of any use, and the on screen help is nonexistent. Go for Reel Fishing 3 or earlier reel fishing games such as 2 and the original one if you want to enjoy a fishing game."
321,1,"Just Cruise over to MetaCritic to see how low of a rating this game received from both critics and players alike.  Everything I loved about Cruis'n USA for N64 is completely gone to be replaced by terrible controls, terrible graphics, very long loading times, and a poor interface.

For some reason there are several good Amazon reviews (leading me to unfortunately buying this disaster), which you will see does not coincide at all with the plethora of negative reviews on MetaCritic.

Avoid at all costs.  Buy yourself Cruis'n USA on WiiWare instead."
322,1,Too hard to drive a simple car! You have to follow the line and still some races are too hard! They give you a random car and you have to race it and you can`t modify it. It would have been a good idea to give you a simulation test or a training stage to run all the cars or the basics.
323,1,"Horrible mouse, just stops working for 30 - 60 seconds randomly, worthless as a basic mouse, couldn't imagine trying to game with it.
Sent it back."
324,1,"This game is standard Madden. It has the monopoly on the Football franchise in video games. I've been playing the Madden games through the years and each game continues to have the same problems. For instance, holding calls against your team that you have no control over are irritating. Also, Computer AI on your side is garbage. If I'm running the ball and I have a lead blocker, that lead blocker will run in front of me for a sec and then avoid blocking the defensive player 9 times out of 10.

Passing plays are the same, butter finger receivers even if they are Megatron or Fitzgerald. Almost every pass that is not directly on the mark is intercepted by the defense. The defense intercepts balls so easily that it's a wonder how such good hands wouldn't be on the offensive side of the ball. Interceptions are so frequent that I decided to run the ball only and only throw screen passes. Of course doing this makes it difficult to win, but at least it's not impossible. I could be playing Tom Brady from the Patriots vs the Oakland Raiders defense and they will have 5 interceptions! It's like the receivers are not interested in catching the ball and the defenders can catch a ball ten feet in the air even if they are linebacker.

Madden has always had problems with the levels of difficulty. Usually, the games are way too hard or way too easy, but at least they were still fun. The computer has such unfair advantages that it makes the game not even remotely enjoyable. With so many previous versions to use as a point of reference it's hard to believe that any game developer could mess it up. It seems like the developers took what worked on previous additions and removed them, and then doubled down on the irritating things that everyone hates. Why on earth would you rename Franchise Mode ""Connected Careers?"" Is it to automatically confuse everyone? I bet the vast majority of first time Madden 13 players spent at least an hour trying to find Franchise Mode.

It's hard to believe that with all the technilogical advances and all the previous games to references these developers managed to create the worst Madden of all time. I would rather play Madden 95 on Sega Genesis."
325,1,"I had never thought I would see a game that was more grossly disappointing then ""Duke Nuke'em Forever"". Well one came out. And it had to be an even more iconic franchise, indeed it was the franchise that cemented the idea of what military science fiction should look and sound like. More horrible is the thought that ""Aliens"" is thee biggest influance of pass and current titles from other movies to book and video games; Doom, Halo, StarCraft even Dead Space all take inspiration from that second film.

Waking up on release day I first checked IGN to see what they had to say about Aliens: Colonial Marines. A rating of 4. Bad.  That was their official review.

But never the less IGN is known to have impossible high standards and most people seem to disagree with; plus one should never speak ill of any product without testing it yourself.

Oh Dear god IGN was Right. It's a horrible game.  This is why there is Gamefly.

Despite touting special sound effects from the movies, James Horner's music and voice talent by both Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen this game STILL fell several miles short. The graphics would be good if this was an Original Xbox game, there are next to no particle effects and the sound is muted. The music isn't as loud as it should be and seriously lacks that driving percussion that fallowed the latter half of the second Alien film, there is no satisfying ""thud"" as bullets smack into things or a meaty crunch as exoskeletons break apart like Dungeness crab legs, absolutely everything is half assed here, so much that the 2010 version of Aliens Vs Predator is massively superior game.

The plot is this, you rescue Hicks. That's really it in a nut shell, turns out Hicks wasn't in his cryo-chamber when the other ones where jettison because Wayland Yutani PMC had boarded the ship and took him hostage. You go find him, disrupt Wayland operations, kill a lot of Xenos and PMCs, that's it."
326,1,very bad
327,1,"First, I'd like to say that I do like a lot of role playing games. Skies of arcadia, Fable series, Mass Effect series, and more are quite excellent.  I feel that this game certainly is not.  This is of course my OPINION.  I cannot stand people who who call other people's reviews stupid or idiotic for expressing their opinion.  I am now expressing mine.
I picked this game up for $7 plus change at target on clearance a few months ago.  Never before have I felt cheated when spending $7 on a game.  The graphics are good.  That's about it.  It has WAY too many cutscenes.  The combat is horrible.  Basically, I tried to play it twice for an hour or so and it was painful.  I wanted to like it but, just couldn't.
I do not understand the great reviews for it.  Then again, I don't know why people like reality TV shows either.....

My point:  Just because everyone else feels it's good doesn't mean that everyone will agree.  How this came from the same womb as Mass Effect is completely beyond me."
328,1,Had the misfortune to see this latest foray into rewriting American history to the betterment of Africans everywhere.  Give me a break.
329,1,"I play video games to have fun, not to be frustrated. I spent three hours playing this game, but that's the last three hours Resident Evil will ever get from me. You have to stand still to shoot?! You can only punch/kick/jump/etc. only when prompted? Camera angle sometimes changes by itself...especially when I need to face the enemies, not have my back toward them. Ammo is too limited for the number of enemies to kill. I have to use the knife a lot of the time, and you have to hold L2 all the time to have it equipped. Why can't you do just a one-time toggle like other games? My hands hurt playing this game for only three hours. Stupidly designed game. There are other cons, but my hands are too tired to type right now, from playing this very frustrating game. Good-bye, Resident Evil. I will spend my next $60 on another game, not Resident Evil 6."
330,1,Never worked.
331,1,"Rareware is dead to me! I hate this video game a lot! It's Jak 2 all over again! They change the theme, make it too much and too boring to do, and instead of questing throughout a land, we're stuck in a crappy city! None of the worlds are that interesting! ANd what does Banjo need to do? He has to race! No No No! That is not the theme of the Banjo-Kazooie franchise! What did Banjo- Kazooie or Tooie even have to do with building or driving vehicles? It didn't! This is coming out of nowhere! Also has anyone looked at the characters? They all  looked cuter and interesting in the first two games, but now they're just ugly looking! It's a disgrace!"
332,1,"While I like the type of strategic battle - turn based mixed with grid based movement - i.e. SRPG; I could not get into this game. The feather element is inventive (strategic sacrifice of a party member in battle). The ""sin"" element is inventive, but feels flawed, for lack of a better term, and makes battles either too hard (usually) or too easy.
I have a feeling I picked the worst Valkyrie Profile game to start with.
Aside from that: The graphics look like 8 bit or worse!, the story felt REALLY boring to me, and the game, in general, is tedious. The 3rd battle you're in is a bit too difficult for the beginning of the game. I can look past that since eventually I progressed, but the game continued to be, as my title states, and forgive my redundancy, tedious and boring. A big let down for a Square Enix game. Perhaps I'll try my luck with a different V.P. game."
333,1,"The game doesn't work, at the beginning it will not let me go upstairs even though I have done everything to get up their.  I ask friends and they have the same problem so I went on the web and tried what they said but no go so I got a bad game. That's 2 games I have gotten that doesn't work! !! So I will stick to Big Fish games I have never gotten a bad game from them!!!!!!"
334,1,"This game has by far the worst physics of any game I've ever played. The control system is overly difficult to get used to and even when you do it isn't easy to play. The game is abnoxiously dark (as the game says in the title) so it's really hard to see anything, even with the brightness turned way up. Enemies in this game are more difficult than they should be and mercilessly pummel you even on the easiest setting. I got fed up with this game after 3 hours and tossed it in the bottom of my game basket with my old Atari and Nintendo games. Save your money and time and avoid this game like the plague."
335,1,"I am a die hard fan of CoH, i waited a long time for this new sequel, i didn't know Sega would be involved in this game, they took the CoH title and crapped all over it, the game is nothing like the previous installment, its a shadow of what we are used to from CoH, also you won't be able to play the game, i couldn't even finish the first mission, it crashes and there are no efforts to fix these bugs and issues with the game, its a complete waste of money and i don't encourage anyone to buy this game."
336,1,"Please save your money and do not buy this game. If you want a good LOTR game buy the two towers for any platform. First off I had problems with sound (I have sb live plat 5.1) so if it doesn't work well for sound blaster what does it work well for. The graphics are okay, but being as how the gameplay is LAME and the quests you get are lame.. do not buy this. They took a good story and went off in the wrong direction. I ended up returning this after giving it a decent chance (even with the sound problems)"
337,1,I am very sad to see that the sim city franchise has come to an end I played this game as a boy and was going to pay 60$ for it easy but after finding out they no longer allow ownership I decided against it.
338,1,A.I is laughable and the graphics are crap. do not waste your money or time on this garbage. 0/10 would never play again.
339,1,"This remote is the worse, the function keys don't really work, I have to use it in conjunction with the controller."
340,1,"I played this game and it was a complete MESS , little by little i started hating it more and more . it was difficult to maneuver and just confusing . Do Not Buy This Game ."
341,1,I would love to purchase this game but sadly I will not be doing so. This game could have been great but is tainted with the stink of DRM (SecuROM) enforced limited installs. The DRM is a part of the game that you can't avoid if you install it so I must focus my review on the DRM. Supposedly this game releases the authorization if you uninstall the game but what happens if there is a problem contacting the server at the time the uninstaller tries to do so? It probably won't release your install. What happens if your system crashes and you just format or you buy new hardware and forget to uninstall the game? Your authorization won't be released. Then you have to call them and hope that they believe you purchased the game in order to play once you run out of authorizations. If they don't believe you I don't know what the procedure is but you probably won't be playing anytime soon. It would just be another hoop that they want you the legitimate customer to jump through and hope it works. I would recommend that everyone stop purchasing games with these limitations. The only people hurt by these limitations are the legitimate customers. Pirates will have the games from day one regardless. The game itself has been getting good press which makes me sad because the limiting DRM that it is saddled with will keep me from getting it. Luckily these days there are many other games out there to be had that don't force this DRM on the end user so I will be looking elsewhere.
342,1,"I rented this game and to my horror I had to use the right anologue stick to fight, that's so uncomfortable. I played it for 40 mins and took it back to Blockbuster and that's the first time I've done that with a rented game."
343,1,"With this game you drive around a circle with other cartoons from the mario world, You can't go shopping
so you have to wear the same outfit that you started with . Also for some strange reason everytime i am behind someone
they shoot a turtle shell at me, animal abuse much? Also they don't tell you how to get good at the game, so whenever
you start you are going to get owned. OH and if your Wii u is dusty from not playing it in 1 year, you may want to blow
it off. Anyways i rate this game 1/5, for obvious reasons. But i recommend this game if you are a big fan. so 5/5 for big fans :D

If you have any questions, post below. I will be glad to help."
344,1,"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.

You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.

The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.

I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.  There is a couple of months for the developer to correct their mistakes before the second part of this game is released in July of 2011 but I'm not holding my breath."
345,1,No fun at all!
346,1,"You'd think that this being the first of the NHL franchise titles on a new generation of consoles would make EA want to step up their game and take advantage of this opportunity. There was a lot to like about the previous title NHL 14, and the game brought players closer than ever to a realistic gaming experience. With clever marketing video game publisher EA Sports cashes in on gamers who are anticipating a great new hockey title for their new console. They fool us because (and this hard to say) it is not a complete game! Have you ever played a game that felt unfinished, poorly made and rushed? NHL 15 is the definition of that.

The sad part is EA allows themselves to be lazy and release unfinished games because they don't have any competition. They make fancy commercials praising it's product taunting fans with ""new and improved additions"" making the envy of gamers everywhere. The only thing NHL 15 has to it's credit is improved graphics (splendid on the PS4) and that's only due to the new consoles, that would be giving EA too much credit.

I, like many others just wanted a fun NHL game for my new console. As a big fan of hockey, l had september 9 marked on my calendar. Where's Living the Life mode? It showed potential in '14, but is not here. The menus are frustrating and bad just like the new referee system where the refs mostly get in your way. Where are create modes? 3 stars of the game? GM Mode feels rushed. There's so many things that aren't there, it's mind boggling. Online play? Essentially useless. That's basically it (other reviewers have done a great job at outlining all that is wrong/missing so l won't get too much into it). But hey we get new commentators right? Ugh.

Be patient for updates? How about release a game that's complete. If it isn't don't, delay it, making the customers angry is not smart. Waste of 60$.It doesn't make me happy to write this review. I rarely ever give one star rating but EA you should be ashamed and l feel ripped off. I'll surely be trading this in or getting my money back. Do not fall for the ""hype"". Be wiser. I'd give it negative ten if l could. Essentially useless and a cash grab. I'm not sure l'll ever buy an EA title again at this point. Keep your NHL 14s for the time being, you'll be happy you did."
347,1,"The gameplay had me 1 yawn away from falling asleep. The cell shaded graphics are no match for the graphic capabilities of the PS4, and will leaving regretting not buying this game cheaper for the ps3. Gameplay does not give this game the meat to be considered any type of classic,and the sound acting is basic. Go play Last of Us Remastered and pretend you didn't stoop to playing a overrated rendition of a burnt out TV show."
348,1,"This game is unplayable. The graphics, presentation, music, sound effects, and gameplay are all bad. I got this game for $15 and I can confidently say I was ripped off. The reviews for this game are misleading."
349,1,Don't waste your money... Very poor looking graphics.
350,1,"First off, unless i just have a ""bad"" unit, this unit's ""mouse"" mode isn't TRUE mouse mode....and when i say ""true"" i mean there the mouse arrow appears and you use it like a real mouse with the controller and yes, get yourself a bluetooth mouse and you will see what i mean. There are times this controller will just stop with nothing but the blue button going and the most minimal use. It doesn't respond well connected to Windows 10.

Again, it's possible i got a bad unit What bothers me most is: I contacted the company and they did nothing, i mean they didn't even hit me back when i emailed them.

What kind of company is this?"
351,1,"I have nothing good to say about this pathetic exscuse for a video game. It's just all around terrible. The graphics make you wanna vomit,the controls will make your thumbs sore,the game modes all suck and the horrible repetative music makes you go nuts. Stay far far away from this nightmare of a game. Even if it's a buck!"
352,1,This item used to be 15 $ and then Plus the response time before this is 25 milliseconds my monitor is better than this and it was only 100 $
353,1,"Very thin/fragile wire, which means you WILL be replacing this in a year or so.

Oh, want to use USB headphones like you did on PS3? Sorry, MS has decided you need to either buy the worst $25 headset in the world or shell out $200 for some wireless ones from Turtle (apparently the only company allowed to come out with wireless headsets for the xbone).

As usual, money grabs from MS. Avoid."
354,1,"Sierra brought us many wonderful titles over the years, including the Kings Quest, Hero's Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry serials.  In most cases, they did a good job putting together creative, cute, situation driven puzzle games.  Here, they delivered an appalling blend of poor graphics, bad language, and simplistic game play.

Gone are interaction with characters, puzzles, and good writing.  Instead, one plays simple 2-D mini-games and views poorly developed cut-scenes.

The game is a bizarre blend of exceptionally childish ""humor,"" such as fart jokes and random acts of not-very-clever profanity, coupled with 4 or 5 mini-games so shoddy and simplistic they recall the days of CGA.  Too simple for those over 10, too profane for those under 16, this game would not be worth playing if it were free.  At $50, Sierra sells their reputation and little else.  I will think twice, and read some reviews, before purchasing another Sierra product."
355,1,"I'm so irritated with this product that even after years of it sitting in my purchased list I feel the need to give it a negative review. I vowed never to give EA or Maxis another penny, and I have stayed true to that resolution after purchasing this game. Since this game has been released they have made no improvements to the core elements of the game that where flawed by design. This game is not a city builder. They realized they had a problem with their agent system's efficiency, so they did everything in their power to minimize the amount of space the player had to generate agents. Buildings that are core to your city are massive. With the limited amount of space you cannot build a metropolis, or anything close to what you could in previous versions of the game.

If you want a city builder pick up the game that took everything Maxis failed to execute and did it majestically, Cities: Skylines."
356,1,Didnt turn onn after chargeing.
357,1,"No offline mode. Online servers are all full... When I did get in after an hour of trying, it only let me play the tutorial. Couldn't even start a new city...

Stay away from this horrible game."
358,1,"This game is complete crap. The graphics look decent,but the gameplay is for sh**.I can't even begin to tell you how bad ""Batman & Robin"" is. First off,the controls are terrible. You have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fight,drive the batmobile,swim,use the gadgets...it's even a pain to try and walk. The map of Gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the same. The game is also almost impossible. You get one life. After you die,it's game over,and right back to the beginning. You can also die quickly as well. You can play as either Batman,Robin or Batgirl,but their combat moves look absolutley retarded. Overall,this is THE WORST Batman game I have EVER PLAYED! ""Batman Forever"" on Genesis was better then this dud,and we all know how bad that game was. I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this. The ONLY reason why you MIGHT wanna purchase this,is because it's a pretty rare game,and it could be a part of your game collection,but as far as the game itself goes....IT SUCKS!"
359,1,"Visually the game looks amazing. The cars are sleek and very detailed especially when driving in the cockpit view. But what held the game and what made me leave a 1 star was the micro transactions.

Coming from a player who LOVED Forza 4, horizon was ok but I fell in love with Forza 4. After you get somewhat into the game you realize that it lacks content because everything else is through micro purchases. Some cars are worth an entire game! Even if they reduced the micro prices, at the end of the day I paid $60, give me the cars to drive. I can understand if they charge for tracks. That I wouldn't mind but I bought the game to drive cars and customize them. Why should I have to buy cars with actual money? I know you can buy cars with in game credits but to earn the amount of credits to purchase some of the cars will take forever.

I really enjoyed Forza 4 and Forza 5 feels like a step back imo. Especially when I enjoyed drifting and downhill drifting. For those who just want a visual game and don't mind a few cars this is for you I guess. But other than that I suggest waiting until this game hits in the $20 range. Glad I returned it for Dead Rising."
360,1,"It was not the correct card.  Although advertised to fit the Wii, when it arrived it was for a Nintendo game cub., not the Wii.  Very disappointed, but didn't want the hassle and wait of returning it."
361,1,"I loved this game. When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different. If you want Star Wars, take it from me: this is no longer it, and is not worthy of anyone's hard-earned cash."
362,1,"It has been a long time since I bought a college football game or madden football and I was getting tired of waiting on EA  to make a good madden football game. The last good football game I got was madden 10.
The last ncaa football game I got was 2005.

Now back to ncaa 13, this game is the worse football game I have ever bought and I am not trying to be funny. This game has been copy and paste to another  disc from last year's game but it is terrible.
The colors of the grass, uniforms, and everything is washed out in this game.  The Sound effects is terrible and the tackling sounds is gone.
The crowds in the stands are like cutout cardboard pictures. Nothing looks real and there are no cheerleaders on the field making you feel like you are playing a real college football game. The colors are washed  out so bad that it hurts my eyes to look at the game while I am playing it. out  Do not buy this game. even though  other reviews give this game a 5 and called  this game a great game. They are not telling the truth at all.  There are some reviews who will not write the truth about EA games for some unknown reason. But I am here to tell you the truth and I have nothing to gain  or lose.
NCAA FOOTBALL 12 got a rating of 7.0
NCAA FOOTBALL 13 got a 6.5  but it should have gotten a 4.0 byy gamespot.com
So I took NCAA FOOTBALL 13 back to the game store and trade it in for NCAA 12 and I was pleased. You better get rid of NCAA FOOTBALL 13 before you will not get any money back for it, especially if you paid $65. I paid $44.99 for that copy and I lost about $15 on it.

EA is also making madden 13 and I will not buy this game until I see it even if there are great reviews and rating. If it is not better than madden 10, I will not buy it even though I love playing football. I got a bad feeling that madden 13 is going to be made  very similar to ncaa 13 because EA makes both games and it looks like they do a lot of copying and pasting.

Do not buy this game. Rent it first
Do not buy!!!"
363,1,Would not charge the battery was able to play plugged in but the cord was very short so I would be sitting literally two feet away from the Xbox
364,1,"Would you buy a new car that is missing basic standard features like airbags, power steering and power windows?  Yes, you could still drive the car, but it would be a lousy experience and a waste of your money.  That analogy applies here.  Final Fantasy XIV is missing too many basic features.  Add to that the severe lack of content, and you have one game that was simply not ready for release.  It needed about another 6 months.  If this game was still a beta, these issues could be forgiven or understandable.  But since you have to PAY for this mess, its absolutely fair to say this game is not ready.  All the criticism is warranted.

Pros: Great graphics, if your PC can handle it.
Cons: Horrible UI, Lack of content, missing many basic features, boring world, lack of real quests, too much lag, and worst of all, just not fun.

Come back to this game in 6 months (Maybe for the PS3 release). It may be worth your money then."
365,1,"I never cared much for Aerosmith (take it as you will, that is my opinion), but I always rather liked Guitar Hero. However, this one lets down is near every way possible. Even when played on mute just to achievement hunt, it didn't seem worth it, it just wasn't up to par. The only people who would like this are did hard Aerosmith fans."
366,1,"Prior to my update; I had a high opinion of this game.
However, as of January 2013, I deem this game is in no condition to be sold.

It is HEAVILY bugged.
The game publisher THQ went bust, and now no one will fix the many problems still in the game!

Here are just some of the many bugs that will forever go unpatched;

** Story Designer bugs
(No crowd audio during matches in Story Designer. Also players have reported freezing when trying to save a created story among many, many other issues.)
** Superstar threads glitch
(When you create a new attire coloration for some superstars, the attire will appear spotty in-game)
** Ring announcer bug
(The ring announcer will sometimes not announce a superstar as they make their way out to the ring, but instead just say ""AND"")
** Created finishers bug
(Created finishing moves deal considerably less damage than ordinary special moves)
** Various moves cause perma-freezing
(Though not very frequently; at times when a player does a move on another, it will cause a perma-freeze to one or sometimes both superstars)
** 1 count bug
(even after heavily damaging an opponent [A.I. controlled] you'll get only a one-count)
** Broken Attributes
 (Players have tested attributes and proven that many of them have no affect)
** Broken Pin bar
(even after dealing a considerable amount of damage to an opponent [user controlled] their kick out meter will still be large.)
** Triple-Threat matches don't work [A.I]
(A.I. in triple threat matches are the absolute worst. Triple-Threats will always turn into a handicap match one way or another because A.I. only changes target when you hit them. If nobody hits them, guess what? Whoever they were targeted on when the match begins remains their target throughout!)

Virtually every mode of the game has some sort of problem. Including the Universe mode.
I also want to add that the online servers are terrible. Even with 2k now ""supporting"" WWE '13."
367,1,why didn't it come with my 3ds?
368,1,"I bought this thinking it was a good deal but it not this product was ""refurbished"" and when I unboxed it the wires were cut making it imossible to connect t the game adio I strongly recommend buying a new one"
369,1,NO GORE?!
370,1,"EDIT: Thank you for the corrections, but I stand by my review. Although I do think they could fix it with a slight visual update.

First off I would only reccomend this to a person that has not played the original Fable on Xbox. It's basically Fable one on the Fable two/three engine.
This is actually worse than the Halo one remake, which I didn't think was possible. The problem that was there was absolutely no multiplayer, it just included few downloadable maps for Halo:Reach. Anyway, same issue with this game, but graphics-wise. On the back of the box they said they just re-made the lighting... no they re-made the entire game.

All of the the unique art effects for the fire, the lightning, and even the 'force push' are gone, replaced by generic effects. The character you play as is hideous now, although to be fair most others do look well with their updates. The other one star review was right about the lag, it seems this game is always choppy and still loading even after it is finished, but I haven't had it freeze on me yet. There are bugs like followers not following you through loading screens also.

I am a huge Fable fan so i'll try to enjoy it as much as I can but... it's bad. It's always nice to see the Unreal engine at work, but this is a sloppy remake instead of a port, which it should have been because Fable one has always had very good graphics, it didn't need any updates, just achievements.

I will say again that you probably will enjoy this if you're a casual player, haven't played the original, or just don't remember it that well. It came out ten years ago, so most of the positive reviews will have a nostalgia bias."
371,1,"I bought this for my fiance, she left me and I haven't seen her since.  That's the last time I buy a game for my girlfriend."
372,1,"The graphics are terrible and the game is slow and difficult to get around. The game in general is unique in it's own messed up way, but it could have been better. I wasn't digging the 3 dimensional thing going on and the slowness of how the characters moved."
373,1,doesn't play
374,1,"This butchering of our games HAS to stop! Please, do not support NOA and these disgusting censored watered-down games that they sanitize for you like we're all little sheltered babies. Its pathetic."
375,1,"I have taken very good care of this, however after a few weeks it just went blank, the worst part is, and why I wrote ""Do not buy from Amazon"" is because I wrote Datel to request a repair and I was told that Amazon.com is not considered an offical seller of this product, so even though I bought this new, I cannot get it fixed."
376,1,"Save your money I expected more from this game, I was hoping to see improved graphics and gameplay, but unfortunately this game seemed to be rushed, it's complete garbage!!!  After this I will never purchase a game from DMRx. in conclusion if your a nascar game fan I would recommend you find your old GameCube console and play nascar on that."
377,1,Did not fit right.....also can not use a stand charger with this on your controller. Not worth the hassle.
378,1,"This PS3 wasn't tested and if it would of been you would of seen easy, that it didn't work. Waste of time and very frustrating, did you really think we wouldn't try to actually try to use the item we bought and we would never figure out it doesn't work.  I really never leave a bad comment, and I always try to be as honest as I can to help people who might be considering buying what I already have bought and they read the reviews."
379,1,"I wish I could give 0 stars. Don't read the other review about it being the exact color, it's not even close. I ordered bright green thumb grips that looked the same green color in the pics, hose are he right color. However this cover for the controller is a dark green. Its not even as bright as the A button, it does fit perfectly, but not even close to the same color"
380,1,Really this is a bad game. It has good graphics but horrible storyline so look for this if your an idiot.
381,1,"The game has terrible control, terrible characters, and is just awful to play"
382,1,"I've been looking forward to this game for so long only for them to pull an EA and demand online play only!!!
I'm done with this company."
383,1,This game is garbage better ask for a refund ubi got really lazy on this turd
384,1,It was a gift for my son game was scratched did not work was a waste of money.
385,1,"Came with a Sims 3 disk, not the Generations disk."
386,1,"I am not the best video game reviewer.  I don't have hundreds of games, in fact I am very limited.  I have played FF7 and 8, I loved seven the most, eight was fine but too depressing IMO.  I had seen so many good reviews and heard so many good things about X and seeing that they did a part 2 to X, well I had to buy it (needless to say I got the Playstation 2 this Christmas so like I said, not the biggest video gamer).
I wanted to like X I really did.  It had some breathtaking scenes and CGs.  Some of the action was inviting.  The characters themselves were very interesting.  But.  There was one anime movie after the next, very little if any character choices to go here there and everywhere.  The storyline was so convoluted that I could not make heads or tails of what was going on, not to mention I could not understand what this Sin being was (looked like a mutant whale to me)  It was so linear and it was so tight that I got bored easily, very easily.  I felt that there were waaayyy too many tutorials. I could not and cannot understand the character evolution dynamics.  I don't understand the whole structure even with help from the walkthrough books and what I looked up on the net, maybe its just me, but this game did not fit me at all.
I seriously doubt I will get X-2 now.  Oh well.  Live and learn!"
387,1,the story mode is stupid and its a waste of money you cant do splat fest without internet. very stupid game
388,1,Do not like it. Too many mini movie cartoons that are so so. The achievements are total thumbs down pewie. Not really made in America. Did not see or hear any for real vets. Saw a lot of bologny during multi player especially with the EA interactive players.
389,1,I wish i could give this more stars.  The Power Stand Charger for PS3 looked like it would be a great addition to my gaming console however the seller never shipped it to me.
390,1,Game sucks stay away
391,1,"I have to say that if there is one game in the past ten years that I believe was an absolute waste of time devoid of any entertainment value, this is it. What didn't I like about this game?

1. Corniest storyline ever. I kept playing hoping it would get better but it actually got progressively worse. The ending? I'm not giving away specific spoilers but lets just say the last boss was freaky in a corny way and the end clip really got me POed. Not a good way to end a game at all.

2. The combat is clunky and cumbersome. Also, you are limited to carrying 24 rounds of ammo for your gun for no reason whatsoever! I angrily left behind ammo because I had too much. This forces you to do melee combat or run. With the crappy camera angles, especially in hallways, that translates to running. Thats not fun.

3. The enemies were poorly made. One in particular is a big man in the front with a woman body attached at the back?!? Lmao. Again, the last enemy in particular was especially awful; especially what happens when you beat him.

4. Repetition redux - You spend alot of time backtracking through areas you've already been through. I'd say of the 10 hours I spent playing, 3 hours were spent exploring new areas.

I spent $15 dollars on this game and still think I got ripped off. Avoid at all costs!"
392,1,700$ um no
393,1,PS4 is weak. Xbox for the win
394,1,"Returned, due to bad display and description I returned the item.  It was sent for a PS4 and I have a PS3."
395,1,Quit working after 3 months
396,1,"This game is poorly made and imposible to complete. I coulden't even get pass the 1st level. Don't buy this piece of junk, it is not worth your time."
397,1,"The game's netcode is absolutely awful, to the point that the game is unplayable.

The host can come around a corner and kill you by the time you pull the trigger.  It's literally almost impossible to kill the host. especially at close quarters inside buildings.  The host can run around the buildings in the center of every map and clean up against anyone.

It's akin to being a new/bad player going up against pros, except every single game match is like that.

What's less fun than dying over and over again?  Getting kills you don't earn.  The horrible spawn system will at times spawn you directly behind an enemy player or the enemy team for an easy kill that is painfully unsatisfying.  I get no excitement for cheap shotting an enemy player who doesn't have a chance to win.

Other times, the game will spawn an entire team right in front of you, and you'll get wasted instantly.

The host is literally a second ahead of all the other players.  He'll see you and kill you by the time you see him.  It makes close quarters combat miserable.  You'll go around the corner or he'll come around the corner and wham, you're dead.  Watching the kill cam confirms that he put enough bullets into you to kill you, but you never shot him once.

The only counter to the host, is the shotguns, but they're noob weapons with extremely huge spread in the crosshairs, and like spawning behind somebody, it's totally unsatisfying.  I hate killing other players with shotguns, and you will too.

The flaws are so miserable, that I can hardly believe they released the game in this condition.

other 'features' this game has are unlimited sprint and unlimited wallrunning, both of which are invitations to die.  Either option gives you momentum which prevents you from changing direction, which means that you're an extremely easy target for the enemy.  I can't tell you how many times I've killed a sprinting or wallrunning player without even trying.

To make matters worse, you have to blow points on perks to ready your weapon faster, which is the only way to make sprinting a feasible option.

So, basically, all players do is camp.  It's the only viable strategy.

The game is played like this :  There are hardpoints on every map from which to camp from :  a wall, a concrete barricade, a window, basically anything you can camp behind and shoot from without exposing much of your own body to make you an easy target.  In between Hard points is no mans land, being out in the open with no cover, thus exposing your entire body to the enemy.

Being caught in no mans land by enemy players is death.

The only way to advance in the game, is by sprinting from hard point to hard point, spending as little time as possible in no mans land.

I feel like every time I catch an enemy player in no mans land, I get a kill I don't deserve.  I usually never take any damage from these players.  It's almost like executing an unarmed prisoner with a firing squad... there's not a chance in hell they'll survive.  So where's the fun?

There is fun in fair firefights where 2 players both find themselves in no mans land having a firefight.  Or when 2 players find themselves both in cover at hard points, having a firefight from hard point to hard point.

But sadly, these encounters are a rarity.  Most players are not willing to take the risk of entering no mans lands, and for good reason : it's almost impossible to survive.

By camping at a hard point, even if you have a 4 players spawn in front of you, you still have the chance of picking an enemy off before his buddies can flank or rush your position.

But, if you're caught in no mans land against 4 players, you're instantly dead.

I understand why the game suffers from so much lag and host advantage.  They're using peer to peer hosting rather than dedicate servers.

But I do not understand why the spawn system is so awful, and why you must burn so many perks on having any ability to run and gun.

It's just bad, broken game design.  I get no fun out of being killed from behind by a player who spawned directly behind me, and I get even less fun out of killing someone else from behind.

I get no fun out of having an entire team spawn right in front of me and getting wiped out instantly.

I get no fun out of wasting all my perks and points trying to make run and gun viable, when it never really will be and is a total waste of time.

Players who design their class around camping hard points have a huge advantage over players who design their class for run and gun in no mans land.  Players who don't want to camp are punished severely for even trying to attack.

*Some hard points with high ground are grenade and rocket catches.  These 'catch points' are more effective than others, but it's countered by the 'catch' design which makes it easy for someone to throw a grenade or shoot a rocket at you.  It's a nice little risk reward system.  I've gotten a lot of kills from them, and a lot of deaths from them.  It's smart map design.

**  The best feature in the game are special abilities for your choice of special soldiers.  It's unlocked by earning points that aren't lost when you die.  It's basically the support killstreaks from MW3, except it's always active and you don't have to sacrifice your ability to earn kill streaks to use it.  It's the smartest idea Treyarch has ever had, and it adds an extra layer to excitement as the game match progresses.  Unfortunately, some of these special weapons take less or no skill to use, which can be frustrating when you die without any chance of winning.  I don't think the special abilties were balanced well.  The more noob abilties should take more time and points to unlock, to compensate for their 'noobness'.  I feel like they never even play tested these abilities, like the mine layer abilty, or the gravity spikes.  You don't even have to aim these abilties.

I love the new jet pack.  It's fun and extremely responsive.  It controls perfectly and is always fun to use.  It's by far the best implementation of a jet pack (or jumping for that matter) ever in videogames.  A pure pleasure.

Wall running is also intuitive and fun.

the guns feel good to aim around.

The great controls add an extra layer of excitement to the game.

Sprinting causes the screen to jerk minimally, which makes you feel more like a machine.  can't decide if I like or dislike this, but it certainly sets the game apart from other call of dutys.

It all feels really polished.

Sometimes your character will not grab a ledge, causing you to fall to your death.

Shooters are all about gun porn, and Black Ops 3 has some of the best weapon renders ever.

And the gun designs are all new.  There's no M4, M16, AK47, USP, M9, UMP, MP5..... none of that.  They're all new designs.  What a pleasant surprise.  I realize that usually when these guns make an appearance in call of duty, they always get reskinned and usually get reshaped, but you can usually still tell exactly what gun they are.  Designing completely new weapons is a big risk because it severs the link between fiction and reality.  Most shooters have a lot of real world weapons to ground the game in reality.  BO3 takes a big risk to go all out.  So it's great that theyve done this.  You can still see the precursor to many weapons.  The weavil was inspired by the Rcp90, a gun which I hate.  But i like the way the weevil looks.  So it's like, they put all this effort into fixing up old guns to look not only different, but way better.  The ARK7 is a futuristic AK47, and so on.

The graphics are great.  Beautiful textures and shaders.  5/5 for visuals.  It's a massive improvement over their previous games and takes full advantage of next gen hardware.  It's got the best looking hi res assets you will ever see.
I also love the weapon reload and death animations.

I also love the player's arms and hands.  Getting this right is essential to any first person shooter, and it looks fantastic.  The best renders you have ever seen in any FPS.

I didn't realize Treyarch was capable of these visuals.  It's the kind of massive leap forward that makes you wonder who developed it.

I'm not sure how to describe black ops 3's graphics compared to their earlier games COD3, World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2.  When I say it's their best looking game ever, I mean that at the time these games came out, they were not impressive as this game is now.

It's a mind blowing leap forward for Treyarch, and it runs at 60 framers per second.

It makes me wonder if it's the best looking game ever made.  Maybe MGS5 has better face renders, but you only see those close up in cutscenes, so it's not really a fair comparison.

I can't really decide if it's the best looking game ever...  I don't feel comfortable saying it is or isn't, but it must be good to generate that kind of confusion.

Suffice to say that Black Ops 3 is as good as games can look.

I can talk about how great the graphics are all day, but it doesn't matter if the game is unplayable.  And the multiplayer is unplayable.

It's Sad that all Treyarch's hard work as gone to waste, but it's also true.

For me, the whole point of multiplayer is to test your skill against other living players.  That's what I find fun about it.  Strategy comes in a distant second.  You will find both lacking here.

There's fun to be had here in the well designed maps, but the Lag, Host advantage, Net Code and Spawn points make you suffer to get to it.

Every once in a while, you'll run into another player while you're both in no mans land, and have a sick shootout putting both your skills to the test...

And then the host comes around the corner and kills you instantly."
398,1,i bought this game at gamestop today and at first i was like wow soo cool then after the beginning part the game goes down hill. went driving for 40minutes no enemies at all i restarted thwe game and this time it was just a hassle gameplay is lacking. graphics are amazing but that shouldn't make the game itself sadly.
399,1,I can not play the disk version of this game. the graphic resolution is worse than bad. I think this game is too old to play on my system.
400,1,"I'm flabbergasted for two reasons:

First, how did Activision manage to make a PS2 sequel to a PS1 game that's actually WORSE than the original??  It defies logic! This game has the absolute WORST CAMERA ANGLES OF ALL-TIME!!!  To top it off, the character movement and combat is ""wooden"" at best.  I have better games on my friggin cell phone.

Second, how in the LL Cool J did so many Amazon users give this a good review??  Argh!

You'd be better off playing PS1 'Tenchu: Stealth Assassin' again than wasting your time on this stinker.  Seriously.

ADDED:
Playing Wrath of Heaven is like playing the unfinished test-version of Stealth Assasin."
401,1,There is a reason this was given away for free.
402,1,"fun until lvl 30 then you have to deal with other players
and that make the game become a piece of trash
I totally not recommended unless you like to waste your $$
.
UPDATE
Ubisoft hate the gamers
the game constantly crash or get stuck on the loading screen
and if you're lucky enough to be able too log in
you may end up to fall under the map
then people write down articles about the PC desktop is dying
sure it is because company like Ubisoft is constantly releasing unfinished product
my advice to everyone is;
stop buy games with Ubisoft signature
that is the only way to force THEM TO DO THEIR FREAKING JOB"
403,1,"I'm sorry to say but this game just sucks.  I hate when people tell me that the battle system is awesome, because it really isn't.  I played for a few hours and didn't mind it at first because yes it was interesting, but when I actually look at it I realized that it was all unnecessary.  It takes way to much to time do and almost very easy to understand only after a few hours.  I compare this game to FF13 because what I feel when you make a new battle system, there should be room for innovation.  With this game's battle style it just felt like once you got it, you got it.  There's no way to experiment with it and try to challenge yourself.  I know a lot of people say FF13 was horrible but I actually liked it because when I played I was able to try different combinations of characters and such which allowed it be very challenging at times.  Like I said, once this game is figured out there's really nothing else to do.  The story was blah and the side missions aren't at all that interesting.  This game is definitely not my fave."
404,1,"Just No. These controllers are not original N64 brand. I've bought and used more than 10 of these controllers. They work fine for a few days, but they all inevitably develop faulty joysticks and become useless just like the controllers you're most likely trying to replace."
405,1,"Just another FPS that has been slapped together.

SINGLEPLAYER:  The story is so stupid and, as others have stated, they do not explain ANYTHING.  You get grabbed by some team of cliche people.  The hot head who smarts off all the time, the girl who automatically defends you when criticism comes up, and the ethnic leader of the RESISTANCE.  There were times where I actually laughed at the stupid voice overs in the cut scenes.

MULTIPLAYER:  This sums up the whole multiplayer experience: ""THE RICH GET RICHER"".  The whole battle point system is so stupid.  Everyone just camps and hides so they can rack up points and then they get health boosts as well.  So you've got a guy that is harder to kill, hiding in a house, racking up points.  Then he calls in a chopper that DOMINATES the entire map.  Spawn?  Killed by chopper.  Spawn and run.  Killed by chopper.  There is only one anti-chopper weapon in the game and the little drone is so hard to get out and aim at the chopper you might as well try to lead the chopper with an RPG.  Basically it is a camp fest that ends in a godlike chopper reigning down fury on everyone as they spawn.

Probably the worst FPS I have ever played.  And that is saying a lot, because I really hate Black Ops."
406,1,too much lag and bad combat system it is mostly jut combo ing the hit out of people and then switching in. boring.
407,1,Probably the worst game in the Tales series.
408,1,Mine was sold by J-Tech Digital and does NOT display in 1080p!  I had a better screen clarity with 480p using the component cable (Red;Blue;Green + right/left audio plugs). I'm not missing anything. There is no switch or button to toggle settings. The white case has no hole in it to stick a paperclip through. In fact you can easily pop the inside components out with some slight pressure and examine the electronics. No switch or button anywhere on the circuit board. I wonder if some people think they are seeing 1080p when it's actually 480p. Maybe other sellers are not selling knock-offs and maybe J-Tech is. Maybe J-Tech doesn't realize what they're selling. I am not one of those lucky people who may have received a functioning 1080p unit. Now J-Tech wants me to pay for return shipping with tracking and upon receipt and examination they will issue a refund. They'll probably resell it and someone else will have to deal with the same frustration.
409,1,I really had high hopes for this game as it seemed like a pretty cool game if it could only work properly... to bad
410,1,"When I plug in the mic jack it cuts off sound on the left headset.  Thinking my Sound Blaster audio card had gone bad, I disabled it and re-enabled my onboard audio, same thing. When the stereo jack and mic are plugged in at the same time the left headset sound just cuts off.  When I unplug the mic jack, the headset sounds return to normal.  I checked all sound levels and settings including, motherboard settings, its not my PC

Reading other complaints on mic and left headset sound issues here and other sites; I've concluded that the mic - left headset integration has a chance of not working or breaking down some time later.  Refunded."
411,1,COD GHOST MULTI PLAYER is a cesspool of conscienceless hackers. COD Ghosts multiplayer makes Bernie Madoff look an amateur cheater.
412,1,The graphics are not good in the game at all. The weapons in this game are not good at all. The sound in this game is not good at all. The loading times in this game are not good at all. The controls in this game are not good at all. The frame rate in this game is not good at all. The perks in this game are not good at all. The characters in this game are not good at all. The weapons in this game are not good at all. The game is not good at all.
413,1,"The game can seriously be finished in 10 hours or less.  There's no challenge, no big twists and the ending is a joke.

Words just fail to describe how crappy this is.  There's no replayability in it either, cuz in the end, it doesn't matter if you're a cyborg or a full human; wether you join Pilot or fight against him:  cuz the end encounters are exactly the same.

Extremely disappointed in this game.  Wait for a few months when the game is $20 bucks; then it might be worth it."
414,1,"I tried... I really tried to like these games.... but they stink, too arcade and childish for me to enjoy, seen it's day, buy something modern like Bioshock 3."
415,1,"I bought this product with the intent to use it for my online Battlefield 2 game.
The product was shipped fast, and it is as described. I am very happy for the choice I made.

this is an update:  my mouse doesn't work properly anymore. It randomly disconnects/freezes and won't work until I reboot my computer (or I put it on sleep mode and restart my computer again). I think this is a clear indication of a Software/driver issue, not Hardware.  I am using Win 7, 64bit.

Apart from this issue I love my mouse. Its a great product and worked flawlessly until this issue. The issue became so frequent now (sometimes after 5-10 minutes of use) that I cannot use my mouse anymore. I just contacted Logitech customer support. Hopefully that will solve the issue.  I'll keep you guys informed.

I felt the need to update my rating to 1 star. Besides having the issue with the mouse device, now I have to deal with slow Logitech Customer Support. It's been a week since I first contacted them. Last time I replied to their email response was two and a half days ago and I am still waiting to hear back from them."
416,1,"Hello everyone, first of all let me start by saying that I do not have this piece of garbage, thank god, then why am I giving it a review, well here is the reason, and I hope it helps.

I am the owner of a MAIL BOXES ETC. franchise and as you may know we handle a variety of shipping services such as UPS and Fedex, so everyday a lot of packages come in and out of the store, but the ones that come very single day are the return for service xbox 360 system.

In a regular week people come in and send their junk, I mean XBOX, to get fixed and they doit with the return service Microsoft offers, so they don't have to pay anything, after all, they already got robbed with the system, and as I was telling you, in a week we get around 20 to 30 systems to send back, and some people come back to resend the one they already got fixed about 2 or 3 times after the first service. So I have asked people what is the problem with their Xbox, some have told me that I just stop running, others that it burned up after a few hours of game play and my favorite, after having it for 2 months the image is white and black.

What I am traying to say is that do not waste you hard earned cash in junk, get a PS2 OR PS3, if it is in your budget, and anjoy with out the worry of having to get your system fixed after 5 minutes of play time, I have had my ps2 since 2000 and still works great, as my PS3 wich I have had for a year now, and now problems at al even afater 10 hours of play time.

So In conclusion stay away form the xbox AT ALL COST!!!!!"
417,1,"I could write for hours about how excited I was about this game ...
I could also write for hours about how let down I was when I played it.
I could write for hours about how much I wanted the game to end so many times...

I won't because this game robbed me of enough of my time - as a LONG TIME fan of horror and survival games... don't waste your time with this game."
418,1,"I only recieved the game box :( No disc, box was broken."
419,1,"I'll start on the low notes and end on the very few high notes.
I agree with everyone else on this. There is NO way these screenshots are from the PC version. I have an excellent video card that makes Oblivion and Fallout look amazing but this looks like a rip off of GTA3. That includes the poor graphics, clunky controls and no mouse use on ESC screens??!!
Character Design: This was a joke. What's the point of going through all that tweaking and refining of the character if you won't see that detail once the game starts? Even though it allowed more freedom than most games, it was very limited for such a new game.
Save/Loads: I was in the beginning of the game and was about to test how far I could jump or fall and saved before doing it. I died and was sent all the way back to the prison? What's the point of a save system if it doesn't let you load where you saved?
Music: YES, it has become a staple of the free roaming shooter. It was highly dominated by music that I really don't listen to. It was like 20 yr olds in LA made the soundtrack and then said, ""what do rockers listen to?"" and they had NO idea so they just through together Pop and Rock from the 80's to the present in one botched mass.
Somewhat good:
I had no issues with clipping or jaggy blending of the environment. But the graphics aren't that good so it takes some of this spotlight away.
If you are facing the camera, and target a car or person behind you, you can throw a grenade or other items over your shoulder which was cool but it made the controls to turn around and run another direction very slow.
I had no frame rate issues that others have had. It ran smooth and fluid but that's a small victory today.
Sorry but I think this a $20 game at best and there's no need to buy it if you're already playing GTA.
Oh..They added drugs and Alcohol..Yeah...simulated drugs and alcohol..I don't get it.
Oh..They purposely left the Steam logo off the case. If I knew it was Steam Powered, I wouldn't have bought it."
420,1,doesn't play on XBOX One so now what?
421,1,"As a fan of Gundam. Not having seen much of the anime. Only having Gundam Battle Assault. This game is a mistake. Worse i heard bandi hired students right out of college.
Anyways
Horrible gameplay
Journey to jabu was better but the 3rd level is dumb.
In crossfire your a starter weakling of a mobile suit. Your the stupid GM model with & imo is a lame knock off version of a real gundam with a pilot helmet.
Youll be dead long before you realize it"
422,1,"The name of this controller is deceiving, while it sounds and it cool with the two Z buttons, as soon as I played with it I hated it. This is one of the worst generic controllers on the market by far, I remember I purchased this controller the first time in black and the second time in purple and I only bought it because it was cheaper than the original Wavebird by Nintendo. When I bought it in black it was $10 and in purple for $20 nether online I bought both in store. So I essentially screwed myself buying both since the black was from a local gaming store/arcade who I knew the owner from church, the other one was a store I went to before the other owner opened the arcade. So all together it was a $30 screw up on my own part.

But as soon as I got my hands on this controller and played games with it within 5 minutes of playing my hands started to hurt. Not only did my hands hurt in some cases my characters controlled themselves. I remember while I played with this controller there was a section in the Gamecube precautions booklet that I read that it was recommended to buy nintendo products with the official Nintendo Seal on products to get full compatibility and the full experience. Well, anyway the store I bought it from sold used video games, accesories and other related items, and the owner told me he had one controller left. So at first I was excited because (little did I know) I wrongfully assumed at the time it was a Nintendo Brand and instead it was this pelican brand which is obviously a 3rd party generic manufacturer. So since the store I bought this from known as Stained Glass Eye a local store in which is in walking distance of where I live, which didn't allow for returns and refunds though it did allow you to get store credit for items you brought in, which was pointless to me anyway. I sold it to a another local game store who did allow refunds and returns and would give cash or store credit.  I

Otherwise I do not recommend this controller for anyone who only prefers to buy first party brands and has the kind of money to buy first party brands accessories and items. I only recommend this controller to anyone who can't afford the First party brand (such as Nintendo).

I do have one piece of advise to those who would rather buy generic and pay a cheaper price make sure you be careful with your hands while you are playing your video games as this will cause hand injuries, unless you have a special pair of gloves to protect your hands. Otherwise just be careful and be attentive and stop playing if your hand(s) starts to hurt or if you don't like the generic controller, save the extra money to buy the first party brand believe me its worth it but it is not worth it to buy this Generic Pelican brand!

I did however when I took both controllers to the arcade I noticed the store had a Nintendo Wavebird which I bought and gave the store the two generic controllers and only paid $13 for it, so I did make my money back and repaid myself for my mistake. This controller is a financial and gaming mistake for any die hard Nintendo fan, who loves the First party brands."
423,1,Waaaaaaaaaay too expensive.
424,1,I have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo 64 and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues. The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion Pak.
425,1,"I am going to reveal the ending, so do not read ahead if you still want to play this game.
Many others have already posted their opinions here, so I will not go through the whole game in detail.
But as many others have said, the voice-acting for the Obi-Wan character is ridiculously, unintentionally humorous -- the actor sounds like a guy with a head cold trying to imitate Ewan McGregor doing Obi-Wan, exaggerating the distinctive traits McGregor's Scottish accent -- so even lilts in his voice are thrown into hyperdrive. (as exaggerated as the honker the graphics dept. gave to Qui-Gon Jinn -- yes, the bridge on Liam Neeson's nose may be somewhat big, but since when did he have Karl Malden's nose?)
The game is unfortunately lacking in the graphics department -- sometimes you can't see features on faces.
But onto the ending. The game is fun, with a handful of challenging levels -- mostly due to the swarms of droids that come your way and droids taking stance behind high-powered laser cannons.
But it's marred by a disappointingly quick and all-too-easy ending. The moment arrives -- you finally meet Darth Maul. Just like in the movie, you stand behind the laser wall and watch as Qui-Gon is struck down by Maul.
And finally the wall opens, you hold your breath, ready for a tough battle -- one that you may have to play repeatedly until you put together the right string of moves and blocks to take him out before your health runs out. But it's not to be.
Darth Maul is ridiculously easy to defeat. I beat him on my first try and in less than a minute. And you have to fight him twice -- as once you take him down the first time, he gets a new, full meter of health. So in less than a minute, I drew down two full health meters. I felt cheated, to say the least.
I remember fighting against Mace Windu to have to reach the next level, and I had to go toe to toe against him some 20 to 30 times before I finally beat him. I was expecting at least a battle on that level of difficulty, but it ended up being the easiest level of the whole game. All I had to do was slash at him and use some force saber twirls and Maul was done.
How in the world could the game's makers create such a lackluster, lifeless, no-threat ending battle? I was left extremely wanting, and if it were a movie, I would have angrily asked for my money back. I cannot say enough how disappointing the ending was. Even more now, the Darth Maul character cries out for a game of his own. One can only wish -- for this Maul must have been a clone or imposter to go down with nary a fight."
426,1,Every time I try to order this it tells me I cant purchae because this isn't available in my region...it specifically says available to United States Wtf
427,1,dont wast your time if your a tekken player... you won't enjoy the conversion of your characters in this game and they look ugly in sf4 graphics...
428,1,Item arrived in poor condition would not buy again
429,1,"Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.

What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!"
430,1,"I liked the N64 game, so I was expecting some silly sci-fi game with a plot that didn't really make sense or matter. But the gameplay was just so boring and repetitive, that I didn't feel like this was even worth the $5 this was on sale for.

On the rail shooters can be a lot of fun, but the levels in this game and the enemies you fight are dull. Just holding the trigger and strafing is all it takes to move on, except for some obnoxious controls during bosses.

The worst for me was that the game's co-op was very weak. Normally the game has one character you control on screen with the nunchuk while shooting with the Wii Remote pointing at the screen. But two player mode doesn't add a second character--it just lets another person shoot at the screen! There's no dodging or special attacks, just holding the trigger and making it harder to see what's going on.

Something positive is the addition of subtitles in multiple languages (including Japanese) but the dialogue is so hard to make out and silly that it doesn't really matter. Anyway, when subtitles are the best part of the game, it doesn't bode well for the rest of it."
431,1,"Ok let me say first of all I really wasn't a big fan of Madden 10.  I was a top 100 player on Ncaa 10 and Madden 09 so I know my football games.

I downloaded this demo just out of curiosity and let me say this was the worst 10 minutes of my life !!! This game is so bad, so retarded , so incredibly horrible I'm seriously having trouble putting into words what trash this really is.

I mean if by new graphics engine they mean a massive Cluster of people running around and you have zero control over what is going on ,  Then yes this is a new graphics engine !!  I played one drive on defense, one drive on offense then literally stoped playing because it was so PATHETIC !!!  The playbook will literally remind you of madden 93 playbook for sega genesis (  NOT JOKING I AM SERIOUS )  I snaped the ball 3 times on offense and was sacked 3 strait times without having a chance to even throw a pass !!

Like I said I wasn't a big fan of Madden 10 but theres no comparison here !!  Don't go out and buy this garbage just because you hate EA sports man !! You would be better of buying madden 03 for Ps2 !!!  THIS GAME IS A JOKE !!!!!!!

Also one more thing !!  If by some chance the makers of this game come on here and read this I would just like to say,  HAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA  at your attempt to make a football game !!!"
432,1,"WORSE CONTROLS THEN METROID PRIME HUNTERS
SWITCHING WEAPONS CAN GET U KILLED
MONSTER HUNTER DOES THAT BETTER
CANT KEEP YOU ITEMS OPEN
POWER UPS ARE TETRIS BLOCKS
HIGHER LEVELS TAKE MORE SPACE
MAKING IT EVEN HARDER
THE DIFFICULTY CAN GET VERY HARD
CHEAP ENEMIES
THIS GAME SUCKS"
433,1,"If you're looking to buy this for A game other than Rush the Rock then don't mind my review...otherwise, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! I bought this for Rush the Rock and was very excited when I received it, fired it up in my PS2, Selected Rush the Rock, was excited when it loaded, then was very, VERY shocked, As far as I know, they've replaced about every single sound effects, music, and Announcer, the Announcer from the arcade version got replaced with A NEW ONE! They even killed the ""What's your name?!"" Song, so overall If you're looking to buy this for any game other than Rush the Rock then go ahead otherwise don't buy this."
434,1,sorry but i couldn't get it to work.will not work on my dsi or 3ds.
435,1,"The single player is fun to play for maybe 1 time.  After that it gets incredibly repetitive.  You basically just play the storyline over and over again, but on different difficulties, so there is no replay value whatsoever.  Also because of the auction house where you actually pay with money out of your wallet, the game has become incredibly gear dependent, and tedious to play.  Unless you want to shell out another $20-$40 bucks to by somewhat decent items to beat inferno.

Blizzard fails to keep people interested in it, patch 1.03 made about 95% of the player base quit."
436,1,Waste of money.  Looks and plays like something from PS2.  I thought this was supposed to be a good looking game?  I couldn't get into the games atmosphere because it looks so bad.  Returning.  The fact that this and Skyrim share a gaming platform should make the developers of this game ashamed of themselves.  I give this a solid 2/10 lol.
437,1,"Over all the novelty had me excited. But just like other reviewers mentioned, the laggy and unresponsive controls kill this game before it even got off the ground. Not sure how this got through any sort of quality control."
438,1,"The written instructions for this game are almost non-existent. Instead, they decided to tell you what to do by writing it on the screen as you're playing. The only problem is that the writing is very tiny and in gold, which blends into the background. I don't even get thru deciphering it before it disappears. What's with that? I should be able to get the writing off of the screen by pressing a button, not have it disappear on its own. So now I don't know what to do.

This is just another crappy 3DS game. Thank goodness that I used my $20 Amazon credit to buy it, so I'll be able to recoup most of my money when I trade it in."
439,1,"Do you enjoy watching a hundred dialog screens between each 90-second game?

Screens like: ""Hi I'm Dr Node"" [press A button] ""Welcome to Big Brain Academy"" [press A button] ""We are going to have a lot of fun"" [press A button] ""first lets register"" [press A button] ""let's see your score"" [press A button] ""your score was ____"" [press A button] ""great job"" [press A button] ""try to get more next time"" [press A button] ""here's a bronze medal"" [press A button] ""let's see your score again"" [press A button] ""What a big brain you have"" [press A button] ""I haven't said anything informative yet have I"" [press A button] ""isn't this cute?"" [press A button] ""not tedious at all"" [press A button] ""you like having gameplay constantly interrupted, right?"" [press A button] ""it's like sitting in traffic!"" [press A button] ""you drive for 30 seconds"" [press A button] ""then sit and wait for me as I chew your ear off"" [press A button] ""and you can't even just hold down the A button"" [press A button] ""you have to wait for each text box to pop up"" [press A button] ""and only then can you skip it"" [press A button] ""okay, next game!"" [press A button] ""no wait i changed my mind"" [press A button] ""lets show you a crappy navigation scheme based on a school hallway"" [press A button] ""seems like the only qualification of the gamemakers who designed this..."" [press A button] ""was their agreement to sleep with the men and women at our HR dept."" [press A button] ""okay, let's play!""

The brain games themselves are fun, but the hassle of getting to each one exceeds the pleasure of actually playing. (This complaint is similar to that of Wii Fit, where each exercise is punctuated by intro and outro dialogs that destroy any rhythm you might have built up.) It seems like a lot of Wii games do this, which is why i don't buy a lot of Wii games anymore.

""Wii Big Brain Academy"" will be collecting dust on the shelf. :("
440,1,"Frustrating! Bizarre! Cheap! Confusing! Junk!

Wait ... beyond junk.  It's bizzare in how bad it is.  The controls are so bad I actually hurt myself.  The graphics are cheap and crappy.  The on screen instructions are even worse than the game play.  The interface was confusing.

Only two games are slightly playable, skeet ball and ring toss.  My son, who is 7, did enjoy these two for about 5 minutes only because it was a game we could play together but I highly doubt he will ever want to play it again because the graphics are so bad.  Instead we will go back to Wii Sports bowling and Wii Play fishing.

The volley ball game is UNPLAYABLE, very complex and just bizzare.  Just try serving, go ahead try it! Then try hitting the ball after serving, button A+upswing to set, button B+down swing to hit, shake the control like crazy to do a super spike.  Now do this all in about 2 seconds.  No? couldn't do it?  We gave up on this game mid-way.  So back to Wii Sports Tennis.

And how about that kayacking?  Can you even tell what is meant by the Wii remote icon over all 4 players, even though two players are CPU players.  And occassionally the Wii remote icons will turn into a Red X, even over the CPU players.  I guess those CPU players' Wii remote lost their signal. Back to ANY Wii racing game I ever played (Wii Play cow race, Wii-ware racing games)

Oh and what was it with multi player mode?  You pick multiplayer and you are shown 4 boxes with two Wii remote icons in each with no explaination.  Ya that makes PERFECT sense to me.

The controls are so horrible and unresponsive, this lack of response will make you swing, flick harder and harder.  This caused my arms to hurth.  No really hurt.  All the crazy movements I do with Wii Sports boxing, or Wii Fit boxing NEVER hurt my arm.  Yet M&M volleyball hurht my arm like a Little League pitcher who threw too much during a season.

This game did do one good thing, it made me appreciate all the great Nintendo titles suchs as Sports, Fit, Sports Resort, Mario Super Sluggers.  I longed for those games as my wrist and armed hurt from over flicking.

I wish there was such a thing as a no star rating because I would have given that.  We did get it for free as someone else was going to donate it to Salvation Army.  I may help this game continue it's journey to Salvation Army, however this posses a moral delima to me.  Can I, a fan of video games, contribute to the life span of this bizzarely horrible game?  No I can not, I think I shall have to destroy this disc.  I just imagine the look of excitement on a child's face as she sees this game waiting for her, only for her to realize she's been ripped off.  Ripping off children is as low as it gets in my consumer book, DONT DO IT!

Don't buy this or any other M&M titles unless Mars Co. post an open letter of appology explaining that it was an executive's 5 year who programed this thing, and he is now fired and being sued by the company.  In fact I DEMAND an explaination.  This is one brand that I will NEVER buy a game from again."
441,1,"I so want to get this game! I loved the reviews and I have been very, very close to buying it. However, despite lifting the activations limit, the game still needs online activation when your first install it. Please, please remove activation altogether so I can get it! I just can't bring myself to buy a game that I may not be able to install in the future.

It's a superb game and I really want to play it and add it to my collection. Please listen to buyers who don't want activations. Most of them are people who have been fans of the developer for years, like me.

Here's an extract from an interview with 2K's community manager, Elizabeth Tobey, who clarified the limited activations issue saying,

""Our other methods of copy protection remain. You will still have to activate your copy, and you will still need to keep the disc in the drive. SecuROM has not been removed - just the activation limits on number of installs and number of computers you can install BioShock on simultaneously.

As I promised that the activation limits would go away, I can promise that if we ever stop supporting BioShock in the ways you speak of, we will release a patch so that the game is still playable. I believe, as you seem to, that BioShock will be the kind of game we will want to revisit 5, 10, 15 or more years from now. I want my copy to be playable, just as you do, and so does 2K.""

I know that Elizabeth kindly promises to remove activation, but I prefer it to be removed now. I just can't trust that they will patch this out as I have been tricked many times before by companies claiming to correct issues at a later time."
442,1,"The Darkness is a first person adventure game with prevalent crime and horror themes. Interactions with the environment are limited, and the mood and feel of the game leaves me with nothing but disgust. Avoid this game at all costs."
443,1,"Suddenly it needed me to register to proceed ?
screw this. not gonna register to play a game for goodness sake.

remove/uninstall/burn"
444,1,My came broken.
445,1,This is an awesome game collection but the game didn't work. Which I was not a happy camper. But the seller was prompt on their response which is good.
446,1,This system is awful and so weak. Nintendo keeps milking Mario.
447,1,I did not like this game at all. I don't like communicating with still pictures. There is no direction for you to follow. You could wander around for a long time not knowing where to go and what to do. This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
448,1,"It's the same thing every year. This game has become and steady steam of revenue for EA and they don't have to change anything to keep on making money. If you're listening 2K Sports, I would seriously spend whatever it took to get another game like All Pro Football."
449,1,"Xbox One console accessories are still in it's inception and product like these are nothing but marketing stunts.

1. The battery doesnt even fit into the controller like a regular battery. The lid cannot be placed over it, so it has to be used non-lidded, running the risk of the battery pack falling out.
2. The USB cable is not stretch and bend resistant, which mean it will break under stress. Since their is no currently efficient charging dock on market using the cable provided is not reliable. If you do get a charging dock and try to use it with this battery it probably will charge extremely slow due manufacture non-compatibility. Like charging a phone battery with a charger of a different brand.
3. The battery life is random gamble, revealing poor quality control distribution. Consumers have mixed reviews, one claims it diminishes battery life over time, another says the console recognizes the battery to be depleted and others say it has lasted considerably long.

That being taken into consideration, those who purchase this product have a considerably high chance to be disappointed.

Recommendation: Only purchase this product from a trusted brand. Which is not available."
450,1,"I got this because I read that this was the Sonic equivalent  to Mario Kart. Hubby and I only played one race and gave this up. There is a small selection of characters to choose from. Hubby was disappointed that Knuckles was not an option. Huge downside is that you can not choose your vehicle. The vehicle comes with what character you chose. So if you pick to play Tails, you automatically get an airplane and that's it.  To me that was a huge downside and sort of the deal breaker. We found the course sort of boring. There is a commentator as you race as well. Drove me nuts, but hubby liked it.

Overall, skip this game and stick to Mario Kart. This isn't worth the time."
451,1,"22 Characters? More like 16. And It's not even wrestling, it's smacking each other around with pinning. Don't buy it, it'll only kill your love of the simpsons. It only got a star because the dialouges are funny."
452,1,This game is horrible.  Maps are way too big.  6 on 6 domination.  I saw zero enemies and captured 3 flags in a row.  This is nothing like COD.  Rent it from redbox or gamefly first.
453,1,"For newcomers, this is definitely the best in the series for gameplay...but if you're just looking for a new cover-based shooter, this whole series is more about conversations and storyline so you may need to look elsewhere. Not only that, but the big plot points and emotional scenes in this game will have little to no impact if you haven't at least played ME2, so there is really no point playing this game by itself. That would be like watching the series finale of a TV show without watching any prior episodes. Sure, you might enjoy it, but you're missing out on a HUGE portion of the game's appeal.

In the end, though, this game and this series as a whole was just a big waste of time for me. After devoting countless hours to the Mass Effect series (games, books, developer diaries, etc), being completely enveloped in the game's world and elaborate history, and giving this series more love than any other work of fiction I have ever come across, I've completely written off this game series and the developer (Bioware). The ending completely kills everything that makes the game's story and world believable. For me, it was just so embarrassingly stupid and crazier than anything I could have ever possibly imagined. Months later and I still can't get my head around how goofy and ridiculous it was. And with a story that dissolves into dirt in the game's final hour, you are literally left with nothing.

Collector's Edition: only worth getting for the Prothean DLC.

PC version: looks sharper and runs faster than the console versions, has hotkeys. No controller support. Requires Origin to run (which is a piece of software I used to support but have since realized it's like Bioware's games...pointless and unnecessary)."
454,1,"There is some important storyline you need to see but this game is crap other than that. Imagine kingdom hearts with a different totally random slot battle. That is how stupid this game is. Not the final fantasy that I wanted when i went to play this game. This game sucks and it is the last square game i ever played as a result.

If the creators of these final fantasy games want better sales, make the Final Fantasy VII remake we have wanted for so long. The fans deserve BETTER."
455,1,"I do not even have to play this to know it will suck. Activision crapped on PC gamers again and did a crappy port with this. The first review convinced me it was a hack job for the PC, too bad Blizzard is now part of this company.
I quote Vygramul: ""But perhaps the least forgivable aspect of this game is the lack of care in developing the UI. Most of it is confusing, made almost cryptic by a constant references to xbox controls. So here I am on my PC, and it says ""Select to go back"" and ""Y to..."" or ""A to..."" or ""RB to..."" This lack of attention to detail might, I hazard to guess, have had something to do with Activision laying off the entire multiplayer development staff."""
456,1,Too lazy right now to provide an in depth review. This is my least favorite FF game of all. Story is garbage. Game play is different. Just unfinished and unpolished.... unless you buy the DLC... and even that is turning out to be a extended turd.
457,1,"This game has some major issues. 1a. This is the SLOWEST loading game I've ever played. 1. There is an ""interviewer"" constantly asking the main characters. Not needed, and annoying. The same could be accomplished simply by having that character narrate. 2. There are ""choices"" in the game which allow two different outcomes. Most are - one choice is very dumb. Then they show you how smart you are since you picked the obvious correct one. 3. The ending is rediculous on many levels. 4. Much time is taken by the game while loading the next Act, Scene or whatever. Several minutes in some cases. Same when your character is killed and you have to restart that scene. 5. The main context, time travel, changes its own rules during the game - inconsistent. Shooting scenes are inconsistent. In some cases, you can kill all the bad guys in seconds. In others, it's almost impossible without being 'killed' a few times until you figure a workaround.  6. I found the controls to be lagging, depending on the scene, for no apparent reason. Replay the scene a few times, suddenly they're perfect.  7. I play on Xbox One. There is sometimes a menu insert showing the buttons to use for various actions (slow time, etc). The icons on those buttons are just plain weird. I never did figure them out, just Googled and got a good list someone had posted. 8. The characters were attractive, believable, and well-acted. Yet for some reason several had to be killed off, no matter which options you choose. That added nothing to the main story in my opinion. 9. Did I mention the ending? It takes many tries to play thru the final fight, even on the Easy setting. In my case, probably a couple dozen tries. And if you fail, you get no credit for the successes, you start the whole fight over. I've read where some players took a hundred times. What's up with that? It leaves a sour taste in your mouth - hence my one star. Did I mention that this game is unbelievably SLOW?"
458,1,"Somehow, multiplayer still pairs pro-level gamers with newbies to create epically one-sided multiplayer matches. I can't get anyone to play this game with me because a new player will loose in spectacular fashion. Look elsewhere."
459,1,Heard great things about this game.  I hated it.
460,1,"The game, when it works is ok, but it crashes and freezes so often, I no longer play it.

MLB is clearly the redheaded step child of 2K sports games. It consistently freezes when you try to skip the ""clutch moment"" cinematic and sometimes when you watch the darn thing at the end of the game. Freezes isn't the right word, it goes to the batting setup but the pitch NEVER comes, and the ""set your Xbox clock to some day in June 2012"" fix is crap, Doesn't work. It sometimes freezes when base running.

It is a reload of a yearly sports game offering. It's not much different than 11 or 2k13. Both are reportedly buggy as heck too, although I'll probably never buy a 2K sports game again, even being a fan of the NBA games."
461,1,"What a waste of money. For starters the name is absolutely inaccurate... this thing does not upscale anything at all. It does output at 480p, albeit with LOTS of artifacts, and stops working without warning. I've tested it several times with audio signal also coming out of the HDMI, and it makes weird popping noises and the screen will go blank. You just don't know when it will stop working. You have to keep unplugging and plugging it back in to fix it. I notice it heats up a lot too even when the Wi is powered off, so you might as well disconnect it when you're not playing. I got what I paid for and I guess I will have to order a similar adapter and hope and pray that it won't be cheap junk like this one.

Edit: I went and bought the Tendak version a few weeks later. It works flawlessly."
462,1,"There's almost no content to this game. No real single player (no EA, the waves-mode doesn't count), no community servers, no way to play with AI with friends, no space battles, mediocre unlocks when playing online, too few maps, too many empty game modes, and just no reason to play.

But we already knew all that.

My biggest problem is this game will be unplayable soon, like actually truly unplayable, a trend that's becoming disturbing in the gaming world. On the PS4 the servers are still pretty active, it'll probably remain that way for a while, but the online experience is a barren wasteland on PC and Xbox one with either EXTREMELY long wait times to find a match, or, in my experience, absolutely no matches found on PC. It's been this way since release day, and for some reason PS4 is the only one that's survived.

My 1 star rating is for EA selling me a full-priced game with $20 of content that is dead on release for 2/3 major platforms, and not even seeming to care about it. The graphics are amazing, the game plays well, and it is rather balanced... if you can even play it. I don't ask for much EA, all they have to do is add AI play and let me invite friends who can come and go as they please. Let me choose what maps I want to play in what order and what game modes to do, don't make Titanfall and Battlefront a habit."
463,1,"First off, I have always been a huge fan of the Fallout games, Including Fallout 3.

But, this game is horribly broken. It has been a very long time since I've seen a BSOD (blue screen of death), but Bethesda and this game have brought them back. The game reboots my computer constantly with blue screen crashes. I haven't seen those in 3 or 4 years. There is nothing wrong with my computer, except that it is a tad outdated. The drivers and direct x are all up to date and work perfectly with everything, except this game. The fact that you also need that piece of crap steam just to run the game makes it complete garbage.

Do yourself a favor and don't give Bethesda more money to ruin the Fallout name. Hopefully a company that knows how to program will pick up the Fallout series and go back to making great games like the originals."
464,1,game did not come with a 2nd disc and a key code but I got a refund with no problem.
465,1,This product was defective even before I bought it. Look up reviews for this PC game elsewhere before you buy this garbage. DONT BUY!!!!!!
466,1,"I know this is Xbox rather than Xbox 360 game

But I still bought it because I thought it is a great game so Microsoft would offer the update version so I can play in my Xbox 360, you know that right? Lots of games can be player in 360 even if they are just Xbox

I was wrong..."
467,1,The kids didn't like it and never seem to play it . Maybe other people would it but not my kids .
468,1,"I cannot get past the first scene because the main character moves around in real slow motion.  It's terrible. It takes her a minute to ""run"" across the room which is not very big at all.

I don't know what's wrong with this game but I know it's not my computer. There are 3 different ways to install it and I've tried all 3.  I tried changing the setting and everything.  I cannot get it to play right.  I would not recommend this game."
469,1,"Frustrating game. Lots of potential in the procedural planets, but unfortunately marred by gameplay that doesn't do anything well. Ground combat has no strategy. Space combat has no strategy. Inventory system is painful and frustrating to use. Material gathering is grindy and slow. Procedural creatures aren't interesting, and the overall structure of the game is ... just boring. Flying from one planet to space to another planet is neat, but the graphical pop-in mars even that experience. Overall, I wanted to like this (and didn't get sucked in by the hype surrounding the game), but it's just ... not fun."
470,1,I didn't care for this version of Luxor.  I have played all of the other versions. I  didn't like graphics.
471,1,"I was expecting a strategic, fast-paced, totally customizable experience including using piloting a mech and dueling it out violently with destructable environments, with some kind of strategy to mixing all the parts and choices in a unique, and perhaps rare way.

 What I got is a game that seems to almost be an extreemly easy platformer, because that is all you can do in this game is jump around in dull, predictable stages and shoot at your enemy with gattling guns until their health runs out.

BORING."
472,1,this one was unlike any other R&C game their were to many big enemies and not enough weapons to beat them I played all R&C games only 3 I couldn't get past size matters agent clank was ok didn't finish and into the nexus I didn't get past the first world I was really disappointed when I did buy it for full price and found out it didn't play like the other R&C games I love them.
473,1,"I had this over nighted for my son. It doesn't work, the charge light blinks when you play and charge. I blew $19 (shipping) and am now looking for another one. I'll make sure not to buy from them in the future."
474,1,"cheap chinese knockoff would be a compliment.  This thing did not work out of the box and was so cheap I wouldn't advise anyone to spend more than $1 for it.

Avoid at all costs!"
475,1,"Been playing the game since Beta adn though there have been other problems, when they ignored their entire playerbase to push a complete rewrite of the game to EQ standards they ruined it.  If you want to Play Starwars then I reccomend Knights of the Old republic or Battlegrounds.  If you want to play EQ/WOW with Starwarsy Characters then guess you will want to buy it."
476,1,"What a waste. All of the bad things you hear about this are true. It's obsured.

I use to love need for speed. They put absolutely no effort in this. After this, rivals, the run.. I think I'm done with you NFS. Guess you don't need anymore money so now you don't care.

Sell your company to someone that will actually give a crap please."
477,1,"Half life 1 was a good game and very challeging at times. This game is good too and you have to find the right way to get to the next level. Bad news now. The graphics require a very high graphics card and memory. Now the worst is that, I just wanted to play a single game and after I installed the game I still had to down load more crap and the whole game again and register to play a game I paid for. Now I am down loading Counter Strike in which I already installed. It takes me over an hour just to start to play a game here.

I am now going to look for Notices that say that I must register and down load the games that I have the disc for. Steam will not have me as a customer if they keep this up.

I would not buy another game like this one."
478,1,First off I do not own this exact gamepad. I owned the previous version which had a better stick than this that one had an octagon direction thumb stick. I don't understand how they could downgrade the stick to a d pad from what was basically analog thumb arcade stick. I only paid 15 for that version and this one is 50 with a dpad. Sounds like the quality is still junk grade as the gamepads I had quit registering because they are prone invisible wire breaks and also buttons going out. Pdp used to be customer friendly and would allow painless exchanges you didn't need a reciept. No longer the case. Their controllers remain junk and their customer service will exchange defective gpads but you have go through a pain of a process.
479,1,"I bought this game for cheap and still didn't like it. Very dull, secure this check point run a gun with out much need for aiming or talent. Just dull and not fun."
480,1,"I would not recommend this device to a PS3 owner. it says it works with PS3 in the literature and you can find suggestions on how to make it work, but it is not worth the trouble in my opinion. I got frustrated and gave up."
481,1,"i puirchased this game awhile ago and when i got it the case was creaked and in side behind the manual there was bagel crumbs in side it. it was very disgusting. After this experience i will probally not even look at buying from you again after this instance.
hope people read this and take caution from buying from you."
482,1,Right out the box the device failed to charge and power on. It did feel good in my hands but sadly it was just a dead controller inside a box.
483,1,dont waste time or money on this...there is no real mystery here...alot of lame puzzles to unlock things in game...very boring if your older then 13..
484,1,"it's not really action rpg...this is more of a platform game which is why i hate it! you have to do alot of stupid jumps that are not easy to do because the platforms are ridiculously far apart. don't buy this game! frustrating, not fun at all! worst game ever!"
485,1,"I ended up getting 3 of these as each one buzzed loud, got incredibly hot and died within two weeks, so they sent me a new one each time without even asking for the others to be returned because they know these things are garbage."
486,1,"This might be a fun game to play, but everytime I get to the title screen the game tries to connect to the server & freezes up.  I have tried at least 20 times & have now given up on it."
487,1,"You purchased this item on February 27, 2012.

I bought this keyboard and loved the looks of it and the feel of it, but I could not get Windows 7 to recognize it.
I downloaded the current drivers from the website.
I contacted the company for tech support, but got no response after 2 weeks have still not gotten a response from them.
The keyboard would light up but when I tried to type something I got nothing, it was like I had nothing connected to my system.
I tried USB 2.0 and 3.0 slots still nothing.
Not sure if I got a bad keyboard or if there is something else going on."
488,1,"Upon receiving this headset I followed all the instructions, including charging the headset for 3 hours before first time use. After having let it charge I paired it with my PS3, following GIOTECK's instructions, and found 2 major issues right off the bat.

1: This headset IS NOT NOISE CANCELING despite of what the packaging, and GIOTECK's website indicate. I had a neighbor over at the time I received it in the mail and asked her if she would help me test it. I sat at my desk with my PS3 and TV, while she sat opposite me across the 10ft. room. I asked her, soft spoken as she is, to speak to me while I had the headset active. She spoke just above a whisper and I could hear her clearly in the headset speaker. She clicked the mouse on the desk, across the room, and I could hear it in the headset speaker. This stunned me as I have been bothered numerous times by people who have headsets like this, which are not noise canceling, which pick up the slightest sounds in the room they are playing in such as their TV volume, their parents or siblings yelling at them, dogs barking in the next yard, and even cars driving by. On top of this, when these people use headsets like this it causes a doubling, or echoing effect when playing games. I can't hear what is being said in a game because I am hearing the dialogue and sound effects twice as it overlaps through the co-op player's headset. This EX-02 headset is NOT noise canceling with my neighbor speaking softly across the room. How am I supposed to not create an echoing effect for someone else when my TV is between my neighbor and I and not even on? If her voice comes through the headset it's guaranteed that my TV volume will be the only thing a co-op partner will hear.

2: There is also a recurring, tapping sound that comes through the headset speaker. It sounds like someone flicking a pie tin with their finger. It recurs so often, and is so loud that it causes the headset to be completely unusable.

There are some good things about the headset though. The LED lights on the unit are bright, clear, rich colors. The buttons are easy to press, and activate their functions nicely, and the interchangeable face plates are a nice touch, though difficult to change without feeling like you will void your warranty trying to pry them off. No instructions on how to change the face plates are included.

The included instruction pull out was easy to read and understand, in fact it's one of the nicer, easier to read instruction literatures that I've seen in a long time with my favorite being, ""Point barrel toward enemy"".

To sum up, this EX-02 headset by GIOTECK is an attractive, lightweight design but fails terribly in its usable quality. Many would opt to state that, ""You get what you pay for"". I would submit that if a company manufactures a faulty product at a low price of $20.00, then gets even 100,000 people to buy it, then toss it in a drawer when it doesn't function properly, that company just made $2,000,000.00 counting on those people saying, ""Well, you get what you pay for"".

Well, as is, out of the box, and brand new, this EX-02 headset for the PS3 has worse usable quality than an analog phone.

I purchased this headset so that I could pull it out of a bag, turn it on, and game it up without having to unpack a pair of headphones and connect all the cables and cords. After purchasing this headset, I find that I am still looking for a compact, easy to use, wireless, noise canceling headset, having not found the solution in the EX-02."
489,1,"I had looked forward to this game for months.  It installed without incident.  The problem I had was the tutorial, beginning with the elevator (lesson #4).  The booklet says to ""call elevator"".  I didn't have to because the elevator was already there with its door open.  Then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select ""basement level 3"".  Clicking on the control panel did not work.  What did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved.  Then I go to the very last Lesson (9) with the sniper rifle.  I could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial, and as a result could not play the game.  This game is loaded with bugs.  Don't take my word for it--go to eidosinteractive.com and look at the forums for Hitman.  I wasn't the only one to have trouble in the elevator."
490,1,"Complete waist of money!! Patches only make it worse, corrupted my system files causing a reinstall of WinXP. Constantly locks up your system requiring a forced reboot with chkdisc operations. This is equivilant to the Sony disaster! Dont buy this malware if you value your operating system. Its a complete joke and Ive was able to send it back to Amazon as malware and defective."
491,1,"How is this game still retailing for $57 when it is over a year old and you can get it used for $25...Before you buy read the reviews (from each rating) and decide for yourself, some people like it but a lot of people don't, including me.  Fortunately I bought it used, but It is not even worth the space it takes up on my shelf.  Its not very original, entertaining, challenging and it is just kinda meh, boring."
492,1,hard and fustrating ghosts too hard to catch they dart all over the screen each ghost has to be stopped with crappy wii gestures  you have too move the wii mote all the time too follow the ghost and when there is more then one you get hit trying too catch the other
493,1,"The game idea is a lot of fun. However, the game itself crashes back to the desktop sporadically. Very frustrating. I'm running it on a 2.5 GHz desktop with Vista, a GeForce 8300 GS graphics card, dual-core processor, etc. Fast computer handles Sims2 and ALL the expansion packs, Zoo Tycoon latest versions, Roller Coaster Tycoon, all expansions. No problems with any of these, but this Valusoft game won't work properly!
Healing the animals is fun, building up your ""estate"" is fun. But the constant crashing is a pain in the rear-end.
I updated my video drivers, uninstalled and re-installed the game and it worked fine for one day. When I rebooted the computer, BOOM, it started crashing again.
My advice, save your money and stay away from valusoft games. That's what I plan to do from now on."
494,1,Battery life did not change and they never sent my other battery
495,1,"Since the main part of this game is Infinite Warfare I will give stars based on just that. Campaign is average. Multiplayer is TERRIBLE. It's all small maps with terrible color choices there is literally no way to play with strategy.

I am still happy I got the legacy because it's not a complete waste of money. COD4 is amazing and even better with the HD graphics. However I can't say it's worth $80 to just play COD4, but I can say I would have been absolutely infuriated if I wasted $60 on IW alone. Trash."
496,1,Was broke on arrival.
497,1,"I KNOW I'm connecting the right way, but it won't.  I've connected the USB port to the PS3 and held the button for 5 seconds, but it isn't flashing.  I don't know if it was defective or not, I got it from CostBuy and Direct Distributor, and neither are working."
498,1,"Game was not so good, but shipping and handing was perfect"
499,1,It never worked. I tested it on two Wiis and three TV sets.
500,1,The worst first person game ever. So disappointed in EA and Dice. Worse than any COD. Worst Battlefield game ever. Campaign is bad and way too difficult. Online is okay at best. Seems like a game made to just make the companies money. Do not buy.
501,1,I paid $10 for this and still feel like I over paid. I do have a cool looking plastic skate board with no wheels. As far as the game I've no idea what it's like. Tried multiple times at different times of the day to get this thing to calibrate. It knows when my cat skateboards on it but as far as calibrating with the game forget it. Also if you can't get it calibrated you can even forget about playing the game unless you can.
502,1,"Just like the Wii console, the DS is being plagued with endless Mario/Wario wtc games.  Good god, I like Mario games as much as the next person but enough's enough."
503,1,As a long time fan of the metal gear games. I thought the phantom pain was a huge let down.  If you ever buy a copy of the phantom pain get the $60 copy not the collectors edition. Because I never the extra content when i bought the Collector's Edition.
504,1,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this game for the X-Box 360. The system cannot handle it. I have been plaqued with constant crashes and lock-ups. Had to order a PS3 copy in order to play it."
505,1,"If I could rate this I'd rate it 0 stars because this game is NOT appropriate for anyone 18 years of age or younger!!!! When I was a kid I loved Sims 2. It was age appropriate and I have to admit sometimes I'll still play it and I'm 25, it was always one of my favorite games. I wanted to buy this game and looked on YouTube to see game play of Sims 4 and to my disgust, I saw cheat mods for X - rated game play!!!! I am beyond mad because children are playing this game and looking on YouTube for cheat codes and on google. Children are now exposed to the lucrative acts that are on here....... you might as well be watching porn... they show EVERYTHING! And not to mention all the different positions and settings they have on that cheat mod. It's beyond sick and I hope to God I have informed parents wanting to buy this game for their kids to STAY AWAY from it! I hope this review was helpful."
506,1,"where is lineage 3 ? been waiting, stop putting out fad of the month mmos and make a game someone might actually play for a year or two"
507,1,"Does not support original xbox games (emulation software is ONLY present on official Microsoft HDD drives). If you are okay with this and don't want 1/2 of your system's functions, proceed (works as it is supposed to otherwise). I was extremely disappointed to discover this for myself, however."
508,1,"This stuff pack is not even worth a dollar, I was extremely unhappy and dissatisfied. It comes with a few ugly and useless outfits for your teens and even less items. As we all know its near impossible to find much content for teens so I was really hoping this would help that problem but I was horribly mistaken. Don't waste your money."
509,1,"This launched with some issues and EA/Dice fixed a few, didn't fix some and broke others. Latest update made it unplayable to me. If you have a Nvidia SLi setup textures will flicker to the point that it will make you sick. Sound goes out a lot, which has been an issue since launch. I don't suggest this game to anyone. Maybe in a few months when they get their crap together and fix it, it might be a great game. I'm waiting to play."
510,1,"Don't get me wrong, the game is superb, amazing, I'm satisfied. I got it from buying GTX 980 bundled. It's NOT FREE. I paid for it. There is no such thing as a free lunch, somehow somewhere somebody is paying for it for something they want from it. If Ubi don't make a dime just giving away to the GTX 980 bundled, Ubi still get the promotion of their company. Why? even if ubisoft doesn't give it away, Jack Sparrow will let you play it at day 1 anyway.

BUT... the Uplay thing that wannabe the same as Steam is the problem. So, I highly recommend any buyers to crack it if you just focus on single player. You'll see the magic, everything else will work very smooth after you stop the Uplay. Moreover, I tried to stream it with geforce, somehow Uplay won't let me in. Other ubisoft games are ok though.

And cheaters are everywhere. There is mini games race that some people finish it in just 5 seconds as top leaderboard. That's impossible. I challenge you to do it in front of me without the help of hack or cheat code.

And now, here is the problem. The moment you send a report for support, ubisoft will NOT help you. What they will do is asking the proof of purchase and all other things as if YOU are their ENEMY. Note that the evidence that some player is cheating is recorded and provided to ubisoft. Ubisoft won't help you for making report, they will first attack you.

I recommend to buy it. BUT, with that crappy support from ubi, do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it until there is super big discount. If you still feel antsy to play it, borrow it from Jack Sparrow, and buy it later on.

Far Cry 4 is a lot different from Far Cry 3.
-You can download fan made maps for your extra games, you can make your own game with it.
-There is co-op feature that gives a very interesting moments in every game you play. However, most people play solo. Join in co-op takes you forever. I've finished the game a couple times and until today I can only successfully 2 times playing co-op in PC. It's unbelievably sad. Most of the time, it's disconnected 5 seconds. For this, Ubisoft will argue with their made up excuses of course...

Yet, just so let you know... I don't have that problem with a 64 Multiplayer Battlefield 3 & 4 by DICE. Even if the multiplayer in Battlefield series has so many problems, yet I can still play it. Up to today I have more than 1000 hrs in BF3 and BF4 each, compare to any AAA title by ubisoft games combined hours average 30 hrs per game. Ubi games Price Value is not worth 50$ imo compare to Origin give away BF3 for Free to everybody last year.

And there is no point to buy the game if the supports aren't exist.

EDIT 1:
After the patch, I can get the co-op much easier than before, it's a good try. BUT.... there is always but, why? because it's Ubisoft. The Uplay prevent me use the MSI Afterburner to check the FPS and temp of my GPU. As soon as I turn on MSI Afterburner. Far Cry 4 stops working. Forget about recording your gameplay for Youtube channel. UNLESS, you crack it. Then everything will be fine. So that means, you cannot record your multiplayer experience with the software provided by your GPU. I got Far Cry 4 because of getting the NVIDIA GTX 980. So there should be all support cooperation between Ubisoft and NVIDIA. But not at this one particular game.

Again, you call ubisoft for this issue, they just say yea yea yea, we're doing something... I doubt it will be fixed by next year. Even the game Watch Dogs graphic at the advertisement VS real graphic quality now, after long time wait wait and wait, there isn't anything from ubisoft to deliver its promise.

Don't get me wrong, I did a review on Far Cry 3, it's a lot stable than FC4. Yet it was still the same problem on Multiplayer matchmaking part of the game if you read my review. How many years was Far Cry 3 made? If ubisoft have a good intention, the multiplayer issue in FC4 should have been improved a lot than the FC3.

Still, do NOT buy it at full price. 5$-ish is the right price for this game. Why? As the comparison. Battlefield 3 was ONLY 1$ when it was fixed thoroughly by DICE, and I spent more than 1000 hours of entertainment in it, Far Cry 3 less than 50$. Maybe I should dropped the star review on FC3, don't you think?"
511,1,It was a scam And under difference names too.
512,1,"If you play PC games because you love the PC game experience, FORGET IT!  This game is nothing more than the consolization of the CoD franchise.  PC's are NOT consoles and games should not be moronified (i.e. dumbed down to the console players mental level).

The multiplayer sucks ass and is completely unplayable unless you've had the opportunity to play the game from the early beta stage. They advertise their console-crack-smoking game-finder crap as the end-all be-all of anti-cheat.  HAH!  As a private, I'm constantly pushed to games dominated on one side by generals, while the other is all lower-ranked enlisted.  WOW! FAIR GAME!  Add to that the constant server-glitches, hackers, and cheats that supposedly ""Don't Exist"" on IWN - BAH!

Add to that the constant spawn-pwnage and sniping.  This game is no fun at all unless you are ALREADY a high ranking player (which you aren't if you are considering buying this game), or really, REALLY enjoy constantly getting spawn-raped.  I know that's what *I* asked Santa for!

As a long time CoD fan, as far as I was concerned, this franchise was close to dead after MW1, but I wanted to give it just one more chance. Foolish me.

I wasted $50 on this game so you don't have to."
513,1,This was not the type of game I thought it would be. It is just a matching game that is redundant and I really did not like it. The only positive thing is that you can play it and completely turn off your brain for awhile.
514,1,"... I simply play it all the way to the last mission and ... then I don't finish it and go play Assassin's Creed instead.

I confess that I'm a bit depressed at how badly this game ended. Really expected better from Bioware."
515,1,"Im a casual gamer, Im a 40+ year old who stated playing console games with an Atari 2400. I still enjoy playing and Ive easily logged hundreds hours playing my favorite games.  Over the decades, Ive learned to be weary of new games. Ive gotten burned before with games that aren't fun for a variety of reasons. My rule is to rent it first and decide if I liked it.

I broke my rule for Dark Souls III and purchased it. The story seems engaging and the graphics/music/atmosphere are really excellent.  You meet the first boss battle within 5-10 minutes of playing. It took several hours for me to beat the first boss. I realize that I just need to get good, but that isn't what Im interested in.  A game has to strike a balance in order to provide entertainment to a large audience.  The game fails in that department, every review quickly glazes over the it is hard part and spends most of the time heaping praise on the graphics, sound, etc. A fair review would need to state that realistically about 90% of players will not be willing to devote the time required to develop the skill necessary to even enjoy the story.  My idea of fun doesnt involve hours of tedious failure followed by brief feeling of accomplishment/relief only to be followed by hours of tedious failure.

If the goal of this game was to create the ultimate test of battle skill, then it succeeded. The 10% of players who can master this level of control and finesse will enjoy it. Speaking as a member of the unskilled masses, this game delivers so little fun that is hard to justify playing it."
516,1,"PROS:

517,1,"Ugliest, most uncontrollable game I've ever played. I'm happy I only paid $5 for it, I might as well throw it in trash."
518,1,"I have gone through 3 of these official Dualshock 3 controllers and they always wear out and break.  The analog sticks get stuck, the plastic wears down creating lots of plastic dust that gets inside and messes up the controllers, the buttons go haywire and randomly press.  I have tried to fix all 3 controllers because I'm tired of spending so much money on them and haven't had any success.  I have been a professional electronics technician for nearly 20 years and can tell you that Sony designs them with flaws intentionally in order to sell you replacements down the road at a nice profit.  This is the exact reason I won't purchase a PS4, their controllers started having issues right out of the box."
519,1,"...but I don't like this game at all. I'm a big Zelda fan and loved all the GBC, N64, GBA and GameCube games, but because of my age, I had never played the ""classic"" Zelda games. So I picked this up, aiming to be a full-blown Zelda aficionado.

Yet within a few minutes of play, I realized that the game was far too primitive for someone reared in the era of Link's Awakening DX and Ocarina of Time. There are no NPCs to talk to, no exploration to be done, none of anything that I had come to expect from the series. I am well aware that I was probably expecting too much, but whether that's true or not, I was disappointed.

Although I didn't find anything to enjoy in this game, I'm not saying that it's bad. I'm sure that it was a classic of its era, and those who grew up with NES games will probably fall in love with it all over again. But from the perspective of someone who relies only on what she has read and heard for info on this bygone time, it simply seems like a bland, watered-down hack 'n slasher."
520,1,Garbage. One of the analog sticks came in the mail with a small cut so that basically means you can't use this on TWO controllers. Instantly returned it.
521,1,There is a long complicated install which requires that you load software other than the game.  The game performs very poorly on my PC and many other PCs from what I read.  There is also an oppressive DRM.  Avoid this like the plague.
522,1,1 year later the left clicker broke....$60 down the drain switched to Razer after it died kinda small as well even after customizing it.
523,1,"One of the few games I've ever purchased that I just couldn't finish.  And I gave this at least a few days worth of effort before giving up.  I think one of the biggest annoyances was the lack of variation in enemies.  It seemed to take forever to reach a new type of enemy, and then they'd just be some small variation on everyone I was already fighting.  A little bit faster, a little more health.

I never felt driven by the story.  In fact, now that it's been a year or so, I don't even remember what it was anymore.  But I remember at the time, just not caring that much.  I could possess rats, though...and that's about all that really stood out as cool to me.

Another annoying part for me is that you never speak in the game.  Everyone else does, but you're totally silent, which makes you feel like you're more watching than playing the game.  But then again, that was brilliantly pulled off in Half Life.  In any event, it stood out to me, and the game environment just feels tortuously sterile, partly because of that."
524,1,"I was extremely excited when this game first came out, but man did everything go wrong. It turned out that I needed to install about 15 GB of info from online. Why wasn't it on discs? And through Steam? Ridiculous. I never even got to play it because my computer wouldn't be able to take it, and neither would I. The WORST part is that I couldn't return it once opened. It enraged me so much that I just threw the whole $50 game with a used activation code for a Steam account in the trash. I just want the Creative Assembly to see how negative the reviews on places like Amazon are so they know what we don't want- outrageous copy protection. Now CA will get NO money and angry customers. Smart investment, guys. I have deep fears for Shogun II Total War in 2011. If it turns out like this, we can all safely boycott anything else by CA, or any other protection mad company, forever."
525,1,I must've drew a few hundred circles in the sky for the sun to come out at Kamiki village and it never worked. The little bug voice got annoying even after my circles became perfection. Still no sun??? I can only rate this game 1 star. It was interesting until I got to the dead zone. I guess the people who gave it 5 stars never made it pass the freaking circle stage. Hate it.
526,1,This is in French so I am returning this....
527,1,"my 9yrs old daughter didn't play with it for more then 10 min she was bored, she told me she went in the garden fiding herself doing nothing and the game did not attract her like other mistery and hidden objects"
528,1,"I'm sure this game is fairly good.  That said, I need to issue a notice and warning to all potential future buyers of this product.

It is not by fault of any seller really.  It seems to be with the game publisher and manufacturer.  Ubisoft is not known for customer support as they don't really believe in it.  Quality control for most if not all of their products seem non-existant.

Do a thorough internet search and you'll get a feel that about 25-35% of people cannot install this game due to faulty manufacturig processes.  So be warned."
529,1,"Love the game BUT if you spend the money for the Anniversary Edition be aware that while you get your stubs, when you go to redeem your 15 packs that you paid the extra 10 bucks for, you get an UKNOWN ITEM error.  Just got the game and installed it last night.  Reading message boards I see it's been around for weeks (this bug).  So I would advise if you are looking for the packs to not bother.  Wood grain case is nice, as are the themes, but not getting something you pay extra for, and evidentially something they don't care to fix is bothersome.  I won't return it in the vain hopes they will fix the problem soon, but I guess for the makers of the show, ripping off the whales is a game in and of itself.

All that said I love the game.  Great graphics and just great fun.  Just buy the regular version and you'll be happy.

Before anyone replies and tells me how I have to redeem the packs in the store, I know all that, it just doesn't work.

This review would have been six stars if that was possible if not for the developer con/rip-off/scam.  We want what we paid for, that isn't a lot to ask."
530,1,Didn't work to will
531,1,I hate this game
532,1,"Thanks 343, you didn't have to mess with the master chief series like this or in 4 . but you did. and you killed halo."
533,1,Please don't support this constant destroying of our games. NOA needs to be overhauled completely. This has to stop.
534,1,I like being able to save frequently and often and you can't do either with this game. Some people can't devote all day to play this game. I gave it away to a friend who can devote time to this game that I can't afford...
535,1,U cant create players n play season all the new sports games all suck ps2 was way better
536,1,"If you lose connection to the online server, your single player mission is kicked and you go back to the main menu. You will then have to restart the mission. I was 30 minute into a mission and lost all of my progress due to the Ubisoft server losing connection. Not even a checkpoint was saved thanks to Ubisoft. They are by far the worst publisher out there. This game has been out since November, so there should not be game breaking errors like this."
537,1,This charging pack barely worked for a month. Very disappointed in this Microsoft product. Do NOT buy it is a waste of money. I wish I could give it a negative star rating
538,1,"This could of been a good game if they fixed the terrible controls and other stupid things that were so grossly overlooked.  There's really no excuse for a AAA game to have these problems.  This game has motion control aiming active the entire time.  It doesn't need motion controls to aim, you aim just fine without them however you can't turn them off, there isn't even an options menu.  So when tilt your controller a bit your aim gets off, fun times.  A lot of audio is fed through the Wii U gamepad, pretty much all coms talk between the characters.  I have 5.1 surround sound and they're forcing me to listen through the crappy gamepad speaker?  Really a terrible, ill thought out design.  Again no option to change it.  Sorry if this sounds pretentious but I have a big screen TV too, however the game forces me to play parts in the tiny little Wii U gamepad that looks like crap by comparison.  No option menu to undo that.  The game also has a section where you're in a walker type craft that unlike every other 3rd person game on foot, you can not strafe left and right.  You can only walk forward and back with the left stick, and the right stick looks left and right.  Terrible controls again, thanks developers... The thing that upsets me most is how simple fixing these things would be.  They could turn this from a 1 star game to a 4 or 5 star game with a simple patch but I know they wont.  After playing this game I've sold my Wii U and the game.  I'm done.

Star Fox Guard is a joke maybe a 2 year old would enjoy.  Don't bother."
539,1,"Capcom doesn't seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment, not torture. The first boss battle is so hard I just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin. This is not my idea of fun! Don't waste your money on this crap. All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on. You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo, then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill (you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie). RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge. If you still wanna try this game, don't pay more than 5 bucks!"
540,1,"This game did not play on my Windows XP nor did it play on my older Windows Me. I only received the message that the ""We are sorry, but the operating system failed to provide the window to render game graphics in"" Upon further digging online, I found that this was a known issue and there used to be an online patch file to download to fix this issue but now the patch is no longer available for download. As such I was not able to get this game working so I was refunded by Amazon. I'm not sure why its still being sold if it will not work on the pcs it is said to work on. I also want to note that even though the game I had received was new, in plastic, it did not contain any manual nor instruction booklet. Yet one the Windows Me I was instructed to look for known workarounds in the manual. I don't know but my son was very disappointed in this game."
541,1,"Two different times I bought the Frontman guitar as a second guitar for the RB2 on the PS3, and neither time did it work. I had to scratch and claw for a refund both times. Is there some sort of defect I don't know about? Apparently. I will certainly not be purchasing a third."
542,1,"Dumbfounded by all the praise of gamers.  I hated it.  The combat is nothing special, and the plot is ludicrous."
543,1,"I put the game into my ps3 and it started by downloading a patch.  OK.  I got my Logitech GT wheel ready to go but to my utter dissappointment (and disgust), it did not work with this game.  I have half a dozen driving games (like burnout, grid, gt5, dirt 3, etc) and every one of  them works with the wheel.  I cannot even imagine playing a driving game using the ps3 wireless controller.  Well, on this game, I had to use the controller just to see the beautiful city of San Francisco (and I tell you, the wide open city is just breathtaking in this game).  The problem is you can't control the car using a joystick!!!  Anybody who says you don't need the wheel for this game has never used the wheel and thus, they don't know what they're talking about.  Without the GT Wheel support, this game is a lousy game.  Forget all the beautiful scenery...You can't drive with a joystick, period.
It is a terrible omission on the part of the makers of this game.  There is absolutely no excuse for it.  What was that patch the game downloaded?  Another car????  How about a patch to make this game GT Wheel friendly?  None of the 5 star reviews ever mentions the <no wheel support>  Are you out of your freaking minds?
You don't even know what you're missing without the wheel.  You mean you can all drive/race with the joystick, turn corners and such?

Imagine if you will, you're in Twilight Zone; you got a joystick instead of the steering wheel in your real car, and you're driving to work...You are all over the road, smashing into things, including people walking on the sidewalk; nothing is safe from the menace that you are (with your joystick from hell).  Well, the Twilight Zone it is, when I play this game without my steering wheel.  Simply unacceptable!  Grade: F"
544,1,"I bought this for like 8 bucks used at GameStop and I brought it home and played it. As soon as I started playing it I realized it sucks. It is no fun, do not buy this or rent this. I returned it and got Lair. Which is better."
545,1,"I purchased this thinking finally, I may have found a decent case for my Nintendo 3DS XL, since cases for it are almost non existance at this time.

Boy, was I wrong!

This is advertised that for the Nintendo 3DS XL, but the 3DS XL WILL NOT FIT!

Even on the packaging, the 3DS XL is NOT LISTED as one of the systems this case supports!

The pocket in this case that is specifically there to hold the DS system IS TO SMALL for the 3DS XL system!

Now I have to waste time repacking this and going out to mail it back!  And as we all know, TIME IS MONEY!  So I just wasted time and money because I was MISLEAD!

I did not expect this from HORI!"
546,1,Just did not feel comfortable. Unlike any mouse I ever had.... in a very bad way
547,1,i bought this game for my PC and have tried everything to get it to play but nothing works.they said it was for windows 7 and that's what i have. when i launch the game i get message saying that my computer does not meet the minimum requirements for playing this game.
548,1,"I had heard from a friend recently about Sonic the hedgehog (Sonic 06) and how bad it was. I haven't played a Sonic game since Sonic Adventure, and I grew up with the original series on the Sega Genesis. In fact, Sonic 2 was one of the first games I owned...so I had fond memories of this series, although I had been oblivious to the development of more recent titles.

I couldn't believe that it could be THAT bad, so I ended up purchasing a copy for 5 dollars at a local swap meet to sate my curiosity. This would turn out to be the worst 5 dollars I ever spent. After playing the game for about four hours, I couldn't take any more. Rather than continue playing it, I turned to youtube to watch and see if the ending was any better...as I simply did not want to play any more of it myself.

From a gameplay perspective, Sonic team truly botched this attempt. The camera is horrible, and controlling Sonic has never felt more sickening. Sonic can no longer rev up for a speed boost, and his movements feel jittery. Because of poor control, dying is common and frustrating because of the game's absolutely absurd loading times. I would predict about 10% of this game's length could be entirely loading screens...no joke.

The presentation is equally horrid. There's a lot of bad level design here, as even the hub worlds are way too big and difficult to navigate. Sonic and his friends are all here, poorly rendered and animated. Disturbingly, Sonic team decided to place these odd, furry, mascots alongside realistic looking human beings. If that weren't bad enough, Sonic even has a ""romantic"" relationship with one of these humans. The contrast here is jarring, and somewhat disturbing.

The story is absolutely insipid and the entire thing feels like bad fan fiction. The only fortunate thing is that the ending, which I looked up online, completely retcons the entirety of the game as if Sonic team knew before the game was complete that they wanted this to be forgotten.

In summation: Obnoxious controls, extremely long load times, a poor save feature that can make you lose lots of progress, bad level design, horrible presentation, awful story, and a literally forgettable ending...

Yeah...this game is horrible. One of the worst games ever. Period. If you were a fan of Sonic in the old days, this game will only destroy your fondness for the franchise.

I've been told games like Sonic Generations are better. Stay far away from this game, though."
549,1,"OMG don't bother.  Nothing has been updated from the PS3 version.  You still have to stand still to attack (which I had sadly forgotten).  If you can get past the terrible controls you MIGHT enjoy playing this again.  I couldn't get past it so there's $30 wasted (bought two, one for me and one for a friend so we could play together)."
550,1,"Because Microsoft apparently hired the dumbest people on earth to create their xbox live account system, and man the online support phone numbers for it, I've got to rate this a 1.  If I could go negative I would.

I purchased an xbox 360 2 weeks ago, and got it hooked up.  But there are some HUGE gotchas, amoung which is the customer support manned by people under the age of 20 it seems, cannot actually do anything, nor does Microsoft care that they would piss off an lose a customer for life and have an xbox returned rather than give someone the ability to fix a mangled account.

So my gamer tag and xbox live account are fine.. I can log in and use them.

But....

To redeem microsoft points, xbox live subscriptions or other codes, and to use the messenger service, you MUST be able to log into your windows live.com account.
But I bought an Xbox 360.... what does that have to do with windows live, you may ask.  Indeed, good question.

Msft, on your behalf, creates a windows live account for you when you set up your xbox 360.
EVERYTHING gets associated to that account.  Yes, you only want to play video games, but you will be forced to live with a windows live account.

Ok, so beyond signing me up for something I don't want .... what the problem?

Well, they ask you for a bunch of information that is none of their business and not anything they should have for you to operate your xbox 360 console and xbox live account:
They want things like date of birth, physical address, phone number, credit card info.  None of that they need and none of it they have from me.

But, and this is where it gets tricky, they have 3 or more ways of accessing an account password reset : either through xbox live.com, windows live.com, a phone call to xbox live support, etc, etc.
And they all require that you provide a date of birth.  It matters not that you have your name, gamer tag, and the secret question answer you set up (3 things that should be enough).  Nope, they require you provide information they have no business having.  So if you don't remember what fake birthdate you gave them, you maybe screwed.

I can only recommend you don't bother with XBox Live and Microsoft Points at all.  The xbox 360 may be a decent console, but the whole live/points infrastructure and idiotic management is beyond incompetent in design and quality of customer support.  It makes the horrid Dell customer support system look good by comparison."

560,1,First bad tom clancy game ive played.  I love RTS games and all his other stuff but this by no means worked out.  Voice needs to repeat 100 times to work by then you are dead. Shame was a good idea.
561,1,"The psp was not as described. Was not in ""good"" condition. It was riddled with scratches and stains. Also fingerprints and  and dust and smudges were inside the PSPs screen cause I couldn't wipe them off."
562,1,"I purchased this via Amazon and it loaded fine! I just bought a new pc and this was a very good game. The story line was impressive and while I found the controls a bit awkward, I soon found that not to be a problem.

Then, my new pc had an issue and the techs told me that I needed to refresh my system. Not an issue as I could surely re-load this. Yeah, right.

I was able to get my pc up and running and decided to reload Homefront. When I put in the purchase code, I received a ""Duplicate Record Error"" and it suggested I contact Steam. I did contact them. This proved to be nothing more than a lesson in patience. Their customer service and support is simply a series of emails. You do not talk to anyone. I sent them all the data I had about the purchase from Amazon. This was fruitless.

As a result, I simply gave up. Steam's support is simply designed to frustrate the user until they simply give up. That was my take-away from all of this. As a result, and I told them this when THEY closed my ticket out, that I would N-E-V-E-R purchase another Steam product again no matter what. It is not worth the aggravation. No offense to Amazon's Customer Support but they were of no real help either.

I liked the game. It had moment that were very intense and again, the story line was excellent. But! The support from Steam was anything but supportive. As a result, I would warn you NOT TO PURCHASE STEAM PRODUCTS AS THEY DO NOT SUPPORT WHAT THEY SELL. If I could give this 1/2 of a star, I would. Not for the game, but for the support or lack thereof."
563,1,Didnt work. It was loose and wouldnt charge my remote.
564,1,I absolutely hated this game. The graphics were bad. I understand it's a rerelease but it was just bad.
565,1,The plot of the game is horible.  You die way to easy in it.  You can't play it in Steam.  It has no cheat codes.  The game sucks.
566,1,"I'll cut right to the chase, this game is a bore.  It is utterly visually stunning, but aside from that, it's a total bore to play.
I know, you're thinking ""But it's ROCKSTAR games! They made those awesome GTA games I love so much!"" - Let me clear this up: not everything Rockstar makes is a gem.  Not everything they make plays like GTA.  It may LOOK like it should, but that doesn't mean it does or will.
This game looks AMAZING: the people's faces and the environment is easily the most-detailed to date.  BUT: You can't do SQUAT.  Oh look at that amazingly huge city!  Wouldn't it be nice to explore it?  Sure - go explore.  But just don't touch or open or interact or DO anything.  All you can do, is stick to the ""Script"" - you go here, look around in a confined area, talk to some people, that's it.  Repeat that over and over.  It's boring.
All you do - well, 90% of what you do, is sit and ask people questions and try to determine if they're lying or not.  It LOOKS cool, but the novelty wears off quickly.  It also doesn't matter in the least if you choose right or wrong during the interviews (you can choose if someone is telling the truth, if you have ""doubt"", or if they are lying): You just continue on with the game.  Next interview.  It's shamefully dull.
There are some minor chase scenes or action bits - but too far and few if you ask me.  The fact that this game is so gorgeous but that you can actually DO so little is mind-numbingly annoying.
Not to mention - this game is THREE (3) discs!!!  Have you ever heard of that before?  I haven't had to switch discs on something since my old Commodore 128 days!!  (Yeah we had the 128, not the 64).
---
Please, do yourself a favor and PASS on this game.  I'm glad I bought this cheap and used or else I'd be more upset than I am already!!!

* UPDATE * : I'm giving this 1 star.  It deserves it.  I stopped playing.  It's just such a bore."
567,1,"It took me 12 days to sort out the missing 3-month Unlimited subscription stuff. After that, the game stops in the MIDDLE OF THE GAME with a CONNECTION ERROR. WTF, Ubisoft?! You are ruining fun for kids, and there is only so many times you can go though a broken dance game before putting it off."
568,1,"THIS IS A COMMENTARY ON ALL THE 1-STAR REVIEWS I HAVE READ ON THIS WEB SITE

If you agree with the below, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards.

Personally, I said ""take a hike, Blizzard"" by not buying Diablo 3. As a matter of fact, having been burnt by the horrible game of Star Wars: The Old Republic, I did not even buy Mass Effect 3 (I read gamers' reviews first and it turns out not buying it was a good decision) and, most certainly, I will never preorder ANY game (no matter how much I want to preorder X-COM: Enemy Unknown).

Over the last 5 years or so, game publishers have repeatedly lied to us, created incredible hype around their products, raised their prices to unbelievable, unprecedented levels and sold us TRASH... and WE bought said trash. It is time we all learned our lessons and collectively started doing a few things:

- Deliberately ignore all game advertisements as well as all pre-launch statements, comments, promises and previews by game developers or their puppets such as GameSpot (would GameSpot give D3 a bad preview/review when D3 ads paid by Activision/Blizzard are all over the GS site?);

- Never pre-order anything, ever; Just don't. Ever;

- Never buy ANY game until a couple of months have passed since launch date. Why? Not only because there may be some foolish, nave, trusting romantics who buy and review it before you but also because if no-one rushes to pay $70-80 for their (potentially trash) games, then in two months' time the price (in view of low demand) will have to drop to more reasonable levels of $40-50 or even less.

If we do this enough game publishers will have to change their unethical practices.

Video gaming (and especially computer gaming as opposed to console gaming) used to be a true art form and the games stimulated your mind and spirit.

The games of the last half decade have grown increasingly dumbed-down, streamlined, simplified, trivialized; they have turned into mainstream Hollywood assembly line of mass-produced garbage. Most of these games stimulate nothing but your mousing or button-mashing fingers and in the process insult your intelligence.

It is time to say to game publishers:

- We want OUR gaming back;
- You will not tell us what's good and force it down our throats until we like it;
- We will buy what we want and we refuse to buy what we DON'T want no matter how much YOU think we should like it;

It is time the gaming community stood up to the tyranny of Activisions, EAs and the like.

If you agree with the above, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards."
569,1,"Save your money and go get world of Warcraft. The game is buggy, laggy and has almost no support. It isn't worth the time or money in my opinion,"
570,1,"This game desperately wants to be like Tactics Ogre, and Final Fantasy Tactics (two games I adore), but fails miserably.  The mechanics of this game are so bad I don't even know where to begin.

The developers thought they'd do something ""new"" and have it time-based, similar to Tactics Ogre, but it doesn't work at all.  For every one move you make, the enemy gets about six turns.  It's totally unbalanced.

Your characters can either be killed, or they retreat, which isn't bad, but the developers decided to make you LOSE YOUR ITEMS unless you decide to waste a turn and pick them back up.  You can lose anything including your WEAPON and ARMOR.  Does upgrading a weapon and then losing it, only to have to buy it again sound fun?  This happens constantly, to the point where I just rage quit.

Levels are meaningless and just give you a marginal health gain and the capacity to carry more weight.  Part of what makes SRPG's fun is training your units and leveling them up, making them stronger.  This game doesn't have that, and it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it.

Aside from that, there's way too much dialogue, bad camera angles, and the battles frequently get interrupted by a screen that transitions to the next day, something that's totally pointless and annoying, and it disrupts the flow of the game completely."
571,1,"I put the CD in the drive, but nothing happened.  Seems to happen a LOT more than it used to."
572,1,I had to remove this skin from my controller after a week of using it because the stickers just would not stay stuck down on the controller and they were very uncomfortable and annoying.
573,1,"Good product but flawed (I may have simply received a defective product, 1 in a million, eh?). Here is a BIG complaint with this mouse, the ""trigger"" on the top left and right buttons is a hair trigger setup which cannot be changed. You think that's good? Not really so because the slightest touch on the right button activates it and regardless of what you have it set to do, reload your weapon, throw a grenade, etc., it stops the primary action and does the secondary, and, as the primary action is almost always (the left button) really urgent like shooting something, guess what ... yup ... you got it ... you stop shooting and activate the secondary action, and if your opponent is any good you are dead. I grew to HATE this mouse over a couple weeks of use. And, btw, we almost never leave 1 star reviews."
574,1,"I remember liking it as a kid but now I realize how terrible it was, how are you gonna make a mortal kombat game and NOT have the insane amounts of blood and guts and balls to the wall fatalities?, it's just like how the mortal kombat flicks from the 90's had NONE of the brutal fatalities and NONE of the blood and guts, it's just sad. it's a good thing that MK9 and MKX went back to the borderline AO rated roots"
575,1,"i love the concept, but the sports equipment when you put the clicker in won't stay in so it is hard to use when the clicker keeps falling out."
576,1,"The game is terrific until you reach one of the game breaking glitches with which the game abounds. By game breaking I mean you can't progress in the story at all. There are several of them that have been reported and I've just experienced one of them for the second time. The A new direction quest glitches (not all the time) where you can't turn in the quest. You can't proceed and you're basically stuck until its fixed. There was a similar bug in the original BL, and they never fixed it and I've got no expectation they'll fix this one. So if it happens you'll have spent maybe 10-15 hours in the game and be completely stuck. For those of you considering buying this piece of quality control reject then google the game breaking glitches that have already been reported...and by the way as of the date of this review they haven't fixed a blasted one of them."
577,1,"This was one game that I remotely enjoyed in the arcade, but unfortunately what made the game worth its while was the gun. The gun was the whole attraction of the game, which was otherwise just a dull shoot-em-up.
But my question is why? Why repackage a game that was clearly marked for the Arcades with the extra guns and what-not. Yes, Playstation has had some success in repackaging some of the arcade games for play at home, and yes thay have made great games with shooter attributes without the gun, but if they were to re-package a shooter game where people have gotten used to using a gun in the arcade for Playstation-2, they should (and could) have gave us some sort of a gun for just a few dollars extra and at least made it worth its while."
578,1,"This game is just depressingly bad. The entire game is built around an auction house that to the very core is featureless and hard to use. You are limited to 3 filters on an item search. You cannot filter by those search filters. You cannot filter by bid value or duration left.

The game is designed around a cookie cutter for total morons.

Basically Blizzard tells you how to play the game every step of the way. How to build your character. What stats you should gear for, what skills to use, etc.

They have consistently let exploiters go unpunished, while at the same time nerfing legitimate player builds citing that they are too powerful.

The economy is so inflated due to only being able to post 10 items every 3 days on the auction house. THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL DESIGN. Blizzard wants to encourage people not to play their game legitimately rather than spend their money in the RMAH buying items.

The final difficulty mode (Inferno) is designed so that players brick wall upon entering every new act. This too is done to intentionally force players to visit the auction house (RMAH or otherwise, it is impossible to collect the gear necessary to advance.)

Overall, a low quality game. I give it 1/5 stars."
579,1,"I've been playing Civilization as long as I can remember, and this is by far the worst one they every made. AI is childish, and the only way you can win is through war. Graphics are very cartoony, like they made this game for children. City layout was just lazy and the worst mistake they ever made. If they even have the guts to make another game, I doubt I'll buy it."
580,1,"UPDATE! see the bottom of this review

I'd like to start by stating my brief history with headsets. I've only really ever experienced TurtleBeach headsets, but with music I have used Bose. I owned Bose, the x11's, and the XP300's for a few months. I love the Bose and 11's, hated the 300's because they felt like my head was being squeezed even after trying to loosen them, and like the 510's. For 15 days before I bought the 500's and tried them but the interference was awful, plus they didn't have built in rechargeable batteries.

I contacted turtle beach about how tight the 300's were and they said this was by design, so I was reluctant to try the 510's. I haven't experienced the same problem however so I kept them. I have experienced two other issues that you should consider before buying these and TB should not be proud of.

Issue 1) Auto Shut-off: These headsets turn off if the source of audio is ""too quiet"". I have these hooked up to my computer via creative's DDL with optical link and blue-tooth. With this sound card any digital hook-up has zero volume control. Instead it sends sound out at one volume that cannot be adjusted, which in my case happens to mean that my music on media player must be set at 10% or higher to keep the audio level ""above the threshold"" for the auto-shut off timer. This is a problem because sometimes my games don't play sound above that threshold, which means I need to keep media player in the background just to keep the headset on. Which is distracting, and no one should ever have to make such compromises on such an expensive piece of equipment. The auto-shut off is non-programmable.

Issue 2) Audio: if you plan on using these for computer, when you're not actively listening to something, the digital processor at the transmitter turns off IMMEDIATELY, and takes seconds to turn back on. This translates to: the first few seconds of any song you play, or any game, audio test, ANYTHING is cut-off because the transmitter simply isn't on. To fix this I must keep music playing in the background at 10% at ALL times if I don't want to experience this. This headset wasn't expressly made for pc, but TB had to know that a $300 headset wouldn't sit at one console in its life cycle.

Remember that to use these for computer you will need something with DDL, and a blue-tooth adapter on the pc.

Programmability: Now on to the rest of the review, the reason I bought this headset was for the programmable microphone. See I play at night on the Xbox a lot, so I have to whisper. Almost all headsets don't pick up on whispers though, so I hoped these could be programmed to. They are, but it's not simple at first glance. Specifically you must turn up not the XBL and BT output volume or even the silencer threshold, but for XBL and even computer games to pick up on your voice you need to boost the equalizer. When you do this you will be able to whisper now. 5 stars

As for the rest of the programming options, I haven't got into that because it's complex and from the looks of it you can do almost anything you want. Very promising potential to adjust it exactly the way you want. N/A stars

Comfort: they don't hurt, unlike the 300's. I have worn them for hours on end without issue. 4 stars

Audio: I'm no audiophile so I can't say much. They work, and do have bass. They seem fine. 4  stars

Blue-tooth: this works on my phone, on my computer, google voice, and so on. Seems to work like a blue-tooth should.  Everything I've tried works and without interference. 5 stars

Wireless: I personally don't experience much issue with the interference on these headphones. Sure occasionally I get static or something here and there but it's never been an issue and some of it is to be expected. I have noticed that it does work better when the left ear cup is closer to the transmitter. 4  stars

Transmitter: I like the stand for the headset, but Issue 2 is a problem for me. I wish there was still a headphone jack for friends. For issue 2 I give it 2 stars, because I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to keep it working right.

Microphone: It's programmable in any way you want, what's not to like? 5 stars

XBL adapter: it works without issue so far, sometimes I accidently bump the button on it with my belly while gaming so watch out for that. 4  stars

Charging cable: it's long and it works, but you can feel it pointing down on your shoulder. Makes me worried that I might wear the connection port out one day from this, 4  stars

Data Cable: it's a little too short, you'll need a laptop or move you xbox to your monitor to use this. 3 stars

Surround Sound: it's not breath taking, but it's nice. Honestly I didn't fiddle with this too much and feel that it could be better. But again, I didn't play with the settings on this speaker positioning enough on this to give it a fair review. So I'll just go with 4 stars for now

Overall I'm happy with the headset. I didn't experience issue 1 while on the Xbox. I haven't used it on the PS3 yet, save for Netflix. While browsing on Netflix the auto-off did kick in, and it's F annoying. However during console gaming and actual streaming I had no issue myself.  I would buy these again, but if someone made the same thing without issue 1 I wouldn't.

sorry for the long review

UPDATE: 6/1/2014

It turns out, these aren't worth it. I'm playing Hitman: Blood Money on the 360 with all the game sounds set to %100 and the power saving feature keeps turning my headset off, so I have to leave my wireless headset plugged into it's charger just so they stay turned on. so everything I said before about it being decent is now debunked because it won't stay on. Turtle Beach screwed up, anyone who tried this for an hour on a handful of games could have quickly spotted this before releasing the product. The device is properly setup, i am 100% sure it is not an error on my end.

update: 7/26/2015
just wanted to add that i recently tried the elite 800's, and for the money it's a terrible buy. turtlebeach is now on my blacklist and i suggest you never buy without a return policy in mind. then when you do, if it even slightly bothers you or something you don't return it without question. they seem to be develiping a trend of products that have alot of flaws that any ordinary person would hate for the price."
581,1,"This game is absolutely horrible, they spent 15 years making the game, it did not live up to all the hype. They over advertised this game. The 2D versions were much better than this game. This game had cheesy lines, crappy weapons, boring levels, it was repetitive. Stay away from buying this."
582,1,"The game itself is not that bad to me. However, it is not worth the exceedingly long download, upload, and update times. I am not a buisnes professional in the least. But even I think it makes good buisnes sense to take those things into concideration before releasing a game to the public. Also the site you register the game at has fees for using characters after a limited amount of time and if you don't use your account after a year. I appreciate the fact they have no inital monthly fee. But if they are going to make you pay to use your own character, they should count that as a monthly (daily, weekly, hourly, ect.) fee. And they should state there will be such fees before you take on the long download time of this game. I think your time would be better spent on xbox (xbox 360, wii, Nintendo, Playstation) games that carry the Final Fantasy games. They are also fun, have no added fees, and cost nothing to play once the purchase price is paid. I am sorry to say that #14 still needs work and you might want to wait until they get all the buisness and technical bugs out of it before buying it. Perhaps it will fair better if they ever release it on another format (xbox 360 or NintendoDS for example). I would not recomend wasting time or money with the PC version though."
583,1,"Unless E3 has something spectacular for DS, this is could turn into this era's virtual boy.  Go to gaming websites, even the n-gage has a higher number of 8 rated games than DS.  Nothing can change the embarassment of that."
584,1,"Evil necessity if you want to game with a headset on XBL, i'm on my 3rd one and i'm easy on my equipment . The first time i bought this adapter it was 25 bux now up to 45 . Ridiculous ."
585,1,"I'm starting to think this is the most laughable excuse for a video game system yet.  The Game Gear was pretty shoddy, the Jaguar was downright detestable.  But here's... THIS... for only a couple of c-notes, you get this amazing system, that's like a broken swiss army knife that has hundreds of different tools but seems to randomly burst open at inopportune times in your hand causing severe injury.  Yeah, it plays MP3'S, but buying this brings you already two-thirds of the way to the best MP3 player on the market.  Yeah, it's a cellphone, but there's so many more elegantly designed units that don't require you using a headjack to not look like a moron.  Yeah... erm, it plays games.  Erm, some games.  A-a few.  OK, they're ports of first-gen Playstation titles for the most part, and while that isn't wrong in itself (70% of the GBA's library is made of SNES ports or adaptations), it's all in the execution, and with poor control and the lousy aspect ratio, it's already gone belly up, not to mention these blocky 3D graphics are so much more painful on the eyes than something like, say, the nice smooth sprites of an Advance Wars.  And there are about 15 games in total, out of which only 2 or 3 are any good, and even then the fatal system flaws lead to them being well nigh unplayable.  Multiplayer is wireless and adequately implemented, but that's about the only plus, and there's only a couple of titles taking advantage of that, too.  After such a stupendous release as the GBA SP (perfection in design if there ever was any), such horrible design is inexcusable.  I know this is practically flogging a dead horse, but the message must be made loud and clear, lest a huge number of children become disappointed come Christmas.  Please, just say no.  Buy a GBA SP for half the price and get your kid a cellphone to accompany it with the remaining money (see, there's two of the functions the N-Gage has already!).  It's time that companies like this taking advantage of heedless customers with shoddy merchandise be stopped.  Disengage the N-Gage."
586,1,"This game requires an internet connection to contact the Ubisoft servers to be able to play.  I have had nothing but trouble with my Xbox One being able to contact the servers to be able to play.  This is not a Xbox Live issue, and it is not a hardware issue, but Ubisoft refuses to admit the issue is on their end, or doesn't know what is causing the problem.  Their technical support is laughable at trying to fix this problem for gamers, and there are thousands having the same problem.  So I am unable to offer a few review at this time, and I do not recommend this game, at some time when I achieve reliable connectivity, I will update this review."
587,1,"This game uses STARFORCE.
The Suffering is one of my favorite games.
This one goes to charity.
-----
Do a Google search of Starforce.
There is a site with a forum and a thread which contains this game.
Several had problems; a few had big problems.
I believe there is a patch ?
I stopped reading, as I already gave the game to charity.
Just wanted to update my review for those interested in the game or having problems."
588,1,also requires the new computer with the latest in computer software...... you gotta buy a whole new computer just to play it great
589,1,"This has to be the most awful keyboard I have ever owned. The keys are so close together and very deep into the keyboard. I was having a ton of errors in my typing and the keyboard is HUGE for no reason. Takes so much space on my desk and takes much longer for me to switch my mouse hand to typing. The feel of the keys is also awful. Overall, just, what were they thinking with this keyboard? I have the blackwidow X and it is my favorite keyboard."
590,1,"I have played plenty of rpg and plenty of bethesda and this game frankly sucks i got lucky and picked this and fallout 3 up for cheap(used copies) and it still feels unworth it and here is why
Game play
This game plays just like fallout 3 but sloppier and besides they both feel like sloppy versions of the elder scrolls series and so i cant approve
Graphics
The graphics at first seem better then 3 but soon the glitchs start and you see otherwise
Plot
Thus felt so weak and reused the whole you get revived from being shot by a mob boss controlling a faction in post america is just simply predictable
Conclusion
If you have never played an rpg and want a cheap intro into how they work then get fallout 3 not this and experianced rpg players like me better just look the other way zero worth to this awful game"
591,1,Did not contain bluetooth hardware
592,1,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years now and this game looked like it would be fun but apparently I got a defective cable.  I tried 3 different guitars and all 5 USB ports on my new Xbox 360 Slim ... not a sound and the game keep telling me to turn up the volume on my guitar which after a few minutes got really annoying especially after I plugged them into my Marshall amp and got sound.

Overall, really disappointed and getting a refund ... think I'll just stick to Guitar Pro & backing tracks ... big waste of time!"
593,1,"Now before i start i want to say i loved Gears of War 1. With that out of the way, Gears of War 2 is a complete disaster. From the moment i popped it into my 360 Elite to when i popped it back out after a couple hours of campaign and a few games of multiplayer. I already sold it back to GameStop. Epic should change their company name to Epic Fail because they sure did drop the ball on this game.

Where do i even start? I guess i'll start with the campaign. It's decent, just a Gears of War 1 rehash, nothing more. Definitely forgettable. The dialogue is completely childish and immature this time around throughout the entire game. Dom does nothing but [...] all game, it gets really old after about the first mission. It just feels so clunky and thrown off.

Now onto my favorite mode and what kills the game for me, Multiplayer. What the heck was Cliffy B smoking when he made this game? The multiplayer is a sheer disaster. Instead of being able to chose what type of game mode you want to play you have to vote now. You can't even choose your team. It's like Halo 3 gone wrong. It's just bad. The shotgun, which was the best weapon and most fun in Gears of War 1 has been completely dumbed down and is now one of the weakest weapons in the game. This game caters to all the Gears of War 1 cry babies that sucked at the game. If you were a lancer noob from Gears of War 1 this game will probably be right down your alley.

1/5 stars, would of gave it zero if i could. Don't buy this game, don't even rent it. Save your money, Gears 2 is just a rehash of the first game that hasn't improved at all. Buy Resistance 2 for the Ps3, it's the best shooter this generation and the best i've ever played. R2 is easily Game of The Year"
594,1,"Sad, seems unplayable on windows 10"
595,1,"For a while, I was torn between purchasing Operation Darkness or this game, Spectral Force 3.  Both are strategy RPGs, and both are by Atlus.  I decided on Operation Darkness, and it was surprising fun.  So Spectral Force seemed like a no-brainer.  At first glance, it looked a lot like the wonderful Shining Force series of games.  Even the name seemed to tie in to the old series.  But beyond that, this game is no Shining Force.

Problem:  The control scheme is very counter-intuitive.  It's simple enough to move about the game terrain, but the attack setup is murky at best.  There are different strength attacks, depending on what button you push.  Of course, the game doesn't explain that, and the game book is similarly useless.

Another problem:  The enemies appear in stages and not all at once.  That works fine for Operation Darkness, because the maps are huge.  Not so much in this game.  You kill three enemies, and suddenly, there are three more standing behind you.  It's hard to coordinate attacks when you cannot anticipate the enemies' location.

Another problem:  The hub you return to after missions gives you practically no information, or hints about creating items and armors.  You find random junk during battles and you can create new gear after the fact.  But what will the new armors and weapons do?  Are you making something really powerful, or is it just more useless stuff? The game doesn't really tell you.

Another problem.  Let me get this straight . . . the healer in your party cannot heal himself outright?  You have to acquire a spell after the fact?  He has no problem healing the other party members, so why can't he heal himself?  That didn't make any sense, and it makes even less sense after the character dies constantly.

Final problem: In between missions, there are static cut scenes with dialogue, moving the story forward.  This is where the game likes to freeze.  Now an occasional freeze is forgivable, but not when it occurs on a consistent basis.  You beat the mission, watch the cutscene, the game freezes, you cannot save, start over.  That's unforgivable.

Forget this game."
596,1,"They are totally amazing and completely work, in other words THEY DONT EVEN WORK. Not even worth the money to ship them back for them to send me another piece of plastic that won't work"
597,1,"Install went okay...

Click to play, configuration tool crashes over and over - BAD.

/figure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a 2ndary launcher inbeded in the program files. /successfully launched skipping the configuration tool.

So that was frustrating.

Gameplay - BAD

First issue, Crashes caused by conversations with npcs, which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end, when it first happen windows gave a solution of a Mass Effect 1 Patch - which was easy enough to download and install but DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE...  Its completely RANDOM when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it, sometimes not.  LOL it literally says ""file not found"" and crashes, restart and Presto it works VERY RANDOM but must of restarted me 12+ times.  SAVE before EACH and Every NPC you talk to - to limit annoyance.

Cover system made of fail - pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward, and bad angles.

Item Cap of 150 /fail *blinks* if your already allowing me to carry around 100+items why the heck is there a cap at all?  And sorting the inventory out was a pain.  Games in general need to stop adding Caps like this, FF7 was great and you could hold 99 of everything.

Actual fighting/gameplay a form of torture clunky, clunky, CLUNKY - don't bother with cover its useless.

Land Rover - giggity, whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it.  Its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it, getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down IS NOT FUN.  Which brings me to another point, whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on EVERY planet.  It was INCREDIBLY unfun having to explore with the rover, when it bounces around like a weightless rag-doll on every little bump and don't have enough power to climb a hill.

Elevators - HORRIBLE you'll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides THAT ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN THE GAME.......
its actually a ""thank god"" moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game YEAH ITS THAT BAD... 3-5 minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so FREQUENT.

Sniper rifle wobble - Shepard on some kind of drug?  is he/she not a trained soldier?  Why can't he hold it still?  Even when you get the ability to add 2 25% weapon stability upgrades it's shake is pretty bad...  I'll never understand what was going through their head on this one.  As a amateur hunter i don't have any issue with shaking my gun like I'm hopped up on sugar pops OR WORST...

Story - Wasn't bad.

i think i might of liked it better than Me2, at least the end bad guy wasn't a ridiculous ""HUMAN REAPER"" oh noes!  - why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity.  Which truth be told this series lacks in spades.

Generally Clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersion.

Take note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous length.

It did some things better than Me2

For example every star system you go to has ""something"" to do in it.  But that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets with.

No Ammo was a cool idea, only overheating.

Ability to Sell stuff for Credits - this is good, but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying, and the 150 item cap drove me insane. - I ended with 9,999,999 (max) useless credits.

overall if i would of played this before Me2 i wouldn't of bought Me2 cus the genre would be dead to me.  Me2 is at least playable.  This is borderline unplayable, i managed to get through it by jamming to music in the background and reminding myself of the bigger picture Me2/Me3..."
598,1,Not well made
599,1,"This is the same story with Fallout 3, and it was no surprise that it was going too be the same in New Vegas. The irony of it all though, is that most of the bugs and glitches and freezing issues in Fallout 3 carry over into New Vegas. It's clear this company knows they have a faithful audience of fan boys that will regardless buy this game, even though it's a unfinished product. They will continue too keep doing this, because the game sells a lot of units at launch. And these so called ""patches"" that usually claim to fix most of the serious issues don't, so it's loss and loss situation. If you were lucky too get this game when Black Friday was around, good for you. Full price for this game? NO! NO! NO!"
600,1,"The build quality is improved and no longer squeaks and creeks when held, but the LB/RB buttons have been terrible on both the original and replacement controller I received."
601,1,"This is the worst game ever, don't even think of buying this stupid game, I got it for $10 & it's not even worth that, horrible game play horrible graphics, stay very very far away from buying. I wish Amazon would change their rating to include a zero rating, cause this doesn't even deserve that."
602,1,"I almost made it to the end of this game, when it crashed and corrupted my save game.  Since it autosaves I would have to play the whole thing over.  The fact the game is addictive and fun to play just makes it that much more annoying when bugs like this happen, just like they did in AC2.  Ubisoft's customer service is also terrible, and they are rude about it too.  Avoid wasting your time and money.

I did figure out a workaround, which also works in the other AC series games.  You have the find the save games file, which differs by your OS.  Google it for specifics.  Then save duplicate copies of the file periodically.  A mild pain but better than losing your saves.  You have to do it ahead of time, though."
603,1,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this controller , I have one and it looks outstanding.. The problem is that this controller is a bestBuy exclusive, and the seller bought many of these things cheap on Black Friday and is now price gouging and charging more for them than BestBuy does when selling at normal price. Don't buy from this SNAKE and just go to BestBuy or order from them and save yourself some cash..

http://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-xbox-one-special-edition-midnight-forces-wireless-controller-camouflage/7307001.p?id=1219265949449&skuId=7307001

Just buy from the link above.. If the seller wasn't price gouging I would have given this a 5 star review because I love the controller but I simply cannot because of whet he or she is doing.. Maybe potential buyers will see this and pick it up from besbuy instead of being ripped off .."
604,1,"The graphics are ok but not upto scratch for the ps3, races are easier than a drunk american college girl in mexico, the frame rate is slower that Corky and if you didn't guess the plot twist within 10 minutes of playing.......well you should look up hammers on Amazon and bash yourself with it because you are teetering on stupid."
605,1,"This is a really bad game on so many levels.  It is hard to give it any good marks when the bad things are consistently there year after year.  I hadn't even bothered to touch this since Madden 2012 and I thought maybe after 5 years things had improved.  WRONG.

Pros - You get to play a football game, but it could be so much better

Cons...

1.  Tiresome overly complicated menus.  EA wasted more time and energy on bogus presentation and complicated menus than they did on actual game play and real game improvements.  Play calling is horrendous now with the menus they have.

2.  Redundant pathetic coaching reactions to EVERY play get so tiresome, it takes that much longer to play the game.  I see Jim Caldwell on my screen more than my actual players and I really could care less what he thinks.

3.  Poor tackling and horrible physics.  It's sad that a game like NFL 2K (and I hate bringing this game up) is far superior at 10 years old and EA is still lagging behind and hasn't figured it out yet.  Guys look like they are drowning out there when they flop around.  Ridiculous passes and catches that are something out of a Matrix movie.

4.  Pathetic defending.  Played a guy online who couldn't move the ball against me except for his standard hail mary to Larry Fitzgerald to catch the ball in double and triple coverage, no matter what defense was selected.  Scored both his TDs this way with the epic ""aggressive catch"".  I'd really love to know how receivers in the NFL actually decide which catch they make isn't aggressive.  This was an absolute joke of an idea.

5.  Excessive fumbling.  You can breathe on a player and he'll cough the ball up after you're putting together a solid drive.

The bottom line is nothing is going to change until people hit the NFL and EA where they hurt...their wallets.  If people boycott this game and it stops selling the NFL will be forced to stop giving EA exclusive rights and some competition will be healthy for football games."
606,1,"This is the same formula they have been using for a while. Crazy fast game play and you have to drink 5 cups of coffee just to start to be able to keep your head on enough of a swivel to not get shot from above, behind, beside, below, or through a wall. With MW2 and MW3 if I saw a group of people I would know I'm taking out 1-2 if I had the jump on them. Not on here!  Even if I have the jump there is always someone else right beside you!!  Game is way to fast and the graphics look terrible. Cartoonish!  I love COD, but have been disappointed in all of them since MW3 and BO2."
607,1,Old skylanders contribute nothing to the game
608,1,this cheap thing did not work and im mad cause i bought tow for my sons and it never sync im better off by them a wred nunchuck very disappointed in this brand
609,1,I stopped playing within 20 minutes. The storyline is retarded. capcom should be ashamed they made this game. Hopefully re6 isn't this bad
610,1,All the mini-games suck. You will never play it the second time.
611,1,"not at all what I expected it to be, there's nothing to this game other than building a bunch of building in specific order, very very boring, played it once and quit, waste of money."
612,1,"i had to make sure i was reviewing the right silent hill because i can't believe how much people like this game.  i did like the first silent hill on playstation, years ago.  then i tried silent hill 3 for PC and the camera system was so awful i just couldn't stand it.  so i gave this one a try and it's just... boring!  you walk around, see some monsters, kill them.. blah..  shooting them isn't very fun.  gee, if i want to kill monsters, why wouldn't i just go play doom 3?  it's dark.  it's scary.  it uses guns in a far better manner.  so that means the only reason to play silent hill is to learn the story?  then why not just go read a good book or watch a movie?  or maybe walking around a town is fun.. but hey, i can put on my sneakers and walk around town!"
613,1,"This game should have NEVER been released in its current state. Its load times are unacceptable. Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation. Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1. This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6. FF5 freezes very often when you try to save. Also its load times are long. Not to mention this is the original translation of the game, so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game. FF5 just butchers the English language. FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times. It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever. The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience. Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance. Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology. LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time. Shame on you square soft, shame."
614,1,I was obessed with resident evil 4 so much I bought it on three different consoles but this game made me want to scream. I paid $80 for the limited edition and ended up selling it to game stop for $20. My biggest problem was the girl who follows you around and does nothing but die and steals your ammo. They use some the same exact scene from resident evil 4 an example a truck comes right towards you and you have to kill the driver. Do they we are stupid save your money and buy resistance 1 or 2.
615,1,"I purchased this game because my 17 year old daughter, who is fascinated with zombies for some reason and wanted the game for Christmas. This game is the standard ""mission based"" game in which you run around an island, completing tasks for people and killing a lot of zombies.

As I see it, the problems with this game are that the controls are awkward and the storyline cumbersome, and after about an hour, the game is repetitive and boring. I also didn't appreciate all the profanity with no way to turn it off in the game settings. I realize that some people talk that way, and that it might lend a certain degree of alarm to the game, but I really don't appreciate hours on end of profanity blaring through my house.

My daughter played the game for about 3 days and hasn't touched it since. She found it boring after a while too."
616,1,"This product was terrible and useless.. It did not fit properly, it had static noise coming though my headset.. basically a useless item. The best part about this was returning the item for a refund. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this item."
617,1,I hate of it cause i just bought the used one. I cant play with it.
618,1,I had a lot of high hopes when I purchased this updated work. I remember playing it when it was first released years ago and thought it was great. The upgrade looks awful. The people who worked on this game did little to make it better and just wanted to turn it out quickly for a easy buck. This game sucks.
619,1,I bought both games for Xbox one and PS4 at Gamestop. Xbox one version lags more than the PS4. So you are better off picking this up on PS4
620,1,"I cannot believe how horribibly atrocious this arcade stick was. I say was, because I put the p.o.s. out of it's misery for good, instead of returning it for a refund. Upon destroying that hunk of junk, I plugged in  my regular ps2 controller and dominated opponents that had only moments before put me to shame. The joystick was so chintzy in it's design it would only pull off the command half the time. I must mention that it was nothing like an actual arcade stick, which is fluid and accurate. Imagine trying to draw a smooth circle in an octagonal plastic stencil, and that's how the stick felt. The buttons worked fine, but also felt cheap. I honestly don't know what they were thinking here. The only reason I bought the thing was for the accurate stick movement that a normal controller lacks, but shocked was I as to how much worse this handled than my normal ps2 controller. Had I returned it, it would simply be re-sold to some other poor shmuck, I could not allow that to happen in good conscience."
621,1,"First this is an online game so it takes a very long time for you to download everything and get started playing. I was excited to see that there was going to be a change from Modern Warfare, but it really wasn't.

This claims to be a team-based type of game, don't fool yourself, it isn't. You are either good at the game or you are bad at the game, there really is not anything in between. It is hard to keep a streak going inside of the game and the maps just were not all that enjoyable.

I would have thought the game would have had more to it, but it just doesn't.

One of the biggest hates for this game is the extra content that you have to pay for. That stuff annoys me. Games like that should not exist.

*********
I was reading some of the reviews for the 1 star ratings, a lot of them are the same things. Team work doesn't exist, there is little microphone usage and the 256 players is misleading. Sounds to me like quite a few people are having this problem.

Wake up MAG fan-boys. Just cause you and some guy play the game for 5 hours religiously a night coordinate with each other doesn't mean they all are."
622,1,SCALPER PRICE! just buy the japanese version it is a smooth $180
623,1,"This game is beautifully done, with great graphics and very well-hidden objects.  Unfortunately, one flaw renders it unplayable under some circumstances - the mouse does not move all the way to the edge of the screen.  I'm stuck at a point where I know exactly where the object is (a hint wasted even confirmed this is, indeed, the correct object) but I cannot get the mouse to move close enough to select it.  I've clicked dozens of times all around it (and lost many minutes!) and still, it will not select the object.  Unfortunately, short of starting as a new player and hoping I don't get that particular object again (or any in a similar position), I don't see a way to overcome this issue.

Which is sad, otherwise, the game seems very nice, but it is simply too frustrating that you cannot do what you see needs to be done to progress the game.  I've tried a few times, and always run up against this issue.  I don't know how to correct it, so I'm simply uninstalling the game and hopefully forgetting about it.

*EDIT*
There is a way around the problem - someone told me the secret!  You have to start the game, then go to the main menu and uncheck 'full screen'.  Click 'okay' to resume the game (which will now be small and windowed, too small to play with how tiny some of those objects are!) and then go *back* to the main menu and re-check 'full screen'.  You will now be able to move all the way to the edges.  I'm not sure if I'd change my star rating even if I could (maybe up the 'fun' item) because that's such an annoying flaw.

So this allowed me to play through the game and the story (history) is great, the only issue... okay, two issues.  One, it's really, really short.  Two, some of those items are impossible to find and there are very few hints.  Seriously, the fireflies?!  Who could find that one...  well, I won't spoil it.  But save a hint for that!"
624,1,Doesn't fit very well. and I dropped it eventually and proved it doesn't protect very well either. Looks cool though.
625,1,These have been opened then sealed by third party not from manufacturer.
626,1,"I just threw $30 away buying the highly broken, freeze-prone PC version which has NO UNINSTALLER and is simply unplayable. NBA 2k14 for PC is intolerably stupid. First, it takes an hour just to get into the game due to the new player account creation and apparently non-responsive 2K servers. Second, even after creating an account (which, I have to wonder, why that's even necessary?) it will get stuck on the login screen (after waiting 30 minutes, had to Ctrl+Alt+Del to escape and kill the process!!). Third, there is NO UNINSTALLER!!!! When you insert the disc, it immediately starts running the game. There is no uninstaller in the Program Files or in Control Panel. Un-freaking-believable. And here I thought, shoot, why not give the PC version a try instead of the Xbox for a change?

My son has played NBA 2k for the last few years and loves the game on XB360. This time around, I decided to give the PC version a try so he could enjoy his new PC, and to take a break from the XB360. BIG MISTAKE. It was an unpleasant experience from the moment the disc was inserted. Which, by the way, only works once. After you run the installer the first time, it will never, ever, ever come up again. You can only go into Control Panel to the Uninstall list, and Redo the install, there is absolutely no way to get rid of this game off your PC without manually editing the registry and deleting the files physically (which I'm averse to do). This is absolutely unacceptable.

Why did we need to uninstall it? Because it freezes up at the player login screen, no reply, no interrupt, no option to exit. Have these developers ever heard of a user interface? Do they realize that a game shouldn't just go into an endless loop when looking for a server, without allowing the user to cancel? I would venture to guess that the ""physical disc version"" is a mostly broken hack of the Steam version.

I thought this was the Steam version, was expecting a Steam code inside. Apparently there is more than one ""PC version"" of the game, as if that makes any sense. At least the Steam version would be able to uninstall the game easily and re-install it if desired. This physical disc non-Steam game is absolutely broken. Amazon owes me a Steam code and I don't know how I'm going to get rid of this off my son's PC in order to install the Steam version. This sort of experience was supposed to be the heyday of PC gaming, not 2013. I assume the Steam version can be installed/re-installed/uninstalled like any Steam game. The standalone PC version, though, is a total bust.

[EDIT 11/25/13] Amazon gave me a refund with a restocking fee applied and I have to spend about $3.00 to send it back. So I only threw away about $10.00, but it's better than $30. Will apply that toward the XB360 version."
627,1,"I want to preface this review by stating that I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do like to play after work or when I'm bored to let off a little steam.  Unfortunately this game causes my blood pressure to skyrocket.

This game could have been so much fun - it has amazing graphics and sense of motion, but it is absolutely ruined by some of the most frustrating gameplay I have ever experienced.  Be prepared to die over and over and over and over again, even on the easiest setting.  I would suggest renting it, or downloading the demo and spare yourself the agony of playing this."
628,1,I'm ordering this game on super NES on Ebay. It's only $3. I heard it was good so I want it. I'm also buying Ultimate MK3 and MK Annihilation. It's only $5 all together. I'm SO MAD that Baraka isn't in it. At least Kung Lao is in it. I like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee. Nightwolf's friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers. I like Sindel's animality. I am SO buying this game.
629,1,"Don't believe all the hype!  Less than 3 hours into the game and I immediately traded it in, and here's why..

I have no problem with hunting a ton of different animals in order to craft items, but when you hunt a ton of animals, then you die, you lose ALL of your animal skins!  ALL OF THEM!  Now why the f*** would I want to play a game where all of my efforts have been wasted???  You gotta be out of your mind!  After dying on the battlefield, whether it's by a pirate or an animal, you should KEEP all of the hides you've hunted!  Instead, you start right back at your last saved checkpoint.  It's absolutely unbelievable, and I can't believe they didn't put any effort into designing an appropriate save feature.

Luckily, I bought this for around $15.  I also have Far Cry 4 for PS4, which I bought for $15 as well.  It's still sitting on my shelf, unwrapped.  Guess what?  I have no interest in playing that game at all.  It's being traded in as well.  Between the money-grubbing DLC that video games have these days, on top of the design flaws a la Far Cry 3, I'm definitely going to slowly be giving up console gaming really soon."
630,1,Runs slow on a Dual Core with 2 GB of ram and 256 MB of video ram. It takes extremely poor programming to get this kind of a cr*****y game. Many other games run much faster while displaying many more polygons. The game play it's self of course is nothing new. Same old Starcraft knock off. Unit interaction is cumbersome considering most units are not visible if you zoom out enough to see their full firing range. Changing screen resolution does not help. I would go with Warcraft 3 over this anyday. Now If only I could return this piece of  ........
631,1,"I love a lot of Square games and bought this on the strength of the reviews, but I thought this game was terrible. I disliked the music, the style of the art, the premise of the story, the real-time dual-screen combat using the stylus, the idea of buying buttons as item upgrades, and liked nothing about it.

If you're an RPG fan and money means anything to you, do your homework before purchasing this one. I did my homework but should have done more."
632,1,"Granted I'm not all that great at fighting games, but I can usually at least muddle my way through a few levels and squeeze some fun out of a game. This game wasn't what I expected at all. The controls are extremely clunky. You have to be in a particular spot to pick up an object, and it's way too easy to stand on top of it instead. Trying to pull off moves seems random at times, with the game favoring the enemy as far as timing goes.

The story is nearly nonexistent. ""So-and-so is at the bridge, go stop him from damaging it."" Why even bother? And what's the point of unlocking characters if you don't get to choose who you can play as? It takes forever to fight one round, and you have to win 2 out of 3 to win the match.

The only thing I found nice about the game was the graphics. It's a very nice looking game. But it wasn't enough to keep me playing for more than an hour."
633,1,"Here are the facts:

Electronic Arts Says:
""Authorization limits
... you are limited to five authorizations. So what's an authorization? The first time you actually run the game on a machine, we will authorize that machine. If you reach the authorization limit, the game will not run on a new machine. If you make major changes to the computer (switching out multiple pieces of hardware, install a new OS, etc.) you might need to reauthorize the machine.""

What they don't mention here is that a ""major change"" to your computer can be quite a bit less than changing out multiple pieces of hardware. In fact, changing a keyboard, mouse, or joystick or any number of USB devices could be regarded as a ""major change"". Upgrading drivers for you sound or video card might be a major change. The rules are not defined and you will not know for sure what may or may not use up an authorization.

So if you use up all of your Authorizations? Electronic Arts says:
""Just give us a call...
If you had a run of bad luck, some hardware failures, a botched OS install, your notebook was stolen, you spilled a coke on your keyboard - you get the idea - and all five of your authorizations have been used up, just give us a call. We'll work with you and provide as many additional authorizations as are appropriate.""

What they fail to mention here is that calling Electronic Arts for technical support is not free. You will be charged 2.50/minute plus any toll charges.

Now consider the idea that you have bought 5 Electronic Arts games over time and one by one they all run out of authorizations. When the authorizations start running out, do you honestly want to call EA every time you make a hardware change to ask them to allow you to play a game you already paid for? What a hassle!

Please don't buy this game; don't support this kind of DRM scheme. I don't know if this scheme is to prevent used-game resales or if they really believe it makes a dent in piracy. It doesn't matter why, they are going too far and punishing the honest consumer, so it's time to punish their sales."
634,1,"What if the Nazis had won world war two?  For that matter, what if, having conquered all of Europe, Hitler's armies invaded the United States?  Imagine that you're a construction worker on a building when suddenly, missiles slam into the girders around you.  Looking up, you see the impossible...a fleet of Nazi zeppelins descending upon your city, accompanied by a fleet of warships, and backed up with hundreds upon hundreds of jets and fighters sweeping among the skyscrapers, blasting everything in sight.

It's a terrific premise for a video game, but unfortunately, that's all ""Turning Point"" has going for it.

""Turning Point"" is your standard first person shooter.  You run around shooting those dastardly Nazis, gathering and swapping weapons as needed, and interacting with the environment at various moments to activate bridges, man machine gun turrets, and plant bombs.  All pretty standard affairs with nothing too extraordinary, save for being able to occasionally grapple an enemy in hand to hand combat, whereupon you can either take them hostage as a human shield, or kill them easily.  While most of those kills are variations of knocking them out with your fists, bashing them with weapons, etc. a few are occasionally quite humorous, such as chucking a paratrooper off a skyscraper, tossing a thug into a furnace and locking the doors shut (Irony!), or drowning one unfortunate soldier in a toilet bowl.

However, aside from its instant kills and the fantastic premise, ""Turning Point"" doesn't really work, for the simple fact that it feels unfinished.  With such a Hollywood caliber premise, the story in ""Turning Point"" is practically non-existent, outside of a handful of cut scenes.  Characters come and go at random, and are all equally forgettable.  The player character is a construction worker who wears a red shirt and has no personality, motives, or goals, and is frequently sent in by trained marines to do their dirty work.

Gameplay is average, with not much to distinguish it.  Your foes are competent, though not particularly smart.  They'll attack you en mass to try and make up for their average AI, which largely resorts to ducking behind obstacles and chucking LOTS of grenades (one big problem: the grenade indicator does not tell you how close a grenade is to your position, which makes it nearly impossible to figure out if you're going to get hit or not).  If you take too much damage, you have to retreat to heal, which happens very quickly, as you heal in about three seconds, no matter how much damage you take.  However, this won't help you in the last third of the game, which throws hordes of enemies your way who have much better accuracy then their first and second level counterparts.  In one nightmarishly difficult sequence on a bridge, you'll be assaulted by at least ten guys with rockets, rapid fire sniper rifles, combat shotguns, a few blimps, and even a giant zeppelin.  Add in the fact that checkpoints are few and far between, and the last act of the game, or most of the game for that matter, just isn't any fun.

In keeping in line with the thin story, levels are connected by the barest of threads.  At the beginning of the game, your goal is to escape and head to Washington.  After a cut scene, you're suddenly in a safe house and have to defend it, with no explanation of how you got there, or what you were doing there in the first place.  This jumpy feeling pervades every area of the game, and as a result, we have no emotional interest in it.  Even when we're told that the fate of the world is in our hands, we just don't care.  There's so much potential in this world for a great story, and it's left completely untapped.  When the end credits rolls around, we're left wondering why we didn't see more of it.  Is Hitler still alive?  Does Canada and Mexico join forces with the United States?  What about Japan and Russia?  We never find out the answers to these questions, and countless others.

It's a shame really.  While the first level of the game does an outstanding job immersing you in the world, once you exit the skyscraper, it all goes down hill.  ""Turning Point"" is proof that a fantastic idea can only go so far without good execution.  While it has an outstanding premise and a fantastic opening sequence, a non-existent story, poor characters, and unfinished feel make it a dull game that is ultimately not worth your time."
635,1,"UPDATE:
Chances are you aren't going to buy this, since the latest reviews are 3 years old. The Adapter failed inexplicably after some time and refused to work. Be sure to look into the new Wireless N adapter or the don't worry about it at all since the Xbox 360 ""Slim"" models feature built in Wireless N adapters.

----
(original review)

The Wireless Network Adapter was pretty much a breeze to setup. I brought my Xbox360 to my friend's and it immmediately ""latched onto"" an available wireless network.

At home I have a WEP encrypted/secure network. Through the console settings, the adapter found my network. I think plugged in my password and it was easy from there. I wasn't sure how games like Gears of War, Rainbow Six: Vegas and Lost Planet (read: fun multiplayer games) would handle. Turns out they work out fine on my 802.11g network.

I'll echo another reviewer's issue: when turning on the Xbox, you have to make sure that the USB plug is firmly seated into the USB port of the console. When bringing the console over to a friend's, I hadn't pushed it all the way in and there was no activity light on the adapter itself (not red, nor green, no light at all). Once I unplugged and plugged it back in, it lit up.

So far so good. Yes, expensive, but it works fine."
636,1,"This Sequel/Movie Tie-in is short and bitter.

The game is not a true sequel as the whole game takes place after War for Cybertron but before Fall of Cyberton. It's a side story really, it starts in the Movie fictional world and it's about certain event that happens in the past and you replay those events that occured in the Games universe.

The Movie universe parts of the game are events that happen just after the movie.

Graphics are probably the worst of the whole series, super pixelated paired with the poorest AI and voice acting possible. Even the PS2 and Original XBOX could have pushed out a similar looking game.

The game and it's story serves no purpose other than to sell something titled Transformers at the same time a slew of Toy and Movie comes out the same time and to gouge every dollar from you.

**** - BEWARE - SPOILERS BELOW - *********

They talk about Multiverses and your not sure if the events of the game really relate to each other in the movie world because everything is super vague in details. The main object in the game you really never see it in it's true glory, it's more of a tease than a plot.

The ending is the worse as it basically says that your time is wasted in the game *****SPOILER***** because The Dark Spark (The Decepticon Matrix) travels the multiverse and when it leaves the movie universe at the very end it goes back the Game universe and then the credits roll. So it may be the next TRUE sequel to Fall of Cybertron.

Your never sure that the two universes are really part of the same continuity or if their separate tales woven together and the ending makes it more confusing to know what you exactly played for."
637,1,"Why did Nintendo waste its time, energy, and precious resources in re-creating an otherwise already stale SNES title? This game is basically the same as a Link between worlds. The resemblence is uncanny. There's a reason why games are supposed to evolve over time, not re-create the same stale levels, dungeons, and ridiculously difficult environments that Ocarina of Time Zelda fans have grown to hate. I would much rather see a sequel for Majora's mask on 3DS... why didn't they do that? This game is a major flop! Spend your money on something fun like Pokemon instead."
638,1,"This Game will not run under Windows 7 in all its current and prior (older) versions. I spent lots of time getting it to work, but no: the game is too old for modern computers."
639,1,"I did not notice any difference on my 52"" LCD from 6' away. It sucked the life out of my batteries, twice. I must have left it on? The warning sound goes off after one or two hours but when you get playing you forget all about it. The blue LED light on the front is SO bright I had to cover part of it up with electrical tape."
640,1,"It's just an Arcade game. Nothing realistic about it. It is so far from real hunting, I just had to get rid of it. I guess it is great for the millions of people who have never done anything real, but just do gaming all the time. Probably it seems cool for them, but for any kind of a real hunter, it is not realistic at all. It's just a shoot 'em up game on a timer, just like any Arcade game.

Bass Pro Shops  ""The Hunt"" is about the only one I have seen that is almost realistic, since the old Deer Hunter 2004 game, for the PC."
641,1,Was misinformed by the title this wasent compatible but they were generous with refund and letting me keep products
642,1,"To play this game -- even to play it alone, without connecting to anybody -- you are required to give the company your real name, email address, home address, birthdate, and phone number.  This is required information, not optional."
643,1,"DO NOT BUY THESE !!!!  The first day they stopped working, not just one but both of them.. What a waste of money...."
644,1,"This game was on sale ($9.99) and looked very interesting.  My sons love all things Egyptian especially mummies, scorpions and anything else with a high creep factor. After looking it over, I thought this game would be a steal.

After playing the game a couple of times, it was easy to figure out why it was so cheap.  The controls are horrible!  It was frustrating for all of us to maneuver Anubis around. As for the actual game - it got tired quick.

Save your money and pass on this game.  The concept is cool but the game is not.  Although, my youngest did laugh himself silly as we made Anubis unintentionally fly around.  It was not as much fun for the rest of us."
645,1,Not the item pictured. Cheap knock offs
646,1,"EA has ruined this franchise the same as Activision did with COD. If you buy a game you should be able to play it 24/7 365 WITHOUT Internet. Essentially they are permanently renting you the game but letting you keep a plastic disc so you feel better about it. Some of us don't care about multi-player. For those of you born after 2000, games used to be just fine without an online experience. It's fine if you wanna play online but it shouldn't be required once the money has changed hands."
647,1,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The AI is useless, the graphics are muddy, the controls are buggy and awkward, the gameplay is repeditive and uninteresting, the list goes on and on and on. More than half the game is impossible to play without 7 other friemds because the AI on your side won't work with you to acomplish missions and the AI on the other team is extremely agressive and imbalanced. When you have to put a whole clip in a character to kill them and it only takes one hit for you to die it makes acomplishing your missions against infinitly respawning NPCs 8 on 1virtually impossible. Especially when acomplishing that mission means you cant us a gun like durring ""hacking"" missions. I expect more from Bethesda Softworks. I just wanted to tell whoever will listen; do not buy this game. I will be spending the next two hours giving this game bad reviews on every website I can find. With any luck I will prevent someone from wasting even one cent on this piece of garbage. If I knew I was buying a coaster I would have opted for one withhout a hole in it."
648,1,"I have a new, near top-of-the-line Athlon64-based system with equivalent, advanced graphic card, a gigabyte of RAM etc yet this game was still full of bugs and play was mushy at best. At different times, I would get a sort of flare on the screen that would block out half of the action and effectively render that particular game over or unplayable. As a result, I have only played this game a couple of times, which hurts given the expense. I have tried looking for patches but frankly I resent having to spend so much time trying to effectively repair something that should have worked out of the box. This game looks promising with all of the new equipment but if it's not going to work smoothly, then it might as well be junk. Unfortunately, I don't have a nephew to give it away to."
649,1,"This is not ""YOUR FATHER'S LOGITECH WIRELESS GAMEPAD.""  The old one had the disk that serve as a better driver, and set up.  This one doesn't have one.  Its got the new USB type of Flash Driver.  It does not work with most of the games, at least for me.  It did not work with Titanfall, Nascar 15, and with the NBA2k14 it would initially work, but then the RT and LT commands on the gamepad would not work.  I do not recommend this product to anyone."
650,1,Wouldn't work on Windows 10
651,1,"Pros

ok graphics

Fun combos

creating a character

brand new stages

Cons

Religious in a BAD way. The game make more ""GOD"" characters making heavy use of the word in the game over and over. Not cool at all if you actually believe in God.

No difficulty setting option. Most battles are 1 vs 2 leading up to 1 vs 10+ with no health regeneration.  Its a handicap gauntlet and the a.i is very hard. I lost track of the amount of deaths.

Rpg not a fighting game! This on is big for me, this game was advertising its ""tenkaichi"" inspired combos promising to be a DragonBall masterpiece. .we its no, its a slow rpg level up mentality no a 2015 dbz fighting masterpiece.

Slow level up system

Creation clothing hard to get.

Fan fiction story that feels like a power point as you click thru endless pointless text rambling. It feels like they did whatever they wanted not what fans needed.

No traditional story mode in HD. Zero use of z heros in storytelling, the entire game can be seen in trailers, you fix time by stopping evil thats the big game. ..no really thats it..they just drag that concept out.

no 1 vs 1 menu option. Because this is an rpg you must search for the option under the in game kiosk labled offline battles in a very buried option...rediculous.

Extremely lacking characters,the focus of the game was to cater to the new fans and leave the loyal. There use of dbz kai voices is heavy, even gt kid goku who was never recasted got a new pitchy voice. Gotenks now talks like a hipster and so does recome.

The wost fighting mechanics, you're strike attacks will only land 65% of the time. I found dead because more often than not, my character was punching air.

power point presentation gameplay. .out with the voice overs and in with the endless reading.  This game take a HUGE step back with this, as it feels like a ps one game with enhanced graphics in a bad way.

overall I can do this all day, it is for the new crowd of fans not the real fans. It just caters to people born after the show went off air..its harder than any game has a right to be. .and isn't going to be much fun...just buy a ps2 and play the tenkaichi series..raging blast one if you want HD..the is the truth. Goodluck!"
652,1,"Beware: This program, like many other recent games, will ONLY run properly on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000. That means that in most common home settings, school settings, or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game. If you have configured your home PC, for example, so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them ""limited"" accounts (a recommended ""best practice"" you should certainly be following), your kids will not be able to play this game. Similarly, if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way, with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to ""user-level"" access, then only the administrators will be able to play the game.
Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Rise of Nations is an excellent game, my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box (it is not) and thus I cannot give this product more than a single star, because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work, and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation.
More information on this issue is available. ..."
653,1,There is nothing realistic about this game.  FIFA has degraded into absurdity.  Soccer is not a sport that goes a million miles an hour.  This game has the feel that they tried to market it to people with ADD who have no patience.  The speed is awful...there is no flow to the game.  It's like watching the ball bounce around while everybody is on crystal meth.  Even controlling the players is awful and passing is STILL hit or miss.  Since playing online I've only gotten to play against Barcelona using Arsenal.  It is an utter joke watching people abuse the pace feature which EA apparently still refuses to address.  The whole reason they switched to the Frostbite engine is to deflect from how bad the game really is...this is now the main talking point.  Visually it is impressive but until EA gets a clue this game will continue to disappoint true soccer fans and soccer game aficionados.
654,1,"This game is repetitive, frustrating, and very, very, very buggy. Wait for used copies of this to sell for like $5 20 years down the road before you play this garbage."
655,1,"This game from what I have played seems fun, however being able to sit down and play is not a guarantee. I made the mistake of rushing into the purchase of this title not realizing that there was not an ""offline"" single player mode. When I did get to play I got popups saying it couldn't save my game, or I was disconnected from the servers. I have yet to be able to login after attempting to build a city, and actually find the city I was working on. ALL MY CITIES ARE NOT BEING SAVED! I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it's freaking annoying for me."
656,1,I only payed $3 for this game at a used game shop. I was very mad when i got home because it wasn't even worth $3. There is nothing good about the game. The graphics such even for the sega genesis. The sound is the worst. The controls are sloppy. The gameplay sucks so bad you wouldnt believe it. Dont but this game even if you're a batman fan. Stay away from this game.
657,1,Viewing angles aren't great should be more like GTA wheb you drive so you can see farther down the road.
658,1,It took so long to download that I went over my minutes and had no internet for the rest of the month. No prob. I changed my plan and got rid of my air card. Thanks ATT for annoying me into saving money.
659,1,Buy this only if you're crazy for FPS gameplay and can't live without it for PSP. Awkward controls (no matter how they're configured) and difficult but incredibly repetative game play make this a loser. Wait for Doom or another well-done game.
660,1,"I really wanted Astro A30's. I thought they would be high quality. But without the Mix Amp that costs an additional 100$, the A30's sound like crap. And I'm just assuming they sound better with the Mix Amp because I don't see how else they'd be able to sell these. They have NO base, and the mids and highs are severely lacking also. I'm not an audiophile either, not even remotely close. I don't listen to FLAK files, I listen to MP3's.

There is just such a HUGE difference between the sound of the Astro A40's and the sound of the Astro A30's that once you hear the A40's, you'll think somethings wrong with your A30's. You'll think they are busted or something. Because once I got my A40's I thought my A30's were broken. But as it turns out, my brother A30's sounded the exact same way. So I'm actually a fan of Astro's. I love me some Astro's. I love the A50's, I love the A40's. But the A30's are complete junk.

I mean honestly, they really sound bad. Don't get these. You may not notice they sound like crap, UNTIL you get a good sounding headset to compare it with. At which point you'll think your A30's are broken.

If you don't know what a good headset sounds like you MAY like these, SO GO FOR IT."
661,1,"This is an absolutely horrible game.  The first thing you notice, though fairly trivial, is that the graphics are bad.  There's no changing the resolution or the color depth, so it runs at what appears to be 640x480 or something with a very low color depth.  Everything's grainy with banding due to lack of color.
The next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible.  You move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape.  But, to turn, you either have to use the cursor keys (which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan, so it's hard to hold an image in your head of where you are), or you click and PUSH the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction (and the pan is so fast you can't see the scenery go by).  There's no cursor change in those cases.  Then, if you can look up or down, the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory.  Plus, the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where it's really pointing.  In some cases, clicking forward will turn you 45 degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you.  In other cases, you think it's pointing somewhere you've been, but it's not (so you miss a path).  You end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out what's going on.  Also irritating is that once you click to go forward, it will stop at multiple, non-significant spots (even on straight, non-divertable paths).  So, you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering what's so important that the game stopped you here.
But, the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves.  The charitable description would be that they're impossibly hard.  A more accurate description is that there's neither rhyme nor reason to them.  In some cases, there's no indication that a device IS a puzzle and not just a static display.  If you don't have a necessary inventory item, you can't do anything and there's no indication that you could EVER do anything in it.  If you have some random inventory item that it expects, it just changes the cursor in the right place (if you happen to cross the spot) and you drop it on.  In others, the puzzle is so vague that you're not even sure what you're supposed to be doing with it or why.  Then you have to work your way through multiple, non-easily-written notation systems or phonetics.  In my case, I uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard, non-phonetically-writeable, background-noise-filled, alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large room.
Impossible.  Not fun in the least.  Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this game."
662,1,Sold it
663,1,"I had the opportunity of playing this game on Xbox 360 several months ago, and dedicated my time on finishing the single player game. Story wise, this game is pretty magnificent, as well as being a game with superb graphics and excellent soundtrack.

I decided to buy the digital Deluxe Edition to be able to play multiplayer as well as relive some of the fantastic moments of the game.

Sadly, this game is broken.

The game runs at unbearable low frames per second, and its almost impossible to make it pass the first menus. I own a pretty solid computer on which I am playing Star Wars: The Old Republic, Skyrim and Modern Warfare 3 on high settings all of them, and I haven't had any problem until now. In fact, I own Assassin's Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed Revelations and these both games are running fine.

I have tried looking for a solution online for several hours now, and I haven't found any indication on how to fix the problem with this game.

On top of that, the game offers me no possibility of playing in multiplayer, as the option is greyed out.

Looking through Steam forums, there seems to be a great number of people having this problem with the game.

I wished I could return this game, but I doubt it being a digital version, but I feel I wasted my money on a version of the game with so many bugs. I consider myself as someone who knows about fixing problems with games, but a game that is prerry much unplayable right at the very start, it's simply not worth the time.

If I would rate the 360 version, I would have given it lot more stars, but considering that this version, considering that no matter what I do remains unplayable, I would never recommend to anyone."
664,1,"From controls to boss design, this thing is a good argument vfor video game abortion.

Just so you get the right idea:
1) You cannot play this game with anything but the wiimote + nunchuck.
2) The nunchuck's accelerometer is the single most used control in the game
3) Reread #2. If you honestly don't understand why its so bad that the single most important function of the game - accurate dodging - is using the s***tier accelerometer in your non-dominant hand, you don't know anything about fighting games.
4) Holy crap. This entire game is hack and slash with dodging. If dodging were actually capable of being done accurately. But I digress on the dodging. Your right arm will fall off. There is simply nothing to do, you just walk, avoid stupid obstacles (like blind-corner rolling boulders LOLOL so much fun!) and flail your right arm around like a lunatic.
5) The designers of this game thought a good way to design boss fights was to make bosses have toggle-able invincibility. Let me explain how this works. Whenever you get close enough to attack a boss, they will become invincible and all your attacks will be repelled. I'm not even kidding either. That's actually what you will face if you buy this game and attempt to play it. You will literally be sitting on your couch, trying to clear a boss fight, carefully dodge all the boss' abilities (or at least attempt to, see #2), and then run up to him and start flailing your right arm, only to hear the ""parry"" sound and notice you did absolutely nothing. Soul calibur, a game based on combos and traditional 2d fighting game mechanics, employs bosses that cannot be comboed for more than 2 hits. Seriously astoundingly terrible.

Do not play this game.
Do not buy it."
665,1,"Whatever happened to the Shinobi plotlines in the old Genesis games such as Shadow Dancer, Legend of Shinobi and Shinobi III? What happened to Joe Mushasi and his faithful dog sidekick? What about the evil Union Lizard Corp? None of that is in this. It's just generic hokum and the Ninja dude is the only one to save the day.
The graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage. It was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fifty-millionth time it seriously gets on your nerves.
There's no variance or long-lasting appeal to this. It makes me long for the old-school Shinobi. Side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as Shadow Dancer are still better than this. It's very dull. It looks good but it plays poorly."
666,1,"This gun is so uncomfortable. When I grab it , the handle is huge. I can only press the trigger with the tip of my finger."
667,1,"I could not get this to work with my Xbox. At all. It just went round and round and round. None of the other games experienced an issue, so I don't think it's the kinect setup.
Just bad. I was super excited to play this."
668,1,"Activision REALLY needs to start listening to their fans... This has to be tied with the worst COD titles ever made to date. The single player is okay, at best. The story and plot are predictable, but the action and gameplay make up for it in some regards. There are some very unique moments in the game, such as avoiding the sun on an out of control asteroid, spiraling towards the sun while trying to get to the hangar to find and rescue any survivors; landing on Mars and assaulting the enemy base, etc.

That said, single player is the best that this title has to offer, which is shocking for COD as it's usually the opposite.  Multiplayer is beyond horrific and in my opinion, unplayable and completely disappointing. Jet-packs, wall running and knee slides all serve to ruin the fun and the pace of the game; guns are grossly under powered in many cases;  quick-scoping is a dime a dozen and makes most maps completely unfun to play as you end up dying almost as soon as you spawn; I've been the victim on three separate occasions of spawn campers, which had never happened before in previous COD titles; the maps are more or less the same damned thing that has been done before in the past 10 titles or so, but with different skins; and worse than all, the dynamics of the character creation are all but identical to Black Ops 3..

The only redeeming feature of this title, is the inclusion of the COD:MW Remastered. Raven did a great job on this, with the resolution and tweaks to animation and sounds being superior and adding to the fun; and the game is exactly as I remember playing it 9 years ago today.. Just wish that they would release the Holiday version of Crash already!!

Do yourself a favor and WAIT until this title is released at a lower price.. $79 for this is a waste......."
669,1,The game is full of problems. Takes 5 minutes to load and crashes all the time. The game is less polished than Civ 4 in almost every way. It's a shame a big title like Civ 5 from a great franchise plays like a rush job from a third rate developer. Should have waited for the reviews instead of wasting my money on the first day.
670,1,"I would recommend it for investing for 1 getting a piece of steam/valve physically to hold, 2 its new but as I used it, i encountered problems with the ergonomics or style of the controller, my hands hurt after a rocket league match to put it logically, and the two synaptic feedbacks are too sensitive to touch and sometimes hits buttons, the two buttons in the back are also wonky, hitting them by accident. The controller will not work on consoles especially on the ps4 where steam runs as well. the controller is big and its meant for hands bigger than me, say gabe newells. i believe this controller was made to please gabe newell himself otherwise he wouldnt have invested as much in it without going to VCs or Crowdfunding. Please do not buy this design... yet. like all good things time is needed to improve the design and maybe then valve will do well in the physical accessories department."
671,1,"First of all, it's $50. I want you to say that in your head over and over like I have while looking at this thing. It looks nothing like the picture. The controller in the picture looks very well made. It's flat black and the material looks comparable to the best Sony controllers out there. Not at all representative of what you'll receive and they shouldn't be allowed to use that picture. What you'll get is glossy, cheap plastic that weighs so close to nothing at all that it might confuse you at first. I'd honestly like to see whats inside it because I'd bet it's hilarious. There's no mic plug for a headset. There's no vibration. It's wired. The triggers are very shallow and have to be pressed hard to work. This might be the worst controller I've ever seen. And that's okay BUT $50? It shouldn't be a penny more than $10 and after seeing the thing, you'd most likely want your $10 back. The regular Sony controller is MASSIVELY better than this. I actually thought that I was getting an upgrade from looking at that picture. So far from the truth though"
672,1,"I really want to love this game, but it is a very challenging game - more in a buggy way than a good way. My kids want to play this, but I dread it, because it is non-stop complaints about how hard and confusing the game is. I have to sit over their shoulders taking the controls constantly to figure things out. It usually takes me awhile to figure it out.

My kids play Mario, Kirby, Nintendo World, Pokemon and a ton of other games with no issues. The Lego games are always a big letdown and this one is no different. Hopefully they release an update to make everything more intuitive and less about ""puzzle solving"" for no reason."
673,1,"What to Say. Running from point A to B,mashing buttons,and indulging in repetitive backtracking. This is the game for you.
There is nothing ELSE to do. Just wave your sword and hope the enemy goes down in a pile of heap.
The sword you upgrade is worthless,because the increase in stats does not change or affect the gameplay.
Graphics are ok,in an unclean sort of way. There is no story to keep trudging in a meaningful way.
NOT RECOMMENDED."
674,1,"Really bad multiplayer.  most everyone is sniping and camping.  The middle of the map is like a wasteland because if you rush you will lose.  Its basically 10 campers behind rocks shooting another 10 campers behind other rocks.  You die from the weirdest angles because of squad spawn.  Im not the greatest FPS player, but there are many other FPS games that I wasn't that great at that I loved. The guns are super weak except the sniper of course which creates campers galore.  I'm not  a cod fanboy either, i'm not the biggest fan of the latest COD's either.  This game is overrated and overrun by elitists who love the game, basically both COD and BF, like republicans and democrats, leave much to desire."
675,1,"I would ABSOLUTELY pay $20 for a collection of 30 games, EVEN if 20 of them suck. I'm soooooo sick of games like THIS that really only give you a select few games to begin with and force you to try to beat/win THOSE (usually) lame games in order to unlock another few, and so on. Come on!! People BUY this because it APPEARS to be a ""collection of games"", offering variety, NOT to ""beat it"" and be challenged by ""leveling up"" in attempt to FORCE repeat play. MOST consumers are genuinely angry to discover the ""unlock"" feature, not challenged or excited by it. They lose interest in the game, trade it in and it gets a low rating."
676,1,"Like many others who have already commented, I pre-ordered the game because I am a huge Star Wars fan and have spent many hours playing FPS games like the Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Unreal Tournament franchises. Caveat emptor! While it is nice to see fantastic graphics and some of the Star Wars characters the game itself just fails on many levels.

The promise was for crafted missions that are played solo or cooperatively. Great! My friends and I play co-op all the time. This game has only 5 training missions and a few survival maps that are actually co-op. Crafted missions is a lie. These missions that you play are nothing but Player vs Player.

Lets say you don't care about co-op. The PvP play fails too. The maps are small, unimaginative, and just plain boring. The original Unreal Tournament was released 16 years ago. There is no excuse for creating such crappy maps in 2015.

Regardless of which mode you prefer, the gameplay is weak on all levels. The customization of what your character looks like [in a FPS environment] is substantially larger than your weapons selection. And your armor selection? Non-existent. I may be in the minority but I don't care what my character looks like. This is supposed to be Star Wars Battlefront not Star Wars Fashion Week.

This game has the appearance of putting $55 of the $60 game cost towards Star Wars licensing and the leftover $5 towards the actual game. If you have not purchased the game yet I strongly encourage you to consider something else first."

678,1,this has to be  by far the worst gamecube game ever made
679,1,"MicroSoft is Being Sued for the X360 Scratching Game Disks.  One out of every 3 (33%) XBOX 360's break.  Microsoft will fix it for free ONLY if it is due to the 3 red light failure.  If it scratches your $60 game disks it will cost $20 to replace each.  Go with a Wii or PS3 instead, or just stick to last gen systems till MS comes out with their next gen console."
680,1,"I play a lot of Nancy Drew games. I hated this one. You have to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for everyone and clean their rooms. I don't play this game because I want it to be like my reality, I play this game to escape. I played on Senior Detective. From looking at walkthroughs online, I did not get some of the clues that others did so I was really lost on a key part of the game. Specifically, I never got the code information from the guy on the phone. From posts online it appears that I stumbled upon the first part of the puzzle and completed it without needing the clue and therefore never got the clue. This made the other 4 parts of the puzzle I was supposed to complete near impossible. Then, within the game you had to play a game with one of the characters and win 3 times. This was very difficult on the Senior level because the computer never made an error, but I did all the time! I hated that game and would never play it in real life.

So, long story short, issues with the story, the stupid duck and fox game, and having to be the lodge slave made this game AWFUL!"
681,1,The graphics are horrible!!! The GameCube version was way better!!! Would not recommend this game to anyone!!!
682,1,"wow. i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games( which is clearly evident in games like, starcraft, warcraft, diablo)well i bought this game, and it was stupid. this is what i affectionately call a ""clicker"" game. you know, i left click on you,i hit you, i right clic on you, i do a magic thing. boring. they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing, but the fact that it'll always be the same thing, every time you play it, doesn't really give you much re-play value. also a killer is the mandatory quests,you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot. if you really want a real RPG, buy Baldur's Gate, it's cheaper, and you get to completely make your character, and there's a totally non-linear plot. do waht you want, or don't, but be prepared to suffer the consequences. Baldur's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control, while diablo 2, you are just kinda along for the ride. diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers, who don't really like the whole variable plot thing,the ones that don't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to, the ones who just want to click their way to victory. this game gets one star, which is many , many more than it deserves"
683,1,"We own 2 xbox ones, both with connect.  The non refurbished unit works perfectly all the time.  The refurbished unit does the following:  Requires the power be unplugged and plugged back in about once a week for it to turn on, Reboots randomly, freezes randomly requiring power to be pulled, kinect does not work to be able to say ""xbox on"" because despite being set to stay awake completely powers down after sitting in sleep mode for more than an hour."
684,1,"Worked for less than a week, was very touchy even when it was plugged in. And doesn't charge unless the wii u is on."
685,1,"I have been a fan since i played the original ME1 amd ME2 both on Xbox and PC! And Mass Effect 3 is very disappointing! I purchased the PC digital deluxe edition (80 bucks down the drain)and the only truly decent part of the game is the ashes DLC! I have been only able to import 3 of my Shepard character out of some 9 having completed ME1 and ME2! I find that any choices i had made have little or no effect in ME3! Worse still this game is rather short it is almost as if it is geared more toward co-op than actual single player! Added to that the games has rather annoying bugs such as freezing up movement to weapons not firing and even powers not working! While i expect the bugs to be fixed with patches eventually, i find that the story is the true disappointment!

SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!

I had chosen Anderson  as the council member in nearly all my characters save 1. When ME3 starts udina is the council member and Anderson is an admiral! What a complete waste!

I had chosen to save the rachni queen! In ME3 she is controlled by the reapers and i get the glorious opportunity ti either save her again or kill her! I had chosen to save her again thinking I might get something good or useful! What i get is a foot note about the rachni helping on the crucible! YAY! I am better off saving grunts company!

Another let down is the idiotic dream sequences (lost count of how many there are) where my Shepard gets to move real slow chasing a dead kid that does not show or tell me any important things related to the game! It is utterly pointless!

Another and perhaps the biggest let down is the ME3 choice system my choices where the most logical and reasonable ones i could possible make (not import ME1 or ME2 choices) yet the outcomes are rather different from what you are expecting. For instance the quarians ask for help to free their trapped fleet. I help them to get their fleet free and instead they attack the geth dreadnaught while i am on board it instead of retreating to safety. I later learn despite my choice (in ME2) to have the qurians not attack the geth i learn it was the quarians who started the war with the geth who were acting peaceful! When i try to fix the issue by saving admiral khoris he commits suicide! I got so pissed i just let the geth kill all the quarians which resulted in tali committing suicide. Ultra LAME!

These are but a few of the many problems with this game! But hey at least the co-op is decent right? I should have just stuck with the free demo. ME3 is anything but epic. At best this game rates a 3.5 and that is only for the barely decent third person shooter that this game is! The RPG element of this game is merely an after thought at best.

And while i do find the orgin requirement annoying you can just download a crack to by pass the orgin but you will have to forgo your DLC which is not really worth it as ashes is perhaps the only real fun part of this game."
686,1,
687,1,only get this game if it's free my friend and i both have gamecubes and we couldn't wait for this game. my friend bought it the day it came out (full price it's not worth it) it's is utter crap everything is crap about this game id have a sexchange b4 id buy this game
688,1,"Xbox live is dead. The whole $60 a year service is INFESTED with disciples of Eric fu***ng Cartman, guzzling energy drinks, and using hack-to-win tactics, and I wash my hands of it. Going back to the PC to play with adults."
689,1,"All i wanted to know was if it was as bad as the one for x-box. Well i was very wrong in fact the ps2 versian is ten times worse than the x-box versian. Which makes it in comparison to the 360 versian....ugh don't go there. I really don't want to go into detail let's just say the graphics caused me a mild cause of nausea. And as for the gameplay well let's just say playing with a turd you just let loose in the toilet is more fun than this game, staring into sun is more beneficial to you than playing this game. I could go on but then i would have to keep reliving the short hour I played this turd. And what is the worst part, you guessed it the price. For the mere price of 50$ you can enjoy a game so half assed that you'll have trouble believing Ubisoft made it."
690,1,"System arrived poorly boxed. The top of the box had a lot of air bagging but the bottom and sides had nothing. I know how UPS handles packages and could easily been dropped or throw in shipping. Poor packing on amazon's side.

Package arrived release day at around 5pm est. After opening the packaging, i setup the system and  the system would not boot up. Instead I received a blue pulsing light on the top and nothing else. I then searched the internet to see what was going on. I checked for HDMI issue, but my system was fine in that regards. I also check to make sure HDD was secure and that was fine also. The system just will not boot. I am downloading patch now and will try that. if that fails, I will test the HDD to make sure its functioning. I am also unable to get into safe mode as holding the power button only turns off my system.

I have tried everything from different HDMI cables to different TV's etc. the system was DOA. I have to say i am very angry about all this. I tried calling Sony, but gave up after being on hold for about 2 hours.

If you are thinking of getting a PS4, i would suggest waiting until they get their act together. They have yet to make a real statement nor are they offering good customer service. I hear that most people have to return the unit to Sony and way 4-6 weeks for a new one. Amazon has none either so they only offer a refund (which I may decided to do and get an Xbox one) I would prefer a Sony, but since they are not acting on this and treating it like its no big deal... really gets me mad."
691,1,"I've played video games for over 25 years.  This game was a chore with very little reward.  The graphics were average compared to peer games.  I would not purchase this game again, and I probably won't make any follow up purchases with this game production company. I can sum this game up in one short sentence.  This game was boring, it has a weak plot, and stupid characters.  The list of people who worked on this game which appeared after it was completed, was HUGE.  I can only assume this was to spread the blame for its existence."
692,1,"Update 10/30/17
after a firmware update, it's totally died. Out of warranty too. What a piece of crap, Logitech!

Update 10/11/16: after a tiny water splash on to the keyboard, my keyboard lost 1/3 of the led. It was just a few drops of water, didn't realize this keyboard isn't splash proof. $100+ keyboard and not water splash proof....

Great keyboard, everything is silky smooth, love typing on it so far, ultra fast response, upgraded from G510s. My old G510s lasted me a good year, before the space key gives out two multiple spaces instead of one. Can't believe how good this keyboard is... so far only been typing on it, well update after more test.

So far after 1 hour of testing:

Led on this was super bright. Had to tune it down, never have I had to tune a lighted keyboard's brightness down before.
Only the main keys can change colors, not the top right keys. or I haven't figure out how to change them.
Typing on this is a dream..."
693,1,"this game is bad!
bad history
bad characters
no sense action
no sense in maps
no sense in weapons
no logical objective in all the game
their is no point of making the missions

i only get like 2 or 3 hours of fun
i waste my money don't waste yours"
694,1,"I've had this since launch, bought it from GameStop who I hate but they were near my house so yeah. I paid $400 with 2 free games. The PROBLEM is I didn't keep my receipt... lost it when cleaning out my bedroom and rearranging stuff... and the TV just started going black for no reason, at first I thought it was my Mac mouse cursor hitting my hot corner randomly and going into sleep mode but no, it just does it on it's own for no reason at all and now I'm stuck with it. SURE, while the TV functions it's quite great, movies looks good, 3D is kind of dark but movies like TRON look amazing etc. I also bought the Sony PS3 remote which works decent enough. I'm just stuck with a TV that will probably die soon for NO REASON and I'm not sending it off for warranty repair unless they have a definite fix and can state the problem directly to we the consumers. I like Sony but forget their TV's and this is from a rare double dip pissed of original 60GB PS3 YLOD after 14 months owner, I bought a 40GB and it's still going though.

JUST FORGET BUYING THIS, it's not worth the malfunctioning potential death worry... spend your money on a good Toshiba, or Sharp I've never had a bad tv from those makers and I'm probably going to get another Sharp if I can find they make a decently priced active 3D HDTV.

EDIT April 19th 2012, WELL it's still working... it SEEMS that the random black screen mainly happens when using it as a monitor for my Mac via HDMI, SO perhaps it's a signal aberration which is telling the TV that it's switching off when it reality it's only switching applications on my Mac? could be, I've yet to notice the screen turning black while running anything on my PS3, games, movies etc... so I have no conclusive idea that there is a technical problem with this TV via PS3 usage... which would concern most would be buyers. In theory I think this concept and what this HD3DTV offers is too good to be true."
695,1,"Do not buy this version of the mouse. Everytime you lift it off the mousepad, it all of a sudden stops tracking. In order for it to start tracking again, you need to re-plug the USB. Seems to be a common issue amongst users of this mouse. Would highly recommend sticking with a Deathadder."
696,1,"What a disappointment!!! Far Cry 3 was amazing, what the heck happened?!?!?! I don't know how to explain the pitfalls. First off the story is no where near as good as 3 and it just handles so poorly. I don't know about the PS4 version yet but would like to try it because of how much of a let down this was. :( It is worth a rent to see how you like it, but after playing 3 so much and really loving it, I was expecting so much more from this game!! I hope the PS4 version is better because I was excited to see that the game has a co-op story."
697,1,No game code with product.
698,1,"they keep trying to make sonic an rpg this is not what sonic is about!

this is game is about as fun as watching pait dry.

and a story line like some kind of final fantasy rip off but only corny as hell.. don't bother this game really really really is bad.

if u want a sonic game rent sonic, sonic 2"
699,1,"I already know a lot of people have many bad things to say about this game. It had a lot of potential but EA just didn't want to let the world enjoy it for the great game it could have been. Too many lies, Restrictions, Disabled Features, Small regions/cities. I could go on and on, but yeah. Maybe I'll give this game another try--When the price goes down enough."
700,1,Terrible deal
701,1,why is everything on the ps3 so difficult the ai cheats the games just plain suck  golde throwing gernades you cant even  shoot back ps2 was the best system ever i only play that bye bye ps3 and wii
702,1,"The only thing this game got is a very nice story. If you actually have the patience to go through the pain of having to restart it every 2-3 hours (because it hangs), remove the profile file every 2-3 days (because it gets into certain points on the campaign map where it crashes all the time and can't get past without doing something like this) and even reinstall it every week or so, then you will discover one of the best stories ever told in the Heroes of Might and Magic series. But that's a big IF, so I think all that wasted time could be better spent on games that actually work."
703,1,"After playing Live for the 360, it made me fall asleep, it was boring and while the graphics are excellent, it just has this weird vibe. The shots do not come off right, the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot, a defender can make up serious ground and block it.  Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots. There are also a ton of missed dunks, even Howard missed several. It is hard to pull of three's as well, since their guaranteed bricks.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead. That should be the new name of this series. NBA DEAD 07.

I don't blame Mac for signing an NBA 2K7 game during Live's launch party. He knows what game is better!"
704,1,shorted out after a month
705,1,Add me to the growing list of buyers that have been unable to get this program to properly load and launch. I have gotten loading error messages on both my laptop (Windows 7) and on my old desktop which has been majorly upgraded in terms of hardware but I wanted to stick with XP as the OS on it. So I have had no success with either XP or Win 7. Some have commented about having the same sorts of problems with any Paradox Software they have purchased. But I have had and successfully run Paradox's Hearts of Iron 2/Doomsday/Armageddon on both of these computers for years. So I was really disappointed that EU Rome Gold failed. Didn't think it would. I was wrong. This game looked promising but sadly I have to rate it a 1 since I can't even get it load.
706,1,"Well I was so looking forward to this game. I was let down by the great hype machine. And the big drop in price already should tell you people something. If your getting it for the campaign Dont Buy It..rent it instead..
Single Player Campaign  is really short. (5 Hours)
Controls are sluggish.
Hit detection is off.
Takes alot  of shots sometime in the head to get it to detect it and the enemy finally dies.
You can get hung up on a little rock and the enemy can shoot you behind rock cover as well.
And it is very laughable on how your character throws grenades.

The story itself wasn't flawed. Just the way it was carried out within the game. Framerate slows down to where the screen studders along.

Multiplayer (Updated) Finally 24 hours later was able to play the multiplayer portion.
Multiplayer has potential once the server issues and glitches are fixed. But does it make up for the campaign short falls? Yes It Does.

For a game that has been out 24 hours and with the server problems you still have people maxed out on rank all ready.

Overall this isn't worth the $60 I paid for it. And still isn't worth the $41 they are selling it for now.

Guess I am back off to Battlefield Bad Company 2.

My original rating was one star. but since the multiplayer made up for some of the slack I give it 3 stars now...."
707,1,Will NOT work with Windows 10...Will NOT get a refund
708,1,"This game is TERRIBLE!!! Do not buy it!
Since this review has earned me a LOT of flak, I figured I'd update it and give the rabid fan's that have been bombing me a little more information as to why I gave this atrocious game a 1 star review;

I was very excited about this game, excited to a point where I was rabidly following any update I could find. Like an addict, I had to get my fix. So to say that this game was unfulfilling is a polite understatement. This is a game that was so vastly disappointing to me that it's taken awhile to calm down enough to write about it.

Let's talk about the good things, because it will be brief. Aliens Colonial Marines started off on a good note. Sure, the graphics were disappointing after such a long development cycle, but it's forgivable, at first, because your just so bloody EXCITED to start playing. Again at first, it's good. It's atmospheric, it uses the sounds and lighting in great ways. You feel tense, and it's perfect. It's the kind of Aliens game that you've been waiting for.

Sadly, for single player, that's about where the good things end. Multi-player provides a decent experience, even if the weapons are terrible and the game types are dated. Imagine the multi-player as Left 4 Dead, where all the Zombies have been removed and you're just playing against special infected. It's fun, and it provides its thrills, but eventually you do start to feel drained by it.

As is typical for the more recent additions to the Aliens video games, this is simply another disappointment in a long string of disappointments. The game engine is weak, to a point where it's more common for the game to glitch out and break down than work properly. The weapons are terrible. Whats the point of being able to carry so many if they all suck?

At first the pulse rifle is pretty great, and in single player it is legitimately the go-to weapon. Things like the flame thrower, smart gun and turrets are a blast, but eventually, like everything else, they simply fall way short of the mark.

The AI is a disaster. The aliens in single player are so predictable that you can count on them to ALWAYS make a bee line for you unless your playing in co-op. Your `friendly' marine AI is so bad it almost seems like they take pleasure in watching you get mauled to death and they will literally watch an alien beat you to death without doing a single thing to save you.
Worse, you can actually shoot THROUGH your teammates as if they weren't there, and vice versa, the aliens can leap through the AI characters like they were phantoms. The hit boxes are a wreck, with the only consistent thing being that head shots don't count as head shots. Character animations are choppy, to be nice about it, and how they interact with the game world is so terrible that it's common for you to `trip' on a rough edge in a level and get insta gibbed by fall damage.

As for the story line, it's confusing to me that for the first 10 minutes, they get the recipe right only to have it just crash and burn. It's almost as if they intentionally worked only on the parts they would display for the previews, and just went `Meh, who cares.' I'll give you an example, and I'm sorry for the spoilers, but for the majority of the game, YOU DON'T EVEN FIGHT ALIENS.

For whatever asinine reason, most of this game is spent fighting the private militia of the Weyland-Yutani Corp. I guess having us play a game that's based on the premise of fighting Aliens was just too much for the good people at Gearbox/TimeGate Studios to handle. It's a move that had me shaking my head, because how did this make sense to anyone during development? `Lets make a game about fighting aliens, but you barely ever get to fight aliens.' Sure, sound plan, makes perfect sense.

Aliens Colonial Marines isn't just a disappointing game, because it's not simply bad, for a `game of passion,' that Gearbox was so utterly fanatic about, this is a travesty. It's a crappy game with the Aliens brand name slapped on top, a more blatant cash grab than I care to consider. This is nigh unforgivable. And to add insult to injury, insider leaks are pointing to the fact that Gearbox lied to us about how much control and work they actually put into the game. Important figureheads at Gearbox are on record saying that they were responsible for something like '80%' of the game, when in fact it turns out that they may have designed a level or two in Multi-player. Maybe. Turns out that TimeGate Studios has been in charge of this `hellish development cycle,' for years now, and they are responsible for making the majority of this game. Why lie about it? Well TimeGate has a rather dismal record when it comes to making games. You might remember them for, well, nothing really. They've never been able to produce a quality game, although to be honest, they have a really clever PR department.

At the end of the day, all my ranting boils down to two points; This game is awful, and the only redeeming factor about it is Multi-player, but even that is a tedious, glitchy and rage inducing affair. Do yourself a favor and rent this one if your really curious, I know from checking earlier today that Redbox is already carrying this. Regardless of whatever nostalgic feelings you might have towards this brand, this game utilizes the Aliens name as little more than a hollow gimmick to reel you in and steal your money. Honestly, this game is so bad it's not even worth the bandwidth required to pirate it.

For the folks giving me flak about the original review; Go look it up on Youtube you poor saps.
It is possible to beat this game in 3 hours, at max difficulty settings, if you don't play like a drunken chimpanzee.
If your competent enough to figure out where the dev's might have dropped a spawn point or a trigger, you can literally run through most of this game without having to fire a shot.[...]or youtube 'Aliens Colonial Marines Pacifist Mode' for a really great example of how easy it is.)

Rent this if you can. If you already bought it, my condolences."
709,1,"Nintendo let us down again, scalpers got all the stock"
710,1,"First, the Good:

Good CGI: Or I should say, competent CGI. Nothing on the level of say, Squaresoft, but competent all-around. Nothing surprising there.

Excellent voicework: like prior games, great acting scenes are numerous here, although in many scenes the lines sort of fall flat. Again I must say that I was very disappointed in the story arc, which seemed to pay no attention to the tiny golden details of the first two games. About midway through the game I was left scratching my head at many inconsistencies and plotholes that were a result of obvious laziness on the part of Bioware devs.

Music is...competent. Nothing grand like Skyrim. It is sort of...""boopy"". If you're expecting something ""spacey"" like Michael Stearns or Steve Roach, forget it. Even Star Control II (3do) had better music.

The Bad:

The homo-sexual angle isn't just subtle like the former games I had played, but rather right in-your-face and had a dare-you-to-say-anything-about-it mentality about them. Is this a video game for kids, or adults? Is it a space opera or a game about gay politics? It was very distracting and had absolutely NO place in the Mass Effect universe. Totally depraved and irresponsible of Ray (CEO) to shove this into the game. I guess we now know what side of the aisle he is on.

Familiarity breeds...very familiar territory as you cut down swarms of stormtrooper-like cerebus troops, geth and cerebus engineers. However, this really started grinding on my nerves after playing for ten hours and seeing the same enemies time after time, much like Gears of War. What the combat lacks is variety of enemies, and some DEPTH to the environments, the kind Fallout 2 had. In short, it lacks a soul. I started to realize that it wasn't an RPG I was playing, but a FPS in the vein of Call of Duty or Gears of War, yet Bioware bills this as an RPG! That is a blatant lie. While I enjoy Gears of War...I know what to expect. The Gears of War devs don't bill their epic SHOOTER as anything other than a fps and not an rpg (and honestly, stealing the cover system from Gears of War was just silly).

Bioware has fallen. This isn't completely the fault of EA. After doing some research on who had played a big part in the creation of the greatest RPG of the 21st century, Baldurs Gate II, I learned that most of the guys that made *that* game have long since left Bioware for greener pastures. Still, Bioware had a duty to re-fill those positions with the brightest minds in the industry, and instead chose people who were experts not at creating absorbing rpg games, but rather those that are experts at creating mindless propaganda pieces, filled with cookie-cutter levels/enemies and ignoring the fans. It is as if NO ONE who worked on Mass Effect 1 had any input on this game. Perhaps the brass tossed the new designers a mass effect 1 disc and said ""here, have a look at this if you have time""?

Origin. Nothing more I can say that hasn't already been stated.

Minor Spoiler Alert:
And what exactly was the deal with stealing a picture off of the net (Tali)? Surely with a multi-million dollar budget, the developers could have done a better job at this?

I will never buy another Bioware game again. Ever.

Perhaps the two CEOs of Bioware should go back into medicine. They have clearly let the money and fame go to their head."
711,1,The graphics are simple looking. You are in the middle of the screen and little enemies are coming at you from all angles like the old arcade game asteroids. Its real lame-dont get it.
712,1,"Game play here is great, Many of the other reviews give examples and I agree with them that it is a lot of fun. I also agree with the reviewers who said this is 9/10 game...that is, I agreed with them right up to the point that I experienced a game breaking glitch where you can't save your progress anymore. Checking the developers web site they say basically that they take the issue very seriously and they'll fix it....more than 2 MONTHS AGO and it is still not fixed. What you are left with is a game where you're going to lose progress and that is totally unfit for sale. I'm tired of developers who don't properly test games and foist defective products off on the public. Just google the issue and read the complaints."
713,1,"Do not buy this for PC multiplayer now. It's too late. The fun has gone out of it. The PC multiplayer is now saturated with players that cheat (and easily get away with it). The cheaters are also those who spout profanity, sexism, racism, and bullying. It's a cesspool. Cheaters always know where you are on the map and they hardly ever miss (hitting regular players that is). They can turn their unauthorized advanced abilities on and off at will. So they start playing without them and as soon as they are not doing so well they turn them on until they are comfortable with their lead and then turn them off. OK, here's my fantasy. Someone invents a program that tracks, verifies and identifies the cheaters and either shuts the hacks down or sends a super virus down their pipe that wipes their hard drives. They SO deserve it. That's the second best idea I have but I do not have this ability. The best idea I have is to stop playing. That I can do and as of this moment, I have done."
714,1,I thought these would be like a hadder rubber grips and thought it would be small grips. The grips are big and they are real soft (silicone). I don't like the way they feel on the ps4 controller. Feels like they would come off during intense gameplay. But if your looking for a bigger and softer feel on the analog stick these would be good.

I made the foolish mistake of doing this, I downloaded the files from the Amazon Games and Software Downloader, I attempt to install the game and to my suprise the files that were downloaded were all currupted (I am smacking myself at this point for even going on the foolish adventure)so I run my compatability program and since I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit and once again...the files are still currupted (Now I am starting to smoke). So I do what every Teir 1, 2, and 3 technical support person would tell you since I have a degree in both software development, and computer networking, and as I suspected my PC has all the current drivers for all its hardware, and software, even ran some checks in Command Prompt, and went into msconfig and hid all Microsoft services. Tried to install it again...still corrupted (Now I am chain smoking and smacking myself for purchacing the download version of this game). Needless to say the game..I couldn't tell you if it was good or bad, never got that far, however I do feel like I was assassinated out of $5.69 bucks that I could have used on smokes. My advice, purchace a hard copy of the game, and if your gonna download a PC game use Steam or EA Download Manager. Because 1: Even at such a low cost I doubt Amazon would remburse me for it, and 2: They will most likely find some way of making it my fault that the files I downloaded from their site where currupted."
725,1,"I thought it would be a fun game,but it wasn't. I'm mad because I wasted my money and time on these game."
726,1,"If this was the game of the year I'd hate to see the other games!

- The 'roleplay' is almost non-existent.
- Controls are clumsy and awkward - trying to do much with too little;
- Combat consists of essentially blasting away at enemies hoping they die first;
- Very poor LOS checking; you can frequently see the enemy but can't hit them and vice-versa.
- Since the areas where combat occurs are so confined there's simply no tactics involved*.
- Storyline is beyond predictable and the dialog could have been written by a fifth grader.

I suggest you skip this one and play Halo, or Donkey Kong, instead.

* choosing whether to use a pistol or a shotgun is NOT tactics."
727,1,"I was very disappointed to get this game home.  I was late to the Guitar Hero ""party"".  I've never been musically inclined (of course, I love listening to music), and never had much desire to try it out.  My younger brother had GH1, II, and 80s.  He was finally able to convince me to give it a whirl and I was hooked.  Living in different states and having traded in my PS2 for my PS3 purchase, I was eagerly awaiting this game's release.  I bought it the first day it came out, got it home, and couldn't play.

The guitar, quite simply, would not connect properly.  I got it to sync, but apparently suffered from a weak signal between the guitar and the dongle.  I would have to hit a key numerous times before it would register with the game, making it impossible to play.  Let me just say that Activision using infared INSTEAD of the bluetooth abilities of the PS3 was a very bad idea.  I don't know that I've ever been this disappointed with a video game.  Needless to say, I returned the game and will not buy it until a different guitar is released...wired or bluetooth. Activision should be ashamed of the quality they allowed to be released to the public."
728,1,"I ordered this thinking that it would be a great protective case for my 3ds.  I was wrong, because the 2 pieces that go on the 3ds just easily come off whenever you try to open the 3ds or even while just holding it.  The pieces are incredibly flimsy, BUT, they were comfortable.  That is the ONLY redeeming factor for this grip/cover."
729,1,didnt work as well as I expected it to work.. sometimes shows black and white screen
730,1,"Because this game is an annoying bitch?  And Diablo has tits and high heels now; seriously?

Other than that, it's absolutely fantastic!  So many colors!  Really, it's worth it!  I mean, heck, just look at the user reviews here and on Metacritic... oops, I mean, look at the the critic reviews...you can trust them, just like you can trust the mainstream media not to mislead you!

So, if you're going to require an always on internet connection, why not just play something like Guild Wars?  That was a polished game at least.  WTH is this?!"
731,1,"DRM, online activation, crapware installed on your computer. What else is there to say? STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND DO NOT BUY OTHERS LIKE IT FROM 2K!"
732,1,Doesn't work
733,1,"When I am not cleaning floors at my job I am rounding up grocery carts in the parking lot. As I was hustling about yesterday to gather up the carts before the thunderstorm hit, I saw the new guy putting some boxes into his van. People said that he just got out of prison and to stay clear of him, but I was raised better than that. So, I offered to help him load up the boxes.
In the process of me helping him, it started to rain real hard and one of the boxes slipped out of my hand and crashing onto the ground. About fifty 'Tekken Tag Tournament 2' games scattered all over the wet ground. He told me that they were gifts for his family, but I could have one if I hurried to get them loaded so he could leave to get to his uncle's pawn shop before it closed.
I thought that was really nice of him and I was grateful that I didn't scorn him like everyone else.
My mother raised in a strict and righteous Christian household so I am not one to condone violence.
When I was in the youth seminary and choir, my advisor would let me come over to his apartment to play fighting games as long as I didn't tell my mom. She would of been furious if she knew about the games we would play.
The magic and fun in the games of a few years ago just cannot be found in today's fighting games. In his unusually warm apartment, my advisor often strip down into minimal fighting clothing like the games. He would spend hours alone with me demonstrating various holding and wrestling moves.  We would get so swearty. Sadly, those days with my attentive advisor and I are now gone.
Classic characters like Sagat, Chun-Li or Scorpion are not in this game. Seems to me that the developers are deliberately trying to alienate their audience.
This is not a game that  I would recommend due to its limited and downright dull roster. Unfortunately, the new guy from work never came back or I would of politely returned the game."
734,1,"i mean, the concept is great and all, with you controlling 3 blue dots to activate some telekinectic power.

you can imagine yourself to be jean grey for like 3 minutes (im an expert marvel comic fan, read my reviews on x-men blurays) but it gets old really quickly.

plus, how do you do a barrel roll with aiden?

edit: just finished the game. Aiden is just a ghost twin of Jodie, attached by the umbilical cord to Joie. how gruesome is that! the blue cord thing you see is a rotted umbilical cord! really, this isn't recommended in my view."
735,1,this game wouldn't install
736,1,"Ah, Christ.  I wish ""Alice in Wonderland"" had never entered public domain.  I'm so stick of these bloody, steampunk versions.  You've seen one, you've seen them all.

And this one is no different: the same predictable look that you've seen done a hundred times so far.

. . . which leaves the gameplay, which isn't compelling.

Here's a example of what I mean:  I played about halfway through this game and then had to leave on vacation.  In other words, I was interrupted mid-way.

When I came back, I was surprised to find it in my PS console.  I had totally forgotten I had been playing it.

That shouldn't happen with a video game.  A good game should compel you -- even haunt you -- while you're on vacation.

This one is really just a bunch of annoying timed and jumping puzzles.  It's like the creators had no other ideas than to do what we've all seen a jillion times before and we're all sick of.

Worse, the game makes you pay for all these weapons and then has it so they don't affect most monsters.

The creator of this game, American McGee, is a drooling idiot who needs to be restrained . . . and then flogged."
737,1,no like my orden is from ps4 your pakeng is for Xbox 360 so no good itin
738,1,"I tried very hard to play the game but the settings just had my mouse all over creation with simple micro-movements and I wasn't been able to alter it.  It was just way too spastic.  Loaded it, tried it and unloaded it within an hour.  Off to GOODWILL with this game."
739,1,"Rarely am I compelled to stop what I am doing and write a review about a product. However, this product is such garbage, that I felt that need. In fact, it should receive no stars.

First, the game can only be used with certain video cards, which is something I did not learn until after I received the product. Specifically, it can only be used with a GeForce 1/2/3/4/FX or an ATI 7500-9000 series graphics processor. Now keep in nind, I meet those specs anway.

Second, you need the 1st CD (of 3) to play the game. Although not normally a problem, if you have an ultraportable or tablet PC, forget about this product.

Third, the installation is over 540mb minimum install. Thats if you do not install anything but just the pure game files.

After installing, I rebooted my Dell 8300 (2gb Ram P4 3.0, 400gb hard drive, ATI Graphics card with 256mb RAM on board). I started the program, and it locked up my computer. Tried again, no luck. Rebooted and tried opening the program, it finally opened. However, all the graphics were off.

Long story short, this game should be taken off the market and the development team put out on the street.

ALL I WANT TO DO IS PLAY CHESS!!!!!! DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION!"
740,1,was advertized as a PS3 controller. Make sure to be careful.
741,1,"I don't find this game to be very fun. To be honest it seems boring. That is one. I played through almost 4 seasons. Besides it constantly crashes. First it crashed once-twice in a while. I finished a few seasons. Now two. It crashes either after entering the season and choosing the car, or on the race. It constantly restarts my computer. Now that I can not even continue to play it anymore, I delete it."
742,1,"Called after order to tell me no case or manual included. Recognized sellers voice, because his third time doing it. All times item is on Amazon for one penny more with 2 photos. Strange as heck. Even stranger, seller called while I was watching Ironfist on Netflix and Ironfist is in the game. Humm! Amazon got a double purchase due this before. Not this time.
... .  and I was thinking about getting Amazon Prime. Hummm  Too coincidental IMO."
743,1,A huge disappointment. The case smells and feels awful. Can't recommend it at all.
744,1,Plugged the car charger into my new Prius... next thing I know my iPhone is overheating and dead... killed my smart phone. Not sure if it's Apple and their bulls*** proprietary chargers or the quality of this product... either way I'm out hundreds of dollars by going this cheap route.
745,1,Tried the game on 2 different DSi systems.  Game kept locking up at same spot where you try and give a item you designed to someone (game character) who requested it so you can earn money.  Game would cause the DSi to lock up to a white screen.  Tried a second DSi to verify it was the game and did it again on a different DSi. Not a good Christmas gift for my daughter as a result.  Could have just been a bad game cart but searching on Google appears others have had the same issue.
746,1,"Spore is a ""game"" that needs a lot more than this collection cute and creepy parts to make it worthwhile.  I was hoping the first expansion or update to spore would provide some more in-depth gameplay. I thought EA should release something to make the game worth its original price.  Instead this ""expansion"" only provides more parts to use. Spore doesn't need more parts, it needs compelling gameplay. Spore itself was a waste of money and so is this overpriced expansion."
747,1,"bought for knight of the old republic, jedi outcast, and empire at war.  I have a fairly new 64 bit machine, win 7 ultimate, 8 gigs of ram, newish nvida card, quad core 2.54 ghz processor, and plenty of hard drive room and the only program that works (of the three i tried) was jedi knight II: Outcast.  Knight of the old republic continuously crashes under different settings and compatibility modes.  I can't even get empire at war to install after dozens of different tries.  I think I will return, I'm very sad, this is why PC gaming is such a pain."
748,1,"Head set is comfortable and durable, but I can't use it due to volume issues. Pretty common complaint is that these are simply too loud with no real solution offered from Corsair. I didn't RMA them immediately and missed my warranty windows so I guess I have a junk pair of headsets. Not the first set of garbage gaming headsets, won't be the last."

754,1,FFirst off fighters are my favs this game is trash epic fail as bad as yu hakusho on ps2 don't be fooled i love bleach but to like this game would just be on the basis that i love bleach luckily i rented 2 for one so ill be not playing this and trying yakuza dead souls
755,1,"This game did not live up to the hype or my expectations. Did not find the game fun to play at all. No sense of directions or clear orders as to where to go, or the objective of the game. My brother loves these types of games so I thought I would get his opinion of it and after an hour of playing he felt the same way and didn't care to play the game any more, even though he had been wanting to play it for some time. Really wish I had not bought this game."
756,1,look at the title i know that ds came out before psp but think about it IT IS GAY MAKING A PDA A GAMING SYSTEM i mean creative idea i have a ds and i hate it i don't knw why i bought it i mean sure in the future better games are gonna come out o yea and for those kids eviews maybe your saying a ds is more durable than psp BECAUSE YOU CANT HANDLE a psp your gonna break it psp is way better nintendo is cool and all but psp just kicked ds's ass in this contest.
757,1,this is badly developed for ps3 and then badly ported to ps4.  the story is pretty bad too.
758,1,a broken mess still in the alpha stage DO NOT PAY TO TEST A BROKEN GAME FOR THEM
759,1,"No spoilers ahead.
When I first started playing my Collectors Edition TPP, I was having lots of fun. Four star worthy at best, because while it was fun, the storytelling was a lot less solid than any previous Metal Gear, and the gameplay was so different that it felt alien to MGS.
About 60 hours in is when I started to really dislike this game. The graphics were all well and good, and while the game was getting pretty redundant for all the features it contained, plot flaws kept popping up like breeding rabbits. The continuity line of Metal Gear Solid started to break.
81 hours in, I finished a special mission with Quiet, and that mission bred more plot flaws. The game became a real grind to achieve the ""True"" ending.
91 hours in, finally achieve the true ending. And let me just say, as a huge fan of this series, with every MG and MGS game owned as well as patches, shirts, and a little Solid Snake Clayboy, it was a real kick in the pants. I am certaintly not the only fan of this series who was hurt by this ending. Kojima retconned the entire series, and the only untainted characters are Solid Snake and Otacon. I felt very downtrodden, and tempted to throw my stupid Collectors Edition cardboard ""leather"" box out into the night.
I feel cheated, and ripped off, and I feel like my favorite game series has just died within me.
Buy this if you're looking for cheap thrills and many hours of gameplay. Don't if you're looking to have your thirst for Metal Gear Solid quenched."
760,1,"the AUX port dose not work at all. The audio is switched, so Left and Right are wrong. I've been testing this for a couple of months. not worth the price if it cant function correctly."
761,1,"Trust the reviews. If you buy this the game is incomplete. They released an incomplete game. Period. End of story. Remember that ""awesome"" game SF X Tekken? Yea? This is worse.
No arcade mode, no trials, online doesn't work, no challenged mode, no multiplayer lobbies, no spectating, no CPU vs CPU, no 1p vs CPU, no gallery, the list goes on and on."
762,1,Ugly as sin - cheap plastic.
763,1,"this is obviously fake. For one thing, it says ""GamGameGame"" not ""GameboyAdvance"". It's also missing the nintendo logo. Please save yourself from buying this. I will say though, whoever is selling this got the fonts right, something apparently very hard to do"
764,1,call of money recycled warfare e multiplayer experience is so terrible if you want to play a game that is hacked base and if you like to rage be my guest buy this game I'm just giving you a heads up how badly this game is I highly recommend not to buy this game the company just don't deliver
765,1,"The graphics are good, the levels are 99% bottomless pits with rotating blocks or flying turtles to jump on which gets tired very quickly.  The save feature sucks and sometimes you will beat endless pit levels get tons of stars for star world only to find that it didn't save and you have to start over.  It only saves if you beat an entire world or you manually do it which is total bs.  The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen in any game ever.  It's a total mess, virtually unplayable with more than two players and even then it's super frustrating because players can cut each others jumps short when jumping at the same time, jump on other players heads driving them into pits, pushing each other off ledges, hit each other with items, kill the other players if you run ahead of them even slightly, die if the other players run ahead or are too far behind you, glitch kill the other players if anyone dies as it freezes all other players for a second if one dies.  If you freeze glitch near an enemy it's game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is ""trip over the other players feet"" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn't match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.  The lack of innovation here also took away from this game as it is a carbon copy of New Super Mario Bros DS.

Update:  They just re-released this game with a new Racoon power up on the Wii U.  The game is titled ""New"" Super Mario Bros U, if they are going to keep doing re-hashes they should just call it ""New"" Super Mario Bros Recycled, it's a far more honest and fitting title if they are charging 60+ dollars for this game everytime they release it over and over again."
766,1,"While making creatures is fun, what you can do with your creature is quite limited. This is nothing more than a small demo of the game. I don't recommend people paying for this and I am kind of upset it is being sold in the first place.

Download and try the free trial version off the official game site. It is stripped down so you have limited body parts and what not, but is essentially the same, and if you only spend 15 minutes messing around and feel like you've had enough you won't have wasted ten bucks."
767,1,"The worst console ever, the virtual boy was better than this crap. Its sad to see nintendo fail this generation. But we all have to grow up sometimes.

Hello PS4 ;D"
768,1,Did not work for me.  It may work for you but the one I got was a dud.  I did not have a good experience.
769,1,Did not work.
770,1,"Its not worth this price.. 98 dollars.. really.. you can by it probably for 5 bucks used at gamestop, i really hate when people try to over price things just because they are old.. THERE ISNT A HUGE MARKET FOR VIDEO GAMES! its called gamestop the sell ps2.. and up games...for wayy cheap."
771,1,"What can I say, but in my opinion these headsets are crap.

I really had high hopes for this wireless device. Most of my pro-gamers I watch stream promote the A40 so I figured I'd give these wireless versions a shot. My first Astro Gaming product. I game on PC, xbox & Playstation so this model seemed like the most versatile version.

1st shipment from amazon came quick and setup was somewhat of a breeze. there is noticeable delay and lag when the receiver turns off to when the headset recognizes it. also when you unplug the charging for the headset there is great delay before the status light recognizes this. that's really no biggie but annoying when dealing with a wireless device with no cues other than that status light.

Either way, 4 days later I have absolutely NO sound when connecting on one of my consoles. I troubleshot for some time. connecting, disconnecting, messing with the volume, with the console settings, with the side earpiece volume setting. NOTHING. Finally after close to an hour i realized that the side earpiece area that allows you to lower the volume of voice or increase the volume of game is not working as expected. setting the earpiece to more game volume was actually MUTING the sound and the reverse was true. that function had reversed

Contacted support and after a few days they admit this is not normal and have no clue how to fix. Returned to Amazon (with no problems of course. Thank you amazon!)

2nd shipment got here yesterday from Amazon and again setup and updated firmware with no problems. When all of a sudden SOUND is lost, this time on my 2nd console. Tried on my other console SAME THING! But this time it has nothing to do with the sir earpiece voice/game volume. Now the red light stays solid on the headset. Even after you've turned off the receiver. I've even disconnected the receiver and held down the power button on the headset for 10, 15 minutes but NOTHING would turn it off. It's behaving like it has a hard error. I had to let the battery die down before charging it up and trying again. Happened AGAIN today. I'm typing this starring at a solid red light on the headset. A NON functional headset that is. I tried connecting it to my PC to see if I could re-firmware it and hard reset it but the PC can't recognize it. As long as a solid red light is on it will do absolutely nothing like it's in a hard error state.

I contact support but just realized now; do I really have to go through this on a $300 product that is NEW??? I don't think so.

After trying 2 copies of this product I believe I'm done with this. In my opinion & short experience the hardware on these headsets are not good at all!!"
772,1,"I'm a very casual gamer, and bought Watch Dogs well after it had come out.  Based on what I read about the gameplay and the concept, I thought I'd love it.  Instead, I hated it so much I barely got through the first two hours of it.  I turned it off, ejected the disc, and traded it in.
The graphics are pretty shoddy in this day and age.  Hacking seems cool at first, but really all it consists of is pressing a button.  You can hack almost anything in the game, which quickly devolves into an odd sort of information overload, with the hackable device indicator popping up with every person walking by.  The driving mechanics are absolutely terrible, and it makes controlling vehicles an annoying chore.  On top of all that, the protagonist just isn't likable and is a very flat character.  I didn't read up on the ending, and I don't know how the story plays out in the game, but you quickly learn that the guy is mad because he hacked someone's bank account and that guy sent some baddies after him in return, killing his niece in the process.  Well, you started it bro."
773,1,"Package states nothing about a constant internet connection. Product is defective not due to the hard work of the developers, but the DRM requirements. Since you cannot return open software packages, I think a lawsuit is in order........again, and this is not an empty threat, I know just who to call."
774,1,"After rating this keyboard  5 stars initially I've amended it to one star star. After 8 weeks of daily use, the keyboard died: no backlights, no typing, nothing. I don't want an explanation as to why. I will buy another keyboard from a comparable competitor. ."
775,1,"Too big, and they fall off!  Removed them after 30 mins of trying them out."
776,1,"I wanted to like Need for Speed: Shift, I really did.  As with other games I've recently purchased, my Thrustmaster Ferrari 5-in-1 was not recognized after the game was loaded on a Lenovo Pentium dual core computer with a 3.something processor.  The test car that was going to measure my skills sat on the side of the track in the grass with a running motor.  I then went back to the Main Menu options, chose edit for each control box, and steered the wheel, pressed the pedals, and pressed the buttons of the Thrustmaster to have the settings necessary to operate my wheel recognized.  Returning to the race screen, I was now looking forward to the test lap.  Well, the car was on the track, but it wouldn't stay there--unsafe at any speed!  I then returned to the Main Menu and chose ""adjust options.""  I saw that the steering sensitivity had been set to 25% and switched that to 100%.  Returning to the game screen, I was now able to stay on the track at about five miles an hour on a zig-zag course.  After again returning to adjust options and trying a couple more steering changes with no apparent result, I packed the Need for Speed: Shift, or an alternative title might be Need for Big Improvement in the Software: Hassle! back in the Amazon box.  How do I know it was the software?  Because, the wheel works great with the other game I bought called GTR Evolution.  My suggestion would be for the Electronic Arts company to get together with the Simbin company.  It gets on the nerves, after awhile, to listen to the extensive narrative regarding the approaching great opportunity.  They even repeat the same exact verbage twice in case the buyer missed it the first time. And, you have to listen to it all each time a change is made in the options. In summary, not a lot of fun playing the game or standing in line at the Post Office to return it!"
777,1,"I did nothing when it tried to intensify or perpetuate interventionism. But its latest ventures are the straw that breaks the camel's back. Before I launch into my rant, permit me the prelude caveat that its loyalists are tools. Like a hammer or an axe, they are not inherently evil or destructive. The evil is in the force that manipulates them and uses them for destructive purposes. That evil is Microsoft, who wants nothing less than to confiscate other people's rightful earnings. Let me quote to you from the words of my attorney: ""Microsoft truly needs to stop living in a fool's paradise."" I like to think I'm a reasonable person, but you just can't reason with hideous psychics. It's been tried. They don't understand, they can't understand, they don't want to understand, and they will die without understanding why all we want is for them not to spam the Internet with unsolicited testy e-mail. Microsoft is obviously trying to win support by encapsulating frustrations and directing them toward unpopular scapegoats, and unless we act now, it'll undeniably succeed. Microsoft is not above the law. And that's all I have to say."
778,1,"Started off good in the beginning story amazing but the gameplay is dull like I said once you get pass the introduction and first few. Missions this game. Turn into literally go here kill this guy all the way through the game and the worst part is
  It's most of the time the same exact guy you killed before so it's extremely repetitive. Now as a fan of mafia 2 I say mafia 3 stepped it up with the story but stepped it down with the gameplay."
779,1,"After a long wait and excitement for this game, I wasn't really pleased, I do have to agree with Rick about this game. I played it through the first story and didn't want to do it again because I was bored. The one thing I didn't like was the fact that you had to use the nunchuck to steer your wagon, can't see why it couldn't automattically go on it's own. I have a version on my cell phone of this game and I enjoy that one way better.
The graphics were ok as I didn't mind them. But I can't see myself pulling this game out and playing again..
Such a shame because I was so excited."
780,1,"very disappointed, I installed it and basically got nowhere with it."
781,1,"I was disappointed with the online always but they do give a very sparse option for offline mode. Graphics are good but no better than Project Cars and definitely inferior to Forza. Absent weather effects.

I was happy to hear they were releasing a patch to play the campaign offline. I down loaded the patch tonight only to fine out that you still have to be online to save. They also said they were allowing livery access in offline mode but you are only allowed to customize one car??

GT go away. You have been replaced by far superior options."

6.  Way to easy to level up

7. Cheaper on last gen

8. Combat works great except that it is boring,

9. The Crusader class is generic of  a Paladin from Maplestory

785,1,"This item has always been a problem. While it is a nice feature that you can charge the remote through the glove, the bigger problem is how small the amount of space you have to charge on is. What I mean by this is there is an outline on the charger where your remote has to be exactly on. if it is NOT on that spot it will not charge and give you an error. So if you don't have great light this is a serious problem. Also many times when you put 2 remotes on the charger it flips out the other side of the charger and causes problems. So you spend more time trying to get them both charging then you do playing the wii.

I am shocked how poorly this product was made. I am a pro gamer and honestly would never suggest this product to anyone. I am already looking for a replacement for this type of product and will tell everyone I know who is buying this type of item to avoid at all cost.

Also the battery life even fully charged on these is not that great. You may get a couple of hours at best even out of a brand new battery."

We are currently contacting Sentey for a warranty replacement - I will update this review to convey how that went.

Shame on Sentey for producing such a flawed product.  And shame on Amazon for allowing Sentey to pull the product, and stop selling it. Amazon should back the buyer and hold Sentey accountable. If Amazon is going to provide this elaborate review system, then it has to work both ways and benefit the buyer too, as well as selling more product.

What an absolute horrific product.... I hope Sentey makes it right for all these ripped off consumers."

791,1,"I bought this on its release date earlier this week-and I've already sold it.  Yes, it gives you a decent number of games on one disc.  But I quickly discovered that's not much of a value if none of the games are very fun.

Many of the games have emulation issues-the most common being flaky control and a distorted aspect ratio (many of the games get stretched to fill more of the PSP's wide screen).  But the real problem is just that these games haven't held up well.  I got some enjoyment out of Rampage 15, 20 years ago, but it's incredibly repetitive by today's standards.  You've seen everything there is to see within the first minute or two.  The same is true of most of these games.  Even Gauntlet seems boring 20 years later-I'd rather play the more recent update to the series-or better still something like Diablo and its clones.

The Mortal Kombat games at least LOOK pretty good, but lack any kind of extras you'd normally associate with a home game.  They don't even include move lists.  (And that's aside from the fact they didn't play as well as the Street Fighter games to begin with, and the passage of time has only made them feel staler.)

If you're a huge fan of these games already, and don't mind some emulation issues, you'll probably enjoy this disc.  For most people though I'd recommend skipping this and picking up a modern game, or waiting for Capcom's Collection for the PSP."
792,1,"Oh how I wish I could rate this game higher. The atmosphere is incredibly good. Unfortunately, that is the only thing good about it. Otherwise, it's a trial and error, save, load, save, load, loop of aggravation. Wrong door, load, try again. Not fast enough, load, try again. Which of the three paths ahead leads to success? Guess until you get it right and then move on. This is my pet peeve with all video games. When they rely on giving you unlimited continues and turn it into a guessing game, that is less about skill and more about luck, it completely drains engagement from the experience, leaving you with no depth, no suspension of disbelief, and certainly no suspense. You go from tension to repetition and repetition kills tension. You get the feeling that you've done this before, because you just have, a dozen times over to finally move on. You're just struggling to give it the one and only solution, in the one and only way that it will accept as correct to get to the next cut scene. There is enough of jumping through hoops in real life without having to turn a video game into work. It takes a lot of hard work to make a game that is open-ended, the more it is, the more it tends toward buggy behavior (I encountered no bugs in the few hours I played the game), but a lot of hard work is supposed to be what we're buying, instead of cut corners. There is a ton of potential here, but it falls hopelessly short.
The healing system is unrealistic, yet had some potential, due to its depth.
You try to take your time and enjoy it and instead of excitement, you end up with grating, mind-numbing, boredom.
Lovecraft's work deserves much better than this weak attempt at entertainment.

796,1,"I got this game for my birthday and took it back.  I play tennis and love playing tennis.  I would play everyday weather permitting.  This game was suppose to be better than the last one because the technology is available to one to use the Wii remote like a tennis racket.  Instead of doing what they should have done for some reason the game developers decided that we tennis players want to go back to playing tennis from our couches, pushing endless buttons to play tennis.  Shame on you.  I thought you had learned better by now.  I am over 50 years old and like to play active games and I know a lot of people my age who paid good money for our Wii so that we could play active games.  What were you thinking.  So here is my suggestion to game developers:  Get out of your chair and play tennis then develop a tennis game for the rest of us."
797,1,"The title of this post should pretty much say it all:  This is a BAD GAME.  Many reviewers are noticing the rampant glitches in this year's version--many more than were in MLB 2K8, which wasn't all that smoothly done in the first place--and what they are reporting is accurate if, perhaps, understated.  In terms of its programming, this game is a disaster.  And the baseball action (fielding mechanics, pitching, etc) make it seem like there probably isn't a single actual baseball fan employed in the 2K studios.  Had a chance to check out The Show 09 on my buddies PS3, far--far--better.

So my solution is simple--don't buy this game.  If you did buy it, return it to the store immediately.  It'll be disappointing not having a new baseball game this year, but maybe if everyone leaves this dog on the shelf either MLB properties will reconsider and send the license back to EA, or 2K will fire their entire design team and start over.  At this point, either solution would likely result in a major improvement.

EDIT

I've talked this over with a number of friends, and we all agree--the enforced yearly output for sports video game franchises is killing the quality of the games.  There is, literally, no time for major innovation, good quality control, etc.  We've all agreed the following solution would work and hope you agree:  Put out a new title once every two or even three years--offering downloadable ($) roster and rating updates for each new season between generations of the game.  Giving these studios more time to focus on quality and innovation would probably lead to increased game sales.  I did not purchase MLB 2K9 this year, choosing to rent it first instead since I was disappointed with the last two or three iterations of the franchise .  And, needless to say, won't be buying it.  I will be doing the same thing with Madden as well.  Use the power of your pocketbook, rent these games for a few days before u purchase them.  It will save u both money and time, and maybe the sports game companies will wake up and smell the new century."
798,1,"UPDATE 08/24/13:
After months of letting this sit, I decided to try again. I downloaded all the drivers and firmware, but nothing. When I plug it in, my computer notifies me that a device has been entered in one of the USB ports, but the Recon3D doesn't light up. I doubt it's the Tactic Link card in it.
I downloaded Creative's updater, and it recognizes the device when it's plugged in, but the update constantly fails. It's a shame because I loved it when it worked. Now it's a paperweight.

Also, I never heard back from Creative after my last email earlier this year.

UPDATE 04/21/13:
DEAD!
My Recon3D is dead. Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.
I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.

UPDATE 12/13/11:
I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.

Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.

It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.

----------

Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it? With their own products?
Unfortunately, that isn't the case.

While I have praised the Recon3D, that's only because I'm using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That's where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don't have the necessary cable to accomplish that.

Therefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don't even get the necessary (""optional,"" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can't even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can't connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone ""optional"" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.

It's a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here's where it stops."

803,1,"This game is completely broken.  The opening moments of this game was impressive versus the first Two Worlds but after you leave the first island, the glitches become way to appararent.  I was stuck underneath the map multiple times.  Glitched behind walls and the framerate was horrible.  It has a horrible menu interface that looks like something from 1998.  Crafting items is a great idea, but when you are using an outdated interface, you really don't want to bother.  There are better games out there that are better like Oblivion, Risen, and Risen 2.  If you get past these gamebreaking glitches, then good for you, cheers.  Wish I could rank this game 0 stars."
804,1,"I had been so hype for this game for so long. The potential, endless with a massive universe of billions of worlds to explore and a game so vast you can't see it all in a lifetime.

Sounds great. And then you start playing it, and it takes only an hour to realize you are playing an incomplete indie game. How did this get so much hype? Where are these accolades coming from?? I'm pretty easy going and like most games and most styles. This game is sort of like Minecraft minus the craft. You collect things until your inventory fills up, which doesn't take long at all. There are numerous glitches and exploits which make collecting credits a taskless breeze, and even the ""police"" sentinels are easy to overtake (by the way, why are there already ""man made"" items and buildings on these planets, and cops, if they're all ""undiscovered""??). The flying is awkward and horrible, in space and in atmosphere (which is no different in the controls either...aerodynamics? inertia? these things don't matter). You can't even land the ship yourself and have to use an awkward autoland system. Gravity? Seems to have an influence on you...and it's the same on every world...but not local animals or even rocks (they just float there minecraft style).

I've got about 10 hours on the game at the time of writing this review, hoping with each minute I find something, anything, or a game dynamic, that redeems this horrible waste. I've been to 3 systems, 10 planets, and 2 space stations. Everyone one, full of identical buildings, same stuff, different colors. A massive station in space with only 2 rooms. The flavor text on every conversation and temple/monolith I visit is a joke, while it isn't intended to be (frozen gas? FROZEN GAS? STATES OF MATTER ANYONE??). This game is clearly a circlejerk for the devs at Hello Games, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at full price. All in all, I am not sure what these people are doing saying this game is amazing? The universe is ""infinite"" but with only 5 or so tasks to perform repetitively and really no immersion at all it feels pathetically small. Games like Grand Theft Auto and Witcher 3 feel so so much larger, richer, and fuller than this game even comes close to.

Extremely dissapointed."
805,1,"This game looked good.  Some of the reviews were great.  I was hyped about the game, the premise, and what it promised to offer.  However, I could NOT get the thing to run!!!

I'm very computer proficient and play a TON of computer games, so troubleshooting is not something that really phases me.  Let me just say that I have NEVER had the experience of 1) not being able to get a game to run or 2) having as many problems with tech support as I did with aspyr.

Here's my experience...

--I've loaded the game on 4 different computers with no success (one of them a brand new Alienware computer).

--I've even tried completely re-installing windows XP, and still the game would not run on a ""clean"" system.

--Initially tech support said they couldn't help me and pawned me off to their licensing company...who said that they don't do tech support and said I needed to talk with Aspyr.

--Aspyr said that I should just patch the product and it would work fine.  When I said I already did that (under multiple tries), they said to try it again.... *Sigh*

--I've read on some boards that XP service pack 2 can mess up the game.  I suggested that to support but they flat out denied it.  I then installed XP (with SP2) onto a formatted computer...and again the game would not run.

All in all, I SERIOUSLY doubt I would try another one of their games.  Even if it worked, their support stinks to high heaven.

Stay away.  Stay faaaaaar away."
806,1,Item was cracked
807,1,"With all the hype I thought this game would be something special, what it turned out to be was a thankfully short, boring stinker. The story was lame and the action tedious and redundant. Also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different, there were images a cloaked baddies, and a totally interactive environment. This game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox action/adventure/horror/mystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shooter.

Graphics -
+ Nice, environments were very detailed
- Environments all looked the same.

Combat
Innovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them. Cool at first, gets old real fast.

Game-play -
This game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat. There are 3 types of enemies, and a couple of unimaginative bosses (a back-hoe for example). The environments while nicely detailed all look the same, with little to no thought in the level design, often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest, a generic building, or a generic office. The is combat fun at first, but once the novelty wears off (about 15-20 minutes) it get's boring. what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take. You'll find yourself just walking along or worse, fighting off a horde of baddies, when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you, basically right on top of you. This happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that you'll be tempted to quit, not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isn't fun enough t keep you caring. I finished the game in a day, yeah it's that short, and that easy (minus the cheap shots.)

Re-Playability -
None, getting through this stinker once is a test of will-power

Verdict -
Possible rental, if it's cheap, or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging. You shouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for this, if you are really, really curious though."
808,1,"By now, I think most of the people reading this review will have already played Rayman 2. That being the case, not much of Rayman 3D will be a surprise, but that's not why you were looking at this game. You wanted to play one of the best platformers ever made, with all the rich level design, great musical score, and of course, the platforming, as well as the action you expect. Of course you expect that, because this is an adaptation of Rayman 2 for the dreamcast, regarded as one of the best ports of this game (of which there are many, but that's for another discussion)!

So, how can you go wrong? You already know this game. You know it's great, and now you'll know what it's like to play it with enhanced graphics, 3D, and portability, without any compromise to quality like in Rayman DS, or with the somewhat lessened quality of the PS1 port which is now available to play on PS3, PS Vita, and PSP. I'm sure most of you currently know how sarcastic I'm being, because this 3DS port is not nearly as flawless as one would think.

The things that ruin this game probably sound nitpicky to an outsider. Even I tried to resolve to deal with the negative because of how much I love Rayman 2. The fact of the matter is, most of them are technical. Rayman 2 is still a great game, and you can experience the PC version for reasonably cheap. But on the 3DS, Rayman 2 looks a little broken. Not much like its normal self, this version of Rayman 2 is full of glitches, framerate issues, even things as small as sound issues. Anyone who has played the original game at length would immediately spot these problems.

Let me describe to you an experience I had just moments ago. I was just playing the second level of the game, The Fairy Glade as it's called. The first thing I notice is that in the starting area, the framerate is all over the place. From silky smooth to what I'd have to guess is 15fps. If you don't know what that means, just trust me, it's not good. After progressing a bit, I come upon a giant machine pumping sludge into a river. I climb up into this machine and walk through it like normal, like in the original game, but something is off. Upon further examination, it turned out that most of the inner walls of this machine were invisible from the inside. If you go to first person view mode from within and look outward, the entire thing disappears and you can see parts of the map you were never supposed to. After marveling at the lack of playtesting, I moved along to another area with a large waterfall, another river, vines along a cliff side, and jumping pirhannas. Remarkably, this area seems relatively okay except for the framerate being kinda slow. As I make it to the other side safely, I peer back over to the vines I had just climbed across and notice that one of the pirhannas is frozen in mid air. Actually, I don't recall there ever being a pirhanna there to begin with. Just a random one, floating, completely still, like someone edited it in and forgot to delete it. At about this point, I turned off the game because I was disgusted.

There are numerous other glitches. In one level, you look upward and see that there are two skies. One of them is not supposed to be there, the other, clipped off at the cliff side for some reason. In another level, you free your friend ""Ssssam"" from a cage, but strangely enough, there are two of them! One of them is a fake, the other one can be used to traverse the level like normal. In some areas, in 3D, you can actually see through walls and such. Then there are less cosmetic issues. In The Iron Hills, you start out in an area that is downpouring so hard that it's effecting all the 2D objects in the area! Your shadow, your hair, lums, smoke, all sorts of things are barely visible because every raindrop that intersects them makes it disappear. If you like hunting for lums in that area, you'll only be slightly worse off finding them with your eyes closed. Speaking of which, this brings me to one glitch I haven't even encountered but everyone has talked about. The 1000th lum glitch! Apparently, there's a secret area in the game where you can find the very last, 1000th lum, but unfortunately, the method you use to get to it in the normal versions of the game is broken in this one. It involves a web hammock that you use as a trampoline, except, it doesn't bounce you at all, it just pretends like it's a platform. This makes getting to the lum almost impossible, unless you do some kind of convoluted technique of getting shot by an enemy or something, which hopefully bounces you high enough to get up to the ledge you need to get to to snag the lum. So, great, you can't even really beat the game by collecting all the lums. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the audio is screwed up too. Unless you turn your music down to about 10%, good luck hearing sound effects even when they're on max. Other issues I've heard of include music switching abruptly, some dialogue not being spoken or spoken strangely or out of sync, etc. I can go on listing off glitches, but I think you get the point.

Basically, Rayman 3D is a bad port of an awesome game, and doesn't deserve this treatment. If you want to play the real Rayman 2, it's available on GOG for less than $10, with some bonus content, and it plays natively in HD (and still looks surprisingly good at 1080p). If you have any computer that's less than 5 years old, I can almost guarantee you it'll run great, and older computers will probably perform just as well too. If you still have a Dreamcast, try and find that version of the game, because people love it and it's got some neat little extras that the PS1, PC, and N64 versions didn't have. This version just isn't worth your money, and no matter how many dimensions they add, it'll still be a terrible port."
809,1,"Please do NOT buy this product
The Play it Loud accesory doesn't increase the volume of your 3DS even though it uses 2 AAA batteries, and because the speakers are located so low the perception of the sound is very bad, the 3DS speakers are far better.
As for the screen protectors the top one is extremely small, it only covers the screen so its impossible to align properly.

I have to update this review. There is a new EULA from the business men/lawyers/accountants at Blizzard every couple of days. There still isn't a game. Please do not spend 60 hard earned dollars on a failed business model.

812,1,"I have a hard time recamending this system. First off I,ve only brought about 5 games for my ps3 2 of witch I never played. between the other 3 Hevenly sword, folklore, and valkyria I dought I have 100 gaming hours on my disc drive. and its already failed. It no longer spins. I have only watched 2 blue rays and 1 dvd (twice). Thats not acceptable. thus the 1 star

  I barrly used it since I,m always on my xbox core system. first gen. release, and yes 30 plus games latter 100+ hours just on soul calibur its still woking fine.

Things i didn't like about my ps3 b4 it broke.

6 axis control

playstaion network and store. (adopted xbox first and even tho free psn cant even be compaierd to the quallity of xbox live) xbox live is definatly the better choice for social gaming.

few exlusive titles of intrest. I brought mine for FF13 and blue-ray and ended up bying FF13 for xbox after sony lost the excusive

The trophies. copies of achivments on xbox aren't as easy to view and didn't catch my intrest.

Things i did like.

The playstaion controller has a better d pad.

The blue ray was able to play a dvd that skipped on all my dvd players the day it came out of box ( the burn looked wavy think it was skipping during burn).

Exlusive games like hevenly sword almost made it worth bying.

The blue-ray ps3 at the time was cheaper then blue-ray players. but alass that is the part that failed in 100 hours.

In all its not a bad system its getting to point were its got the games. but the 40 and 60 gig modles have hardware problems. If you havn't injoyed xbox live you wount know what your missing on psn, but if you get a ps3 get the new slim or 80 gig. they seem to not have the blue-ray lazer and moter fail problems."
813,1,"The game is great. Except that I cannot save my games because everytime I login to Windows Live it says my product key is invalid. Amazon has been little to no help after 15 days of not being able to use my game I purchased from them. They won't even refund it. So basically they told me they don't know what to do. They just ""sell the game"", apparently that gives them no responsibility as a retailer to serve their customers. Let alone a couple day's after I paid $15.00 for the game it goes down to $10.00. Can't even through me the $5.00 difference. This is the first time I had trouble with a product from them. I shop on here a lot but after this I'm not buying from here again and closing my account. What good is it to buy from someone who doesn't back what they sell?"
814,1,"If you are a Call of Duty Player looking for more with a few differences I would try one of the free Battlefield games out there first, or wait for Bad Comapny of BF 3 to go on sale Those Battlefield games are nearly identical to BF4, so playing them will give you an idea if you are going to like BF4.  (EDIT: The wording on this did not make sense I changed it.)

If you did not like Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3 this game is no different. Just a Graphical update and some new maps.

With that said I am running the Game on Ultra, and though in screen shots the difference between BF3 and BF4 looks awesome.. In the actual game I often forget I am playing BF4. The graphics simply do not look any different when in the midst of battle.  Black Ops 2 Still looks MUCH better in most areas of game play. BF3 and BF 4 do look better when you are looking out at a vista. But that is a matter of opinion.

As of this review the game is 100% not noob friendly. Everyone in the game after 10 hours of multi-player is a crack shot and will snipe you from all over the map on all of the maps. In fact I have not played a single game in the past 24 hours where each team was not apparently 80% snipers.

Spawn camping (getting killed the moment the level loads) Is extremely bad in the game. A few maps are worse than others, but for the most part every single map design allows for you to be shpot in the head before you are even done loading into the game.

Also my experiences with Amazon Customer Service and Origin Customer Service have been less than ideal. I have been trying to trurn the game with multiple calls to amazon and Origin and neither will budge. I understand that it is not the norm to allow the return of games, but that needs to change. I will probably be making my next game purchase (CoD:Ghosts?) From Gamestop simply due to their very generous return policy.

Sorry for the Rant sounding review, but I just need to express my extreme disappointment with this title. I see more innovation in the yearly CoD titles than I see in the Battlefield series."
815,1,"How can EA still be doing this to its customers?  How can you release a game and the online portion doesn't work for two weeks after the launch?  How lazy are they at EA that they don't even care about what the gaming community will think.

I would assume that Madden is EA cash cow, so they would take better care of it.  But Madden 12 sucks......bad.......real bad......and it's all EA's fault.

I just bought NHL 12 and it is great.  Not too buggy or glitchy runs fine online. Love it.  So how is it that the one game they should be focusing all their attention on is so horrible.  It is because EA knows we will buy it because it's Madden.  They have been using name recognition to sell this game for years, and haven't made any real progress in making the game better since it was released on the next-gen systems.  My hope is that everyone will stop buying this game every year and they will lose their licensing deal with the NFL.  Then we can have a real football game that doesn't suck so bad.

Death to EA Sports.....well at least the Madden department of EA Sports. You're gonna have to do better than this."
816,1,"These fit okay on the joystick but I'm not very impressed. I also HATE how they rub against the controller. I have no idea how others avoid this issue because i have tried over and over to re-install them with the same issue. I even tried the ""fold them inside out"" technique which gets them on quick and easy but still causes them to rub on the sides. I will leave them on for now but will need to remove for fast paced games. Very disappointed."
817,1,"i feel that dance dance revolution is better and this game only copied it. If you where interested in this game. Get Dance Dance Revolution or one of the sequals such as ddr max.
I also recommend the mats for it.the mats last about a year.
Pros of Dance Dance Revolution:
Good exercise with mats
Helps you make quick desicisions with fast songs
Helps timing
Fun
Cons of Dance Dance Revolution:
very very addictive but who cares
mats only last a year long [yes that addictive]"
818,1,"Shame on Amazon for allowing this vendor, VideoGamesDiva, to sell Wii-Fit for DOUBLE the manufacturer's suggested list price!  No one needs a Wii-Fit that badly!  I hope all the vendors--particularly this one because she has doubled the price on all Wii related items--end up with a load of unsold stock.  I can understand asking for a bit more money when something is in short supply, but it is THESE VENDORS who create the shortage.  Keep waiting---I got mine for MSRP from Amazon with NO shipping charge.  You will too!"
819,1,"This was my first and second mechanical keyboard...with Cherry Red MX keys.
The first one's LEFT ALT key broke within 3 hours.
The second one's LEFT ALT key broke within 30 minutes.
After the second failure I returned them both for a refund.
This was over 6 months ago so it may have been a bad batch...

However, I now have a Filco Majestouch Ninja Tenkeyless...and I must tell you that the build quality on the Filco is significantly better than that of the CM.
Significantly better.
Arguably it is not 80$ better...however at least all of it's keys work. Zing!"
820,1,Game sucks very repetitive boring if you played mario kart 64 then you played them all in my opinion mario kart double dash is the best on game cube buy that instead of this Garbadge
821,1,"My friend loved the game, I hated it.  I mean hated it.  I am a zombie killer.  I love zombie games.  Dead Nation is one of the best zombie killing games produced to date on the PS3.  DR2 was monotonous, boring, controls were awkward.  It simply was not fun for me.  Others may like it.  My friend loves the creativity of combining weapons to kill zombies.  I liked it for about 30 minutes then kept asking myself: ""Is this it?""  I would rent the game before purchase.  Oh, I also got the game fairly cheap ($35 new) and still felt like it was a rip off."
822,1,"What more can I ask for a PC fighting game less than $5.  The concept and mechanics are very basic, which is a good thing. The game worked flawlessly with my XBOX 360 Wireless controller however fails miserably with my MadCatz Street Fighter 4 Arcade Stick SE with Sanwa internals.

This game does require an initial activation using the Amazon Game and Software Downloader otherwise you can play the free trial for 30 days.  Fortunately you can uninstall the Amazon downloader and the game will run with out it.

Now for the fun stuff, i'm running the current AVG protection on my system as soon as I load up Vanguard Princess BOOM! AVG detects a Win32/Heur trojan in the guise of ""Vanguard Princess. RWG"" in the main directory.  OK so let's take care of the threat, OH NO!! now the game post a FATAL ERROR ""Could not MapAndLoad dialog box pops up.  The game is broken...

At least it was on sale for $3.49 on May 16, 2013... I could have used that to buy some food instead... LOL"
823,1,I have a new computer and this game still has given me so many issues I don't even know where to begin.  (Not to mention NO live tech support)  I'll just share the final issue; I finally bought the game because after three days of trying different stuff I couldn't get the 7 day free trial to work.  THEN the game works fine.  NOW it tells me my 7 day trial is over go buy the game.  WTF! I already bought the game!  I don't have much time to play vids and for the money I spend I expect a product that works when I want to use it.  Two Thumbs way down.
824,1,"A dramatic difference between this one and the others in the series. Though just about anything is better than GTA3, I have to say that this was was less interesting than Vice City. In this game there was more customization and bigger cities but that led to bigger glitches and more sluggish gameplay. Aiming system and driving physics were all greatly altered from vice City to this one. And all for the worse. I had some strange glitches in which I would enter a building to either customize hair or change clothes, whatever it was the character would never come out. Some kind of strange glitch which forced me to reload a previous save.
Overall I was highly dissapointed with the game when it was working and when it glitched. I say, if you liked GTA3 then play Vice City but stop there."
825,1,"I am 30yo and love all things nintendo, mario games, zelda etc.  This is hands down the boringest mario game I have ever played.  Maybe it is geared for small children I don't know.  Gave it a couple hours and the overly simplistic RPG system is mind numbing.  Pretty much just wander from room to room getting into simple menu based fights, no challange what so ever.

Never thought I would dislike a Mario game."
826,1,Will not install. Found .exe file to install but will not install on Windows 7 or 10. Tried a couple of suggestions and still will not work. Save your money and frustration. There are other games out there you can play that will not waste your time trying to get them to work.
827,1,"Honestly don't know what to say, I tried my hardest to play the through game but I just couldn't"
828,1,"Inserted the game disc, slow load, then a skull appears, then.......BLACK....

  No matter what I have done to remedy the problem, nothing works......

  Maybe the game should have been named Life In A Cave........wow, I can hear the Bats flying around my head...."
829,1,"Broke after a week. Just stopped moving the pointer across the screen,"
830,1,"Absolute junk, prone to fail easily. I don't know if the newer model is fixed, as Sony refused to swap this one for it, even though it is well under the warranty period. The PS4 is getting sold off. I refuse to buy a 4th controller, after the first three from this series failed."
831,1,"Never have I played an intentionally terrible game since Gearbox's Aliens Colonial Marines. This game could have been awesome but it was left in the hands of complete incompetents. It is poorly designed, has a pathetic excuse for a story, and is incredibly frustrating to play. I stopped every session by rage quitting and cussing about how completely idiotic someone must have had to be to make this game the way they did. Wait until it's discounted to $2.99 because that's all it's worth. I LOVED dead island and riptide but this was an abomination. Shame on the dumb$#|+$ who made this."
832,1,"1. First for all the money you are spending sony couldn't even include a component or hdmi cable.

2. After closely comparing the PS3 to the XBOX 360 on several HD displays I've come to the conlusion that the XBOX 360 produces a much better picture.

3. BlueRay is slow slow slow; not to mention in my opinion the picture quality of HD-DVD is superior.

4. There is no rumble feature in the controller.

5. The PS3 motion senseing stuff really stinks.

6. It doesn't play quite a few of my ps2 games.

7. The unit did freeze up on me a few times.

After playing with this unit a comparing it side by side to the 360, I have come to the conclusion that this unit is simply not worth what sony is asking for it. I have also heard that developers have called the PS3 a disaster as far as its support to produce games for it.

Maybe after sony works out the bugs and soe more titles get released, this might be worth the money, but for now I would advise you to save your money or try a XBOX 360 or a wii.

I was going to send the unit back but a Sony Fanboy that I work with was willing to pay me what I payed for it.

Conlusion: Its simply not worth the money."
833,1,"Yes, it's shovelware, but not worth $19.99 (the price I paid). I bought it for the tiltboard game, and thankfully that game works very well, and is fun.  Maybe, it's worth $9.99, but I wouldn't pay a penny more. The other reviewer pretty much said everything there is to say about the game in the excellent review. I'd like to add that I do like the setting of the game. It's very colorful and dreamy, but the games are pretty much straightforward boring and short. The 3-D atmospheres as the other reviewer mentioned simply just do not work.  Maybe someone can follow up this review in about 6 months and determine if it's worth $9.99. That would be interesting to see.

Pros:
using your avatar
cool setting
balancing board game which requires both arms (there is another version that requires one arm) The balancing board game in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Shape-Fitness-Evolved-2012/dp/B0050SYUAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012</a>&nbsp;is better, although I thought this one would be better because of the 3 buckets on either side of the balancing board. You have very little control of where the shapes land.
tiltboard game (Majesco is onto something with this tiltboard game. This game works very well with the Kinect, and takes a lot of practice to tell your brain your left arm goes up and down, and your right arm goes left and right). I've played it for a couple of hours, and honestly is the best reason to buy this game. A stand alone XBLA title which may be slightly more elaborate would be great IMO.
Star Hop works well, and you'll probably have fun with this for 30 minutes or so until the novelty wears off.

Cons:
short games
annoying music
left and right conrols for Robo Drive
balancing board  game which requires one arm
Sack Hack (also having to use designated limb or head to keep balancing sacks with poor 3-D motion detection)
Crank It Up
Dodge Ball, which is an inferior version of the Kinect Adventures version.

Overall, this has 2 fun motion games, and the rest are boring, but that's just an opinion. If you're really into the tiltboard game as I am, this may be worth a purchase. I really can't recommend it otherwise.

Update: August 3, 2012: I actually threw this game in the garbage. I was so disgusted by even looking at it, thinking what else I could have done with the 20 buckaroos, and the time I wasted on playing this game. The trade-in policy doesn't even have this game in their buyback program. That's pretty much it. :-("
834,1,For these prices I'd rather get the VIVE or Oculus Rift!!
835,1,"Within 2 weeks there was a shorage in the cord, so it works off and on, I blame my kids because they play it while it's charging, (and the one from nintendo did the same, hence the purchase of this one) So I just have to come up with a better solution for my family."
836,1,"I'm not big on writing bad reviews, but I figure people who see this low cost product should know the truth. It did not work for me, I tried everything, googled as much as I could and it just wouldn't work. I even bought a license Microsoft one a day later, and that one worked almost instantaneously. I noticed that there are four options, all of different prices, to choose from, yet the reviews don't change when you select a different option, so I'm not sure if that somehow factors into it, as the working reviews may have bought a pricier option. As for me, I bought the ""Black"" color one, or the one that offers Prime shipping. If you bought one and had a working one, it would be cool to actually know what option you bought, since that might factor into it. Anyway, this one was a dud and I'm returning it. Hopefully you have better luck than I do."
837,1,"Who at Sony thought that it would be a good idea to make a smaller more compact version of the PSP and then said ""wait a minute...lets make it so it won't actually Play PSP games(UMD) or the movies that were marketed on UMD for use with the PSP, instead make it so the only way to play a game is to spend a couple of hours downloading them from PSN and if they already own the game? Who really cares because we will get money from it and no one will be able to buy used games or rent games from a rental store."" Yep thats pretty much the design thought process that Sony had during this project...Oh and FYI you can still download all the same games on your ""old style"" PSP so the only thing better about this system is it's size and it has bluetooth...everything else is either a downgrade or remained the same. So if you decide to buy this, don't. It's a stupid idea."
838,1,"This game lags really bad when singing and that affects your score! I can't hear myself when singing. I turned my tv up as far as it could go and still could hardly hear myself. And there's no way to adjust any microphone or volume settings to hear yourself better and you can't calibrate to help with the lag issues. And to unlock other game modes, you have to sing every song to unlock each mode on each song individually! How stupid is that? Usually when you unlock a mode it's available for every song! Not on here! You unlock each mode one by one for each song! Stupid game that could have been good because the songs on here are awesome! Its the game play and the game itself that sucks. And also the lack of options to customize mic setup makes this a 1 star game at best! 1 star for the cool songs only!"
839,1,"OK what the heck happen here this is not the Sony quality i was expecting but the remote is good but almost useless in a way.

Pros:
1) a decent remote that lets you control other devices (to a certain point i will get to that in the cons)
2) the feel of the remote and the button controls are well made
3) runs Netflix and PS4 Bluray player really good

Ok not the not so good about this remote

cons:
1) yes it lets you control other devices but it a total mess with the button function for example when you use the volume control on a TV it goes into the main menu instead when you press option button it changes the TV channel and I am using it on a Sony TV

2) volume punch through didn't work for me I tried the instruction and it a no go for me I really don't understand it I am using a Sony TV and a Sony remote why aren't they compatible ...

3) using the remote to watch Netflix and Hulu and other online media who ever thought of this while making the PS4 remote must like to torture people  it works fine on Netflix but for Hulu you can't even move the menu screen at all it just stay in one spot but you can exit from Hulu and that's it I also tried it with IGN and YouTube most of the functions don't really work

4) red light on remote is now constantly on after I set it up to work on my TV and Receiver I don't know why I tried taking out the battery's and putting them back in again also tried to check if there was a stuck button but that's not the case it can still be functional I used it on my PS4 and it works its just the red light is really annoying

5) Learning function is a joke i didn't work for me for some reason

well we waited for a long time for a PS4 Remote to come out but now I wish it didn't very disappointed with it.  I would not recommend this to anyone the PS3 Remote was 100 times better I just wished that they had kept the same format."
840,1,"Hello, I'm about to purchase this adapter, but I wonder if it can be used on the nintendo DSi. Thanks,"
841,1,"I love the original Sims.  I am running the whole set on Win7 64 bit Dell duo core w/8G of memory and a NVidia GeForce 9800.  I bought this game for a new experience, but it won't recognize my video card as a DirectX 9 adapter.  And so this game won't even install.  Evidently it has issues with more advanced cards.... So if you've never played the Sims, go for the original Maxis engineered product and not the later imitations."
842,1,"Super buggy! Game has had to ""migrate"" the server far too many times in the first two days of use that I have had to wait for minutes at time in the middle of a race. Once it ""migrated"" I had lost my progress or lost the race I was in the middle of. I have ended up re-doing many things in the game. Outside of this it also has display bugs where things majorly glitch out graphically. My car was floating in limbo until I had to force close it. In addition to this, at least twice after coming back in to play, the game forgot to save my progress and I had to start were it last left off 2 sessions back.  I have a GTX960 8gb ram with a i7 processor running windows 8. Go figure! Since I now can't get a refund I hope it cleans up some time in the future. Not going to buy this for the boys for X-Mas now."
843,1,"I am a huge fan of the Nancy Drew games. This was an exception. For the first time ever, I actually gave up out of sheer boredom before solving this mystery. The colours are garish, the characters are dull, the storyline uninteresting, and tasks and puzzles are mundane. Fortunately Herinteractive didn't let this affect their other games. The only mystery here is why they lowered the bar so much."
844,1,Died after 3 months !
845,1,"After all the years and all the hype I expected that this game would have *something* to recommend it.  Sure, I realized it wasn't going to be the GAME TO END ALL GAMES.  I always make sure to discount 25% for hype.  But,  my gods, what a poor showing this is!
There is next to no innovation.  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake, the puzzles are of  the annoying ""find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack, etc"" style.  The sense of immersion is zero.  The  sounds are poorly choosen.  The enemies are, for the most part, utterly  uninspired.  The load times between segments (which uses the Half-Life  formula) are ridiculously long.  It's also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment.
Well, you get the point.  If this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from $20 on the  discount rack, maybe I wouldn't feel so annoyed.  As it was, I went back  and exchanged it for ""Soldier of Fortune"" which, well also not  ground breaking, is solidly entertaining and, at least, mildly  innovative.
Please, folks, don't get sucked in by the hype.  Save your  money for something better.  In the meanwhile, I'll be hoping that Ion  Storms next big product, Deus Ex, does a better job of living up to its  reputation."
846,1,"I play a lot of games and I have only ever had one or two that lock up and crash my PC. (Windows XP). I run many video intensive games as well, but this one crashes over and over. I took it back off. From the little time I did use it, it was boring and only interesting for about 10 minutes. The graphics and sounds are about 10 years behind the times, (Even for 2006, which is when this game came out).

I downloaded the version 1.8 patch and lost all of the profile files I had and there were no more challenges, just a blank screen and when I clicked on start, I'm in a field with grass and trees instead of a river. I think the patch is on crack!

Not worth the Money!!!!"
847,1,"This game is like, wow... Too many glitches and underdeveloped. If Montreal was trying to appease Arkham fans until Knight came out, I hope no fans of the series were lost."
848,1,"S*** game, No MULTIPLAYER!! Good Graphics,  but that is absolutley it!"
849,1,Do not buy this game does not work with windows vista. Some times window XP games will play on vista but not this game. Live and learn!
850,1,Completely useless. They come off of the joysticks constantly. Extremely disappointed in this horrible design.
851,1,"Ok, I love command and conquer... I've bought every single one back since day one.

But I read the system requirements for this, and EA was negligent.

They should have CLEARLY said in the system requirements:

  Internet connection required for product activation

I'm thinking... This is my last EA purchase"
852,1,"I never could finish a single game because of the lag that builds up as the game progresses.

I had bought every Civ game up to this point and will never buy a Civ game for the computer.  I was using an up to date mac."
853,1,"Stopped working 2 weeks after I got it, lucky me."
854,1,"Since I got my Xbox one on release date I've had to buy 7 replacements of these headsets, they always stop working for no reason. Just a awful product."
855,1,"Already stopped working, JUST outside of the return window! Go figure! Buyer beware, very disappointed with this product after having great experience with nyko products in the past."
856,1,I'm new to Borderlands...never playing the first but with all the hype I thought I would try it. I normally play war shooters like Killzone 3 and Spec Ops. This game pales in comparison. The story is weak. Following around some annoying robot in the snow? But that's not the 2 worst things about the game. The worst is the Spawning and the lack of quick saves. I thought I could overcome that issue. Then I found out I can't even carry enough ammunition to make it through a battle with marauders. After about 5 tries at that I said enough is enough. What fun is a shooter when you constantly run out of bullets and are forced to sit there and just die! Ammunition needs to be readily available at all times. So in summary I played the game for about 3 hours total and traded it right back in after about a week. I would only recommended this game to someone with lots of time to kill. I'm not that guy. Casual gamers should avoid at all costs!
857,1,"Worst Halo ever! No spit screen, horrible story, Master Chief now look like a school boy. All because Microsoft wants money. Everyone has to buy their own Xbox one and a copy of the game to play? And you wanted to say that it was because you didn't want to sacrifice quality? Lol"
858,1,"I bought this game thinking it would be good.  I liked 1 and 2 but after that the game play got very complicated.  This game is so complicated to play.  I'm not one to spend hours on PS3 but you have to for this one just to learn how to shoot and use your suit right.  I got to the point to when I said forget this and I traded it in.  It took 15 minutes to start playing the game.  Really 15 minutes.  I timed it. Other reviews are right there are too many cut scenes and YES the game play is hard to use. I don't want to spend hours learning how to play the game correctly.  Here simple, this button is shoot, this button is change weapons, this button is targeting.  Why be more complicated than that?  1 and 2 controls were the best.  They have lost me here completely."
859,1,"Very unhappy with this purchase.  I liked the first, this one is very different.  All the caves are basically the same model, the whole game is in one town.  All the changes they've made to, oh how do they coin it, ""streamline the experience"" have turned this great franchise into a flat dull throwaway experience that I had to force myself to finish.

At one point I came upon a big boss.  I closed my eyes and wanted to see if I could do it and!!!! YES! I BEAT THE ENTIRE BOSS WITH MY EYES CLOSED BY JUST HITTING x x x x repeatedly.....

This game emanates laziness in it's design.

DO NOT BUY."
860,1,Can't play the game due to always on DRM and infrastructure that can't support the demand.  Their response is to disable features in the game (some of the features are the main reason it was built with always on technology).
861,1,this was a movie not the game
862,1,"You know when I witnessed the local kids playing Resident Evil Code Veronica X you have no idea the level of dread I felt for the future of the series. These were kids who started playing the series once Code Veronica was ported form the DreamCast to the PS2 and instantly shunned the original Resident Evil games on the PlayStation (one of these kids, the leader of the idiot team of course was only one year younger than me).

Unfortunately, my dread became vivid and has stayed vivid onward. Resident Evil is never going to be the unique little adventurous, ultra gory, atmospheric little Alone in the Dark rip-off I remember it as because when a company considers three of the most broken, overly action packed, laughable additions to the series as 'essential,' then something is very wrong. The atmosphere that the Resident Evil that was introduced in 1996 (thirteen years ago) is NEVER coming back and it's all thanks to its so-called sequels that were almost entirely dedicated to nothing but action.

Seriously, look at what they have: Resident Evil Code Veronica X, the port of the all ready overly action packed jerk-fest with a John Woo gunslinging Leonardo Dicaprio dork and a one dimensional antagonist with the addition of a character who magically survived the previous games by a continuity error that was later explained in Umbrella Chronicles in that classic five year old ""because I said so"" excuse solely so said character could be the equivalent of The Terminator meets The Matrix.

Then there's Resident Evil Outbreak, the first online survival horror game ever made and quite  possibly the worst (second only to Outbreak file #2) with more of those random cameo characters the developers loved so much they had to include them in the game by snapping the continuity in pieces. Add to the broken single-player game play with some of the most obnoxious enemy AND friendly AI ever made and some of the most atrocious enemy designs made and you've got pain elemental in one game.

Then you've got EVERYONE's favorite blend of Hollywood action slop and campiness, 4resident evil (hey, that's literally how it's spelled), a game where the only fear you'll get is laughing yourself to death he moment you see the so called 'terrorists' you're fighting. I just need to ask: What are game developer's obsession with playing the role of alpha male in games? Does a game become an instant classic when you have a to baby sit a foxy young woman in loose clothes who can't defend herself, whose first lines are literally ""Don't come?"" I'm serious, that's the first line she has! You know what happened to games where you have to rescue a woman who screams those words at you??

The latter game proves one thing about our generation of horror gaming: If I ever need money and I know how to develop a game, I'll just rip off Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid, throw in some heads popping every time the character so much as breathes on them coupled with rag doll physics, have some pervert in an overcoat sell you nasty things you can fit on to your gun in exchange for illogical fetch-quests and mini-games, throw in maybe one or two monsters and have you defend a hot, foxy woman in an iron lung and call it a horror game. I'd make MILLIONS!!"
863,1,"This game isn't worth the blu-ray disk it's coded on.  Graphics suck, characters suck, story sucks, gameplay is aweful, music sucks, and everything else that makes a game sucked in Heavenly Sword.  Not worth your time, trust me.  If you want to rent this because it's short, rent Wolverine instead."
864,1,"Maybe this is a good game for a child, but it was way too easy for an adult."
865,1,"If the idea of putting you to sleep was the basis of this game, then they have succeeded. This game is extremely boring.  The point and click action in this game becomes tiring. At least later you can flash transport from one area to another. The acting is horrible as well as the music soundtrack.  The storyline moves slowly, and I moved aimlessly around for the longest time before having to resort to obtaining a cheat. The game description sounded like it would be fun, but that has not been the case. This has been move like a travel site with lots of pretty pictures. I would not recommend this game but would like to visit Anacapri."
866,1,"I'm starting this out with a bold statement.  I have been watching reviews and videos on this game since release day.  I've checked back every day.  But despite hundreds of reviews read and dozens of videos watched:  I have not played the game.

So WHY do I feel I can review this?  ANSWER:  The server issues alone are enough to give the game a 1 star at current time.  Some of those issue will improve, some will remain.  The game also happens to have issues outside this.  Issues agreed on by both sides.  I'll tackle those too.

Server issues:
1.  Servers being crap on launch week = Horrible, but forgivable.  Code limitations should have been ironed out in beta, and plenty of hardware should have been provided for launch.  Blizzard is NOT a poor indie company that randomly got massive unforseen demand.  Still, things happen.

2.  Servers being crap on the following week = WTF.  Again Code should have been stress tested and broken during beta.  If they didn't have enough servers a week gave them plenty of time to set up more.  Blizzard has the money, it just didn't want to spend it.

3.  Servers still having regular issues over 2 weeks following launch = No words for this.  Simply unacceptable for a company of its resources and the amount of development time/metrics they had for this.

4.  Cannot play single player offline.

5.  Server problems further destroy the single player experience.

6.  Great, now people are regularly getting hacked playing single player.  Bravo Blizzard.

Non-Server Issues:

7.  Character customization has been disintegrated.  While this offers a more flexible approach that streamlines and yes simplifies, it nonetheless robs a very important part of the game away from many people.  Also, that streamlining and the old issues could have been fixed within the old system easily.  This lowers replay.  Yes maybe YOU don't have an issue with this but people have spoken.  An overwhelming amount of people DO have an issue with this, minor or major.

8.  Items.  Diablo has always had a strong loot basing as well as being fun to play.  Unfortunately the loot distribution and balancing in Diablo 3 is broken atm.  Magic items are better than items of higher rarity because they have an inherently much higher dps.  Items also appear to be more rare in general by far.  This lower also replay.

9.  Auction House, for money.  That's ok, that's what the auction house is for right?  Oh, but ya, you're decent items will likely be selling for real world cash now.  At least, once it actually works reliably and they add real money.  So enjoy your poor itemization unless you want to pay.  Because even if you trade 1:1 value on the AH you'll lose 15%+ listing fee to blizzard.  Both sides will :).  Yay?

10.  Randomization is very limited:  While mobs randomize fairly well maps themselves randomize only minimally.  This leads to the same layout and very similar experience on additional runs through an area.  This is the 3rd thing that lowers replay.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

11.  Linear.  With the game being linear your forced down a cattle chute constantly being hemmed in and guided in only X direction.  This inability to freely roam even further limits replay.  Combined with the simplified character customization, itemization, and randomization this is a killer that has many people already burning out.  People that would not burn out near as easily on this exact same game otherwise.  This is further hurt by many reports that the maps are very similar to D2 maps.

12. Graphics:  When most people including most 5 star reviews note that the graphics are last gen, I believe them.  This isn't as important to me but if graphics being lower than they should be for a game of this calibur bothers you than it's a big strike.

13.  Story:  I'm sorry again, most people even 5 star reviews saying the story is forgettable (if they are kind) and horrible (if they are mean) tells me that the story is simply lack luster.  I don't expect epicness in this day and age, but cheese factor and mismanagement of prominent characters is a no no.  Only certain genres like comic books and comedies can pull that off IF DONE RIGHT.

Overview:

Lets disregard the server issues as that would automatically fail this game as a consideration for purchase.  It's assumed these will, eventually (and apparently with the minimum money investment possible) be fixed.  Regardless it's UNFORGIVABLE for a company with the resources of Blizzard and with the testing time/metrics/sales predicitions they had at their disposal.

Is this a fun game from everything I know?  Yes.  Will it be worth playing after they get server issues lined out?  Yes.  Is it a AAA title or worth $60?  HECK NO!!  This is the level of polish, length, and quality that you should expect from an Indie developer just putting itself on the map and selling the game at $15-$20.  This is not the level of game expected of a company the size and notoriety of Blizzard.

You'd be way way better off spending your $60 on say, Fallout 1, 2, 3 and New Vegas.  Torchlight + Titan's Quest, and $20 left over for whatever you wish.  ETC.  There are way too many options to justify $60 on this game when you can make far far better use of your money elsewhere with far less frustration and likely more and longer fun."

<Original review>
I wasn't onboard the No Man's Sky hype train prior to release.  I preordered a few days before release date, practically on a whim, just so I could get it quickly and try it out.

Initially, I was very pleased with the game:  it felt like early-days Minecraft survival mode on a galactic scale, and I felt almost like I was returning home.  If I would have reviewed it during that honeymoon phase, I would have given it 4, perhaps 5 stars, with caveats.

Earlier this evening, after having put several hours of gameplay into the game every day since release, I was determined instead to leave a 3-star review, based on the fact that the game is so very buggy.  I've had far too many crashes to count.  I once had a crash loop that ended with me crashing 6 times before I could make any progress in the game, and one of those crashes was on the title screen.  Actually, I've now had two separate crashes while on the game's title screen--I wish I had something witty to say about that, but I don't, so I'll just repeat it:  this game has already crashed twice on the very first screen it opens to, mere seconds after launching.

But everything has changed yet again, and not for the better, hence my current one-star rating.  This game's save feature is very poor:  you can manually save only at certain types of beacons on planets, and otherwise you auto-save when exiting your ship.  This may sound like a good system on the surface, but it's fatally flawed.  You cannot have multiple save files, so if your one save file ever becomes corrupt, or is saved during a certain-death scenario, then it is really and truly game-over.  This is exactly what happened to me.  I landed on a planet, and somehow (unknown to me at the time) my ship landed just inside a mountain (outside of the playable map).  When I exited my ship, my one and only save file was automatically overwritten with my character falling inexorably to their death below the surface of the planet.  Even using my jetpack, I cannot get back above ground or into my ship.  Dying only causes me to (lose my entire inventory, and then) reload and experience the same thing over again.  Manually reloading my game-save (via closing the application and restarting), of course, merely puts me right back at the beginning of the slow, inevitable fall to my character's ultimate doom.

Other developers know their games are buggy, and they make concessions:  multiple save-files, staggered auto-saves, etc.  Bethesda comes to mind.  Not so with Hello Games--they couldn't be bothered to safeguard their players' character data whatsoever.

I am utterly baffled that this game was seemingly not play-tested to any appreciable degree, yet it somehow managed to pass Sony's certification process.  I really, really liked this game after I started playing it, despite all its flaws, despite what we now know to be half-truths (being generous) from the developers prior to release, and despite what inevitably would have become mind-numbing boredom given a few more tens of hours of gameplay.  But this is a completely unfinished, unpolished, and ultimately unplayable piece of software.  It's obvious, given what I did see and enjoy during my time with this game, that the developers have vision and talent--which makes it all the more depressing that none of that matters since they couldn't be bothered work out the bugs prior to shipping (and/or day-one patching) the game.

I'm not sure who I'm more disappointed with:  the developers themselves, or publisher Sony who is obviously complicit in this farce.  This is a full-priced console game, published by the console-maker:  things have obviously gotten very much out of hand.  Until this incident, I have never thought that the entire concept of preordering games might be fundamentally flawed, but now I am determined to be much more careful with my limited gaming funds.  I feel like I got burned on a failed Kickstarter project that was rushed out in an unfinished state.  So I advise anyone similarly concerned to do what I now plan on doing:
* Don't preorder games, full stop.
* Read reviews from all the major trustworthy gaming publications before making a purchase.
* Check reddit threads, Amazon user reviews, and--for high-profile releases--even news articles for mentions of major issues like crashing, bugs, game-ending flaws, etc.
* Wait for one or even two major patches (beyond any day-one patch) before pulling the trigger on that sweet new game.

I think it's time to move to PC gaming--if my game is going to crash every two hours, it might as well be crashing in glorious 1440p60.  ;-)

<end of Original review>

Edit:
""A customer"" commented about the multiple auto-saves.  This undocumented (since the game auto-loads your most recent save file from the title screen) feature of having precisely *one* previous save file (not two) does exist:  there are merely ""current"" and ""previous"" save files.  Evidently, upon death, yet another auto-save is triggered:  another bad design choice.  Since both saves are in the exact same spot, this does me no good.  Both my saves are in the exact same doomed location, but minutes apart.  There is no third save file.  My character is still completely unplayable."
868,1,"Thousands of reviews have probably gone through with their own disdain as to why ME3 was such a disapointment but I would rather first talk about the good things vs the utterly horrible.

1. Great shooting -  Its not like ME2 where you could charge and shoot, you'll have to use cover and sometimes mild tactics in order to finish your missions. I don't think i didn't loathe one fire fight in any segment of the game. 4 Stars for action.

2. A realistic Shepard:  This time around, he's not really so clean and the choices aren't so open and shut. You even have to consider that Shepard him/herself is also suffering from PTSD as well as the many lives he's seen lost along with all of the death and destruction from  ME1 to ME2.  Mark Meer does the best peformance of Shepard to date, he seemed to be very engaged into the dialouge he expresses and it fits well with the mood and dark surrounding of ME3.

3. Graphics are always a plus, I don't think I'm so detailed that I woudl claim a huge difference, but the worried thoughts after people played the demo suggested it was going to be clumsy or somewhat unfinished looking... however I think they did a great job creating new enviorments both destroyed and maintained.

5. Lots of weapon vareity --- and although some were questionably useless, there was enough different upgrades to make you at least feel there was some upgrading/growing stronger as the player went along.

6. Flowing action --- great dialouge.  I heard some complain about the dialouge. Not too many wheeles per say. I didn't mind what I had, there wasn't  THAT much dialouge however... most likely because at the end of the day, unfortuantely, the more fast pased --- button smashing and less talk players grabbed EA's attention and therefore, we got served  Gears of Mass Effect. It is what it is.

7. Well lets see.....7....7.....

You know what?  Lets keep it at 6 because after all that, it doesn't practically matter at some point. The poor so called RPG has de-evolved into a cash pit for Multiplayer fans to shoot at eachother all day until they get bored and go back to MW, leaving the husk called Mass Effect as a laughable punch line at the bargain bin.  Why lie to you consumer? You'll end up a dollar short and a few hours less of your life, having put too much energy into a plot that never was going to finish correctly and an influence from  Big-V.

Just stay away from the game unless you can get it for 20.00 --- do your self a big favor.

I am not spoiling anything. If your just a casual gamer you may like it, if you are a hard core fan, you won't. And thats the bottom line.

1 star.  I don't need to add on to what was said, its all true in the end. All true.  Darn shame to fumble such a beautiful set of games but... what can I say, its a shooter's world these days. Most people want explosions, map packs, and numerals raising to what ever score you want to rant and rave about along with digital medals --OK --- hey what ever floats your boat but geez -- you have to bleed into everything these days?  I rest my case.

Could care less who doesn't like this post,  Mass Effect 3  is  Mass Deffect 3.  To each their own though, these are only my small opinions and you can do what ever you wish....

...but Bio Ware... you really did bad son...you really did bad.

The only thing left for one to do is to get killed by  Mauraduer Sheilds, now there is a Hero of Mass Effect --- he tries very well to help you out, if you take the hit, I suggest you leave it at that.

End.

Added Content:

I don't think  The CE Edition should even get a Star becaaauuuuseee  ----  DRUM ROLL ----  YOUR COPY OF THIS GAME WILL EVENTUALLY BE NULL IN VOID DUE TO THE "" BLACK HOLE "" BUG THAT WILL PREVENT YOU FROM EVEN PLAYING THE GAME, UNLESS YOU GET A NEW GAME TAG FOR THE XBOX --- AND GUESS WHAT?!? YOU CANT EVEN USE THE EXTRA CONTENT NOR THE DLC, BECAUSE IT WON'T ALLOW YOU TOO THANKS TO EA SERVERS!!!  ISNT THAT GREAT?

BioWare really messed gammers up. I certainly hope they treat Dragon Age 3 better than they gutted and knifed  ME3.  For their profit sake!"
869,1,"Pros: Good graphics

Cons: Every possible thing you can think of that is not graphic related. Single player is short and a joke. It takes less than 5 hours of total game play on the hardest difficulty. There is no replay value like the first Modern Warfare provided. The online play is an absolute disaster. Every single online match is rampant with cheaters and connection problems. There is nothing you can do about a cheater. You can't ban cheaters or remove them from a game. If you are not the host of the game you can expect serious lag.

If I had purchased anything else for $60 and it performed like this product I would have received a full refund."
870,1,"Like Mass Effect from EA before it (and unfortunately a number of other recent titles), EA has infected this with ""Activation"" DRM. They get your money, but you don't own a copy. You can only install/reinstall it if you have an internet connection, their server is running (it won't be forever), and you haven't installed it twice before (which you could end up doing just deciding what system to run it on).

Completely unacceptable. Buy games where you actually OWN a copy of the game after spending money."
871,1,Disappointing  Solitaire Overload had many solitaire games but the graphics and the fun of it compared to other games that are ds was simply disappointing.
872,1,"I downloaded the demo of this game because I really enjoyed civilization revolution. Shortly after playing the game I realized how horrible it is. How can a city defend itself against enemy warriors by itself. Really in real life if a army attacks an undefended city they are captured and put into martial law. I attempted to destroy a city state at the begining of the game, and found it took a retarded amount of time. The minute I declared war on them the English began to defend them. With the crappy way they designed war I find the game takes way too long to play. I recommend everyone send the game back and kick whoever sold it to them in the junk."
873,1,"This game is dum. All you do is go around looking for Mario.
There's no action, no fun, no nothing. I can't beleive people bought this boring, pointless, and funless waste of money."
874,1,I downloaded it twice and spent hours searching on the web for fixes and still is not working .  Went to walmart and purchased the game and it worked.  Xbox game is the way to go instead of pc.

878,1,"Ok, I'm a little bad with Geography and thought this would be a fun way to learn some.  WRONG.  This thing is boring, and the worst part is that it doesn't even teach you.  You basically have to KNOW Geography before you LEARN Geography.  If it does teach you, they set it up so bad that you can't even figure out what section that is in. How hard is it to set up world map, and if you tap on it, it tells you what part of the world, and some information about it.  THEN after you learn, it can test you.  I'm not sure how this is for Grades 1-4, but your kids will hate it."

880,1,"Awkward control set up, even though you can change it, coupled with annoying voice acting, average story, and weak game play. Not to mention that even on easy it's frustratingly difficult and filled with annoying, cheap deaths. Do not bother buying this game. It's absolute trash."
881,1,"only buy if you like platformer games, lots of wall running and timed jumping and mech games.  otherwise it is just horrible."
882,1,"This review is for the game functionality and not for the campaign. Yes, the campaign is great for Resistance 3. I have played all of the Resistance games and they have all been great. But I purchased this specifically for the online portion. You wouldn't think that if you buy a relatively recent game that the online portion would no longer work. You can only play the campaign so many times before you want to know where you stand amongst your fellow players. If you can't do that, then they have no business selling the product to unsuspecting customers like myself. Given that this game only came out only three years ago, and still on the shelves of many stores, Sony should not be shutting down its servers for this game. To purchase this game brand new and only to find that a major part of it is no longer functional is a total letdown. In an age where publishers such as Activision keep their servers running for games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops that came out four years ago and at the same time still serving the other Call of Duty games from Black Ops to Ghost this should not be. Sony with its deep pocket should be able to continue serving the Resistance community. They chose to go the in the wrong direction and follow businesses such as EA whose business practice has been to nickel and dime customers and give them less for their money. Producing a game such as Resistance 3 and then pulling the plug on the customers is simply, to put it short, bad business practice. As such, I will no longer be purchasing any more Resistance iterations ever again. I am sure that they will do the same to the Resistance 4 customers."

887,1,"This headset is the ""old"" 2010 AX Pro (single power supply) model, it is not the new 2011 revision, that is shown in the main images on the left on Amazon's product page. I am awaiting information as to why it was miss-advertised, and if the new model that is depicted is available from Amazon. Will update the review with more information, as I get it. Will change rating/info depending on the product's availability, for now, I am treating the old revision as another incorrectly sent item. The main reason why I purchased the headset from amazon was due to the fact that I contacted Amazon rep's and received a confirmation that the product is the new 2011 revision, which has better headset cable quality, and a better sounding mic, and some other minor enhancements such as swivel speaker pieces (that the olde model did not have, and a inline controller that is more comfortable to use.

Update 21/12/2011:

Looks like Amazon removed the ""2011 model"" images, and replaced them with old ones, from the old series...

Update 1/25/2012:

Contacted Amazon reps again, regarding the fact that the previous rep never followed up on checking if the correct item is being sold, and I also saw the new model images on Amazon(after Amazon removed them and replaced them with old photos). I was told that the item sold is the old Tritton ax pro version, so looks like Amazon is still misrepresenting the item sold, since they still do not offer the new model of the headset that is depicted in the images. DO NOT BUY THE AX PRO FROM AMAZON if you want the new model! The rep wasted an hour of my time, and acted as if nothing happened, even though Amazon is advertising a product (directly sold by them) they do not carry."

891,1,"Sorry, I hate caps lock. Know what I hate more? Electronic Arts.

This game, plain and simple, is UNPLAYABLE without a HDD (you CANNOT use a formatted memory stick for this) with at least 7.3GB of free space on it. If you have the 2GB, 4GB or original slim without an additional Microsoft branded hard drive, you CANNOT play this game. At all. The end.

This is simply pathetic on behalf of Electronic Arts. They're selling a product with absolutely no forward notice to an enormous percentage of Xbox 360 owners have no way of using this product. Both discs must be installed - there is no ""playing it in non-HD."" This is tantamount to selling a car that can only take diesel fuel without mentioning it to anyone until they open the gas flap to see a small ""diesel only"" sticker. Totally inexcusable.

This is twice in 6 months that I've spent $60+ on an EA game that was a complete and utter embarrassment to the entire tech world. NHL15 on the 360 was flat-out copy & pasted from NHL14. New rosters and a new announcer; other than that there's absolutely no way it should be it's own game.

EA's tech support doesn't speak English. Their website is completely unmanned and they laugh when people bring complaints to their knowledge. You cannot return video games once the seal has been broken so I'm going to sit here with my chocolate-covered thumb while their marketing teams put out false advertisements in commercials and stage misleading promotional campaigns.

The cover of this game says it's for Xbox 360. I own a 4GB Xbox 360 and it is unplayable. There is nothing else left to say."
892,1,"As I write this on my laptop, I sit with some friends that run a major retail supply warehouse. We started playing this game yesterday and are still laughing our A**es off at how terrible this game is.

FARM FRENZY
SNIPER GHOST WARRIOR
ALIEN RAGE

Yes, those despicable things. And they dare to make yet another.

Here are just some of the wonderful surprises waiting for you -

Completely mentally challenged enemy AI - they almost help kill themselves as you shoot them down.
Horrible video graphics quality. Think back about 10 years ago.
Terrible glitches - disappearing floors that let you see through the game level, weapons that vanish and it seems as though you are shooting bullets from your finger tips (sounds cool, I know but it isn't).
Bland, lifeless levels.
No depth of plot or story to pull you into it.
The FAIL list goes on and on.

You have been warned!"
893,1,the gaming  controls are  horrible the counter moves and blocking moves are off. It makes the game less about skill and more about luck or randomness this games  will never be  better than  any  street fighter type of game
894,1,"I've had nothing but problems with this game and/or the Motion Plus add-on when combined with the Nunchuk.  I'm at a loss here....  The games look like they could be fun, if only we could play them.

I have four controllers, and four motion plus add-ons, and three nunchuks.  (Obviously this limits us to three people for games that require the Nunchuk, which is fine.)  The problem is that only one of my Nunchuks works with the Motion Plus.  The other two work okay without the Motion Plus, and the Motion Pluses all work okay without the Nunchuks.  Combine them though, and only one works.  No good at all for three kids.  I've tried moving around the Motion Plus and Nunchuks, and it's very consistent."

897,1,"so what's up with this Legacy bundle?

First off, I do not see any legacy attached to this.

If by legacy they mean slapping on old games to the console, then I suppose you can call it that.

The console is just a regular black ps3, they didn't even bother painting it or giving it a GT design.

This would be good for poor people, who have not been able to afford a ps3 til now."
898,1,"Here is my checklist of features that games need to be playable:
- Pause. I am an adult. I have to fix my own food, get clean, shop, answer the phone. Adult stuff. Phone rings I can't whine, ""Mom, get the phone."" I am old and need to eat right, make meals, exercise, go to the dentist, use the bathroom etc, and sometimes NOW, not later. No pause, no play. This game has no pause.
- Fair respawn amount. You get tossed back to your ship after some few minutes of inactivity. You must rekill everything you just did before the phone rang. Some respawns are 10-20 minutes of refighting the same battle.
- Side missions to help you level up in case you are having a hard time with some enemy or other. In Destiny, you can redo old missions or go to an arena where Bill Nighy drones on about retaking area A or B.
Without a pause, no game is playable for me.

To be honest this playstation camera is completely useless at the moment. No apps or games r using this device responsibly.
At first I thought this would be the sony kinect but if u see the hardware inside it's not comparable with kinect 2.0.
Ps4 is ok but this cam is useless."
901,1,"Hate it. The gameplay changes ruin this game. You are supposed to be a badass assassin, but they've taken away all of your fighting prowess! No more counter kills, no more instant kills with smoke bombs, no more using your hidden blade in combat. They make it so difficult to fight in this game and what's worse is that they just load a ton of them on you in almost any encounter! The game is designed to force you to spend money to upgrade your equipment just so you can survive. Enemies deal an insane amount of damage, even weak ones! I've played every Assassin's Creed game and enjoyed them, but this, this is a piece of poop. I die so often, overwhelmed by enemies that you have to hit soooo many times (they love to block about 60-80% of your strikes) to kill. It is horrible! I don't feel like an assassin, what I feel is stupid for buying this game"
902,1,"Save your money. I have tried to find something positive to say about this game but I can't. This has to be one of the worst games I have played in years (and I play them all). It is unimaginative, repetitive, quickly becomes boring and frustrating after you (and I am not exaggerating) do the same missions 30 times, climb the same towers 50+ times, see the same graphic cutaway 50+ times, save the same person in the crowd 30+ times, etc. Also you are not completely ""playing"" the game, every 15 minutes or so it cuts away to a poorly written hack story line that you are forced to sit through. The sad part is this had the potential to be something great open world design and fairly good graphics. To be perfectly honest I am bitter and angry that I spent 50 bucks on this garbage of a game. Ubisoft should be embarrassed of this release and fire the designers."
903,1,"I finally played this today.  Spent years looking forward to it, ever since I heard the hint of a new Battlefront.  There's no story mode.  Or any substance in the slightest.

Sixty dollars for no LAN play, no chat rooms, pay-to-download DLC (remember when you could download maps for free in EVERY OTHER BLIZZARD RTS?), a bizarre friends system, and of course, one-third of the Starcraft 2 story with the promise of the other two in expansions. It's almost supernatural, how insulting it all is.

The best part is that Blizzard has said publicly that they're fine with all of it, that Activision hasn't limited them at all. I can't help but get the image that Activision execs were holding assault rifles to the Blizzard rep's head as he announced that.

Shameful."
906,1,"The Wii will destroy the card at random.

All saves on the card will corrupt.  They will remain corrupt when moved to a 59 or a 251.  They remain corrupt when using the card on a REAL Gamecube.  The card remains corrupted when all saves on the card have been erased and new saves are started using ONLY a real Gamecube.

It's a $20 white brick.

The background:

I purchased this 1019 memory card when I bought my Wii.  I never had a Gamecube, so I thought I'd mess around with some Gamecube games due to the Wii's backwards compatibility.  Deceptively, with no issues, I played several Gamecube games on my Wii over the course of a few months.

Then I played F-Zero GX with 1019 on Wii.  From that point on, my 1019 was bricked and all my saves were lost.  Are certain games' save mechanisms not compatible with Wii/1019?  Is the Wii randomly introducing electric shock to corrupt the card?  The cause may not be known, but I have a $20 white brick.  It can't be formatted.

I'll consider buying another someday, but only to use in a real Gamecube."

909,1,The best part of this game is when you get to play the first room of metal gear solid 1 from the old playstation version. The rest is just hours of people talking in cutscenes about near-magical nanomachines.
910,1,"they was this controller was discribed was not in the condition as stated. The color was very faded and scratched up, the pads on the joy stick had extreme wear and holes in it. Look like a garage safe reject. If this is the quality they sell then they have lost me as a customer."
911,1,"I was really disappointed with this game.  The controls were lame and so was the story line.  Basically you run around killing aliens and destroying any ""trace"" of crashed space ships.  It was painfully easy as well.

One annoying thing in particular is that you had to use the R and L buttons to see where you were going, even when you were moving, instead of the character's perspective changing automatically as you moved.

I was expecting a good shooter or action game like God of War or The Warriors. This game is neither.

The bright side:  I got $10 bucks for it at a school flea market."
912,1,I ordered and received a Saudi Arabia version instead of the USA one.  It did not state this in the description at all.
913,1,bungie is not having new DLC on the last-gen consoles so don't buy if you have a ps3 or xbox 360
914,1,"I'm a big fan of the Max Payne series and anxiously awaited this games release.  I was worried about the reviews saying the cut scenes were too long and frequent, and sure enough they were.  I put up with it, but I hated being forced to watch them over and over when I died and respawn (it get really old fast).  I made it as far a one challenge where I failed and faild and failed and I'm a major experienced gamer from way back who likes hard mode.  The game feels laggy often at the worst moments of battle and bottom line for me is after turning it off so frustrated I wanted to break the disk in two, and then coming back the next day after 'cooling off' I was back at that same frustration level again in no time.

I can put up with a lot of frustration in a game, but when I reach a point where no matter what I do I can't get past that challenge the game is over for me.  With no save point as in this game you're just forced to watch the same long cut scene over and over and put up with what appears to be an impass.  Games are supposed to be fun, and this one for me was a torture of frustration."
915,1,it is pretty fun game but I don't like that this name is devil may cry and they completely changed the story line it bull that they did that to me I couldn't play it anymore once I new that killed the story
916,1,this was the worst wirless device I have ever purchased. it was right next to the wireless router and still it woudl not poick it up. The sensor would not connect with the controllers. I ended up throwing it away and buying a plugged in one - a million times better
917,1,I have size 10 and a half feet and i can not fit my feet anywhere on this board without the game freezing and telling me to stay off the edges!  So basically it is entirely unusable and was a complete waste of money. Cant express my dissatisfaction enough.
918,1,"I'm seeing a disturbing trend in games featuring the Simpsons. First there was ""Simpson's Road Rage"" which was Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters, which was half decent. But when they tried to apply the Simpsons to the Tony Hawk formula, they fell flat on their face, much like you will find youself doing quite often if you play this game. The controls so horrible that they render the game practically unplayable. The physics will not allow you to do what you'd like to do, making many of the goals completely unrealistic. The only thing this game has going for it are its graphics.
Bottom line: If you are going to buy this game, make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the controls, because otherwise you will put it down after fifteen minutes and never have a desire to play it again. If you are a big fan of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series and big Simpson's fan, do not buy this game thinking you will get the best of both worlds because you will be very disappointed."
919,1,I don't like it because no one can hear me beacause the mic is on my check and no where near my mouth. Is there anything you can do to help me? Right now I advise people not to buy this product. This is a disappointment. Please contact me ASAP.
920,1,I cancelled my preorder when i discovered that this game is censored.
921,1,"I wanted to like this game, the story line is decent and the graphics are good but navigating the screens is painful. They have taken what could have been a good game and ruined it by not paying attention to some basic navigation problems. The cursor indicates that you can move in a direction by showing shoe prints when you hold the cursor over a hot spot. But in this game the hot spots are tiny or in a lot of cases missing. This makes something that should be simple, moving around the screens, very frustrating. In one screen after 5 minutes of searching I couldn't find any hot spots that would allow me to move forward into the market area, even though it was evident that it was where I needed to go. So I gave up and started randomly clicking in the screen, which eventually allowed me to move forward, but again, no hot spots to indicate where I could move to from that position. So more random clicking to try to get to one of the booths in the market. After having to do this to move several times the screen finally changed to show the market from a different angle and at that point I had navigational hot spots again. The tiny hot spots also caused a problem with figuring out what items I was supposed to pick up or look at. It caused me to miss several items in certain screens. And in a few cases the hot spot was completely off the item altogether, causing some confusion as to which item I was to pick up or look at. Another annoying problem was that often my character would stand right in front of what I needed to look at or touch. So I had to keep clicking the screen around her to try to move her out of the way in order to get to the item in question. So unless you have an infinite amount of time and patience, try some other game."
922,1,"The instruction manual was missing, so I sent it back."
923,1,Poorly made too touchy the plug and play doesn't work with it. The rechargeable battery packs don't work or register in the controller either. Save your money go buy one from Microsoft yourself or a real one from walmart this is a knock off!!!
924,1,i don't know how good it is b/c i couldn't play it.  I think that the user should have put on the description that it doesnt work on the 360
925,1,returning don't work
926,1,"It is an EXACT copy of Medal of Honor Allied Assault and the expansion packs that followed. Don't waste your money.
They didn't even try to make it orginial. It is just the same old, scripted mission action repackaged.
I enjoyed the game. I liked it...but I did not think it was worth my money.
There are some new things that are nice...but that list is so short, it is still not worth $40 or $50!!!
DON""T BELIEVE THE HYPE>>>>>>>>
Download the demo or borrow a copy from a friend and TEST DRIVE it first people.
If you like it...then buy it but don't rush out because of the overhyped 5 star votes in here!!!"
927,1,cheep
928,1,"The right button gave out after less than 6 months of constant (but unagressive) use. I think the supports on the right button just broke because it's really hard to get the clicks to register. I'm dissappointed, as I really do have very few requirements for a mouse except to work without lag and to be durable, which this mouse clearly is not. I don't throw my mouse, I don't drop it, but I do use it a lot (everyday for a few hours) and the fact that it broke in only 6 months is really quite pathetic."
929,1,So boring !
930,1,"it worked for a little while ,and then then i would not work and then it started working again and then stoped working.i stoped useing it....ron"
931,1,"I knew that the pink controllers came out a long time ago but I had figured that buying one of these batteries to match my wife's controller would be perfect and they were a greal deal at only $5. However after charging it overnight on the ""official"" microsoft charger and placing it in the controller it only lasted one play session. The next day, tried to use it and nothing...no power or even a low batt light on the controller. These are probably left over old stock from back in 2006-7 when thery came out. Do not buy unless you just want a cheap batt to charge and play once per day. But really, why would you? I also purchased the Nyko ones and they are great!"
932,1,"I bought this when it came out. But my PC would not install it. It said there was a corrupted .dll file on the disc. I tried multiple DVDs and they all said the same thing. All of the other LEGO games installed fine in the past, but this one would not.

Disney tech support did actually try to help, but with no avail. I blame Disney since it was the first one they were associated with.

I have just recently ordered it for Wii and I will play it at the laundry mat every other three weekends. So it will take awhile to finish it.

I'm sure the game is fun, just like the others, but it would not install and that is very frustrating."
933,1,Because it wasn't what I expected
934,1,"be aware. they changed from physical copy to digital copy for the battlefront game
if you preordered, you did not notice, until its to late and you already have the bundle
sony and amazon should inform everyone on this.

i just can't find old amazon listings on archive.org. so i used the gamestop one as example."
935,1,this was an okay game. not one of the best racing games i played but it was alright. the graphics and scenry was cool though. but i wouldn't buy it.
936,1,"I'm a real person, not a paid critic.  I rented this game and couldn't play it longer than ten minutes b4 my real life excited me more than wasting my time on this crap.  I was excited when I saw the commercial and thought it would be a great game. I couldn't believe when they made the game like Final Fantasy where I push triangle and then watch the characters try to do the button I chose for them. I write try b/c as you wrote half the time they wouldn't even do what you push.  I'll repeat myself.  I just can't play a game where off to the side of the screen it tells me to press triangle to attack or square to do magic, or circle to heal and then after I make my choice I have to wait three seconds to watch and see if my character will do it in a battle. I feel like these types of games should be banished from our century b/c they're too elementary."
937,1,"Diablo 3, well I think it is obvious we all had high hopes. I was not completely disappointed with the game, it was ok. What I am disappointed with is the fact that my account was (just like all the others reporting) was hacked and everything stolen from my characters. In all the years I've been playing MMORPG's and online games I've never had my information stolen, yet with little effort it seems hackers can gain access to Blizzards database and take your info. Your login is also your email address. Blizzard then likes to offer you extra security for some money. I've never needed it with any other service and I certainly am not going to pay for it from Blizzard. Being hacked makes the game entirely unworthy of your time or the stress of having your information compromised."
938,1,"Crashes on startup, then when you get it to finally work, crashes in the middle of heavy action.  Don't waste your money...not even for a dollar or less!!!"
939,1,"Plastic build, minimal adjustments, low quality software, painful to wear for an extended period of time, not recomending these. I would honestly rather spend the extra $$$ and get a logitech product."
940,1,"saints row took a huge dive! I use to love these games! I thought the last one was far fetched but this one pushes it. The story is ridiculous, the graphics are terrible and playing as Gat isn't nearly as cool as you would think it would be. This game was a huge let down. Also the controls suck. Rent the game before you buy, even if you are a huge fan."
941,1,Stay FAR AWAY.  Read comment below...
942,1,"Why does this game garner so much high praise? The characters are awful and unlikable. The script is terrible. Your ""choices"" make no difference in the end, when you are given just 2 options, each of which were unaffected by the choice you made previously. I was actually unable to continue past the first chapter because I hated it so much. My girlfriend powered through just because she wanted to see how it ended. She was as unimpressed as I was. This game is total garbage."
943,1,I throughly did not like this game at all. Unless you enjoy being on a set track and taking pictures of pokemon with a limited amount of film and giving them food or bombing them or playing music for them and taking more pictures. Then this game is not for you.
944,1,"Don't believe me?  Take a stroll over to the NCAA 2003 message board at EA Sports' website and examine the multiple discussions over the XBox version both freezing and resulting in ""disc dirty/damaged"" errors during saving/loading.
Coulda been a great game.  If not for a little thing called ""quality control."""
945,1,Flawed. Returned.
946,1,"Item DID NOT WORK. I'm extremely unhappy with my transaction, I knew I should have went with a Microsoft charger. But I suppose you get what you pay for. I really hope this was an isolated incident and they aren't selling broken chargers to everyone knowingly."
947,1,did not come with headset!!!!!
948,1,"Turned my wonderful 5 year old nephew into a vidiot. Ok that's too strong, he's a bright kid, socialble kid, but he became too obsessed by this game and the figurines. He had about 10 or so of them and always wanted more. He gets locked in, and ignores anything but the game, goes in guns blazing, player dies, puts the next character on the portal, rinse and repeat. When all his characters are gone he bugs mom and dad and his uncle for new characters from the store $15 bucks a pop. His parents had to take away his video game privledges and he's now doing more constructive things like reading, puzzles, drawing, etc.

These games aren't constructive kids games, don't fool yourself, thats the point they are hard enough that you die quicker than normal, so you need more pieces to stay alive longer. Why do you think Disney went scrambling to make this game? Skylanders was monopolizing the market making money hand over fist.

The point of the developers making these games isn't to make a fun game for your child, it's about selling figurines.

Solution ? Stick with a fantastic Lego video game instead. Lego Star Wars, Lego Batman, Lego Harry Potter, Lego Pirates of the Carribean, etc.  If he/she is a little older the Mario games are fantastic as well."
949,1,"This thing is way too old to cost more than $80. It's also pathetic on how Nintendo practice making sure you use this. They will have games they claim support the other controllers but you will certainly points in the game where it requires a gamepad. So God forbid you lost or broke yours, your console is useless now. Also games that are multi-player require several GAMEPADS. So you have to pay $1 each. The hardware in these things are trash, resolution is not even in 1080, touch screen technology is very old as well. Nintendo is stealing. Thank God their console is doing bad. I regret ever buying this console. All it does is sit collecting dust for a year until one good game comes out."
950,1,"This game is probably the worst game I have ever played. Paper mario is my favorite n64 game and I love paper mario 2 but this game is a disgrace to the series. No lv ups when battling so there's no reason to battle enemies, no partners, no awesome music, if you don't have the right sticker you can't be certain bosses. Yeah skip this one is you value your time and money. I had high hopes for this game but they were slashed."
951,1,"Worked great once, then I started getting lines on my tv while playing.  The next time I turned my wii on, the picture would flicker.  After doing some research, I found that this is caused by 3rd party power supplies.  I switched back to the original power pack and the lines and flickering went away.  Not worth the money."
952,1,"The receiver I received did not work.  Had to return.  Amazon did great with the return as usual, but beware of this particular product/seller."
953,1,"This game obviously isn't a finished product. It's full of glitches, and bugs. It is hardly worth more then ET for the Atari 2600.

It isn't worth it, even if you want a time wasting game. It's supposed to be a racing game, but it isn't. Your opponent doesn't even move. There is a fixer that you can download, but even then you always win. And when you do, you get greeted by a delightful "" YOU'RE WINNER ! "". You can easily move off track, and nobody would care. You can FLY THROUGH NOTHING. This game has no barriers, you can even pass through everything, including bridges. You can even run thousands of miles in a circle, and stop in a microsecond.

If you want to get the game for a laugh, buy it, but buy it somewhere else. It's overpriced on Amazon."
954,1,"I hate my vita, it's geared towards Japanese gamers only. It's cumbersome, unresponsive controls, terrible selections of games, VERY expensive games. The Vita is slow, and don't get me started on the charging part :(. It is also very outdated reg services, apps...it has limited languages choice for God sake. Buying it was a mistake I regret a lot"
955,1,"Playing this is like watching dragon ball z, there is a lot of dialogue and it can take a bit of time to get through. The quests are often menial tasks that get to be time consuming and have little entertainment value. Almost four hours of cut scenes and dialogue with little fighting to wrap up the game. The difficulty on normal is well above what most games would consider normal. Normal battles are under challenging while boss fights can kill your party in seconds."
956,1,Does not work correctly with xbox
957,1,"Wow, I don't know where to start.  This game was just ported horribly from 360 to PC.  So much so that they should've just thrown it in the trash instead of release it.  I'll start off with the fact that they must've been on something good when they decided not to add 1680x1050 resolution support for this game.  I mean, what the heck is up with that?  I think the majority of gamers will have monitors with a resolution of 1680x1050, in other words, most 20""-22"" monitors, yet they didn't add support for it.  Hardcore gamers might have a 1920x1080, or 1980x1200 display, but what about those of us who thought 22"" was sufficient enough.  Okay, so I get over that issue by choosing the next resolution down that maintain's a 16:10 aspect ratio (1280x800), so the game looks OK at this resolution, but everyone knows that putting a LCD Monitor on anything other than it's native resolution really makes it quite blurry.

Ok, so I accept the blurriness but the game doesn't even feel like it's reaching 20FPS.  What's up with that.  I mean, my computer is pretty up to date with all recent technology.  I have not one, but two, GTX 280's in SLi, as well as the newest Phenom II processor released which is at a stock of 3.0GHz, however I have it overclocked to 3.6GHz, and I also have 8GB's of 800MHz DDR2 RAM.  You can imagine this system is quite awesome for Crysis, running usually a minimum of around 40-45PFS, even during intense scenes, and getting up to a max of around 80FPS.  So, why, does Saints Row 2, which is quite inferior in graphics, play at 20FPS and less?  Not sure myself but it sure does suck.  Sure, turning graphics down to low makes it run at a better FPS, but I didn't spend well over $1,500 on my PC to play a game on low settings.  I'm quite appalled by this, though I suppose I can't complain seeing as their competitor (Rockstar) didn't do too much better themselves on GTA IV.

Now, I regret not getting Saints Row 2 on 360 when it came out, because I was oh so sure the PC version would be amazing...boy was I wrong.  So anyway, those problems out of the way, there are still tons of other glitches and things that others have mentioned before.  One of the most prominent being items popping up out of no where.  Now, I understand it's a huge city, just like in GTA IV, but is it too much to ask for items to ""pop in"" maybe when I'm still five feet away instead of about one foot away.

All in all, the two games I were waiting for the most on PC (GTA IV, and Saints Row 2) both failed for me.  GTA IV is playable, but it seems much better on 360 than PC."
958,1,Won't install. Locked up my computer Then it corrupted the Flight Simulator X. Horrible Got it with Gold Edition. Calling Microsoft.
959,1,no manual or code key. game useless.
960,1,"First off, I am a big fan of the GTA series. Ever since GTA III, the sandbox nature of the game, the infinite urban sprawl and the rural backwoods have all been fun to explore, and the game has only gotten better over time. Well, almost.

  GTA IV, on its own, is a fun game, but lacks the depth and vastness of San Andreas, its predecessor. It improves graphically, but I feel certain elements were sacrificed in the process. Otherwise, great story, great gameplay, and excellent attention to detail.

  And if I were reviewing the PS3 version, it would have 5-stars. So, why only one star overall? Well, the first sign of problems came from SecuROM. Now, I hate game pirating as much as anyone, and I think there should be measures in place to prvent it. Invasive, questionably malicious software is not the answer. Second issue comes in the ""Social"" prompt, which plagues the game every time I want to start it up. That is a minor annoyance, but a detraction nonetheless. NOW, let's talk about the BIGGEST annoyance. If you want to autosave, you had better be willing to sign up to Windows Live. That's right, you are basically forced to bump Microsoft's Windows Live numbers if you want to use autosave. That would be like having to sign up for PSN if you wanted to save on that version, or signing up to the Nintendo Store if you wanted to save a game on Zelda. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE, MICROSOFT.

  The next problem is the graphics on the PC. I have a custom-made VAIO, the one where you pick the biggest laptop there, choose the blu-ray, most RAM, fastest processor, best graphics card. This laptop eats most games for lunch. Except, of course, GTA IV. Simply moving around in a small area is a chore, the dialogue is stilted, and driving is difficult. I've checked my settings, and the game is demanding maybe a quarter of my computer's resources... and it is STILL a mess. This isn't a performance issue. This is a sloppy programming issue.

Utterly unacceptable butchering of a good game."
961,1,"I got this game with a $25 gift card to a game store so I figured I wouldn't be out too much if it was as hard as people say.  While I was finishing up another game I found the game guide to this game and thought awesome I'll be ready to attack.  I've spent several hours playing Dark Souls now and I ready to say it sucks.

Having a game guide/watching youtube/ internet cheating is probably the only way you'll make headway.  I read the reviews thinking I'll gut the game out with grit and determination but that's not the case.  For instance after the training level you're plunged into a world with several possible paths.  All but one of these paths will lead you to certain and repeated death.  There is no hint or cause as to how to traverse these areas so a guide is necessary.  Leveling up seems to have little effect as enemies will get you in a state of stun lock if you challenge 2 or more usually.  Keep in mind you can fall from about anywhere and that means you will be starting from a save point generally far away.  If you don't recover your body you've probably lost a great deaL of hard work.

One of my biggest gripes if that you have no clue when sudden death is coming.  Thought you found a secret area.  You'd better hope that enemy you are about to attack doesn't have 3000x your hit points or its bye bye to the last 30 minutes work.

The game isn't challenging or fun. Its basically a trial in what you will put up with.  The camera is whack. The knowledge given to you within the game is lacking and the graphics aren't nearly as good as people say.

If you love pointless dying this is your game, get on the internet, cheat away, then act like you did it on your own."
962,1,"EA, we are disappointed with your cynically manipulative approach to customers. SimCity was badly broken and you have told us repeatedly that you have no plans to fix it - that large cities, for instance, are impossible. Not only have your statements been misleading on a technical level but they also underscore the essential laziness that defines your approach to gaming. Cash farming is what EA does best, and SimCity perpetuates the long-standing tradition.

You're paying EA to rent (not own) a copy of a badly broken game. You're paying to be constantly checked in upon to make sure you're not pirating or cheating or (worst of all) playing offline.

You can encourage this manipulation or you can go play something else. Your choice."
963,1,"And now Atari joins the DRM thralls with a protection scheme so stringent that legitimate buyers won't be able to install the game!

Whether the title is fun on non-PC platforms or not, I don't know (and for those who managed to install, they have realized in shock that multiplayer options have been taken away for PC users). I can't get my copy to install regardless of what I try. If you search the Atari forums, you will find lots of similar complaints and very little in the way of answers. And it doesn't just fail to install for Windows 7 users -- it has failed to do so for customers owning XP and Vista as well."
964,1,"This product was mailed to me and was not appropriate for my Windows 7 computer. First it demanded that I accept unspecified changes ot to my operated system, which I declined, and then it played for a few episodes and froze up the computer. I tried a second time with worse results; it froze up faster. The game itself would be a lot of fun, but this particular issue isn't updated enough to play on my machine, and is a dangerous trouble maker."
965,1,"The download code for the game did not work. To make matters worse, the Blu Ray drive was also non-functional and would not read discs. I am currently waiting for UPS to pick up my unit and for Amazon to send me a replacement."
966,1,"Did not work on my windows 7/64
JL."
967,1,Mic pops and crackles at any volume. It sucks! I purchased these when I watched a bunch of reviews on youtube. I have to say these are crap. I recommend Sades Stereo 7.1  for the PS4. Sades Stereo 7.1  are USB.
968,1,"I was disappointed when I played this game on the X360.  I was hoping for an action-decision-based RPG game from Bioware - along the lines of Mass Effect.

Unfortunately, Dragon Age is a LOT more time-consuming and less fun.  It all comes down to what type of gamer you are, I suppose.  DA is VERY backstory-oriented and expects you to WANT to spend 60% of your total game-playing time speaking with others, scrolling through obvious conversation choices, listening to banter or watching cutscenes.

Unfortunately, that was not what I was looking for, so I did not enjoy this game.  I will stick with KOTOR and Mass Effect."
969,1,"In the history of video games, this is the only console tha burn itself, the three red lights appeared just becouse... 450$ lost in a xbox360 console and the additional control. I'm very far away so i don't have the opportunity to change it or something.

Just for that the xbox360 its the worst video game console ever."
970,1,They really scratch the screen. Not worth it.
971,1,Broke within two months of buying during regular use. Do not buy.
972,1,"I have over 1200 hours on Skyrim. This game is horrid. Even after all the patches I am now purchasing in Dec. 2015 so it has been patched. The graphics are awful, there is no storyline, the missions are a bore they're all fetch missions, combat is awful. I cant even believe Bethesda made this game. There are so many other things wrong I cant even get into it. Such a disappointment."
973,1,It is mindless driving to say the least. It has no focus and I think the concept of this game is stupid.  I downloaded it and deleted it.
974,1,"I hate this damn game, smh...

If some people find this entertaining, well to each his own. This is absolutely nothing like Saints Row 2 and 3, which are the 2 games I have played. I enjoyed those 2 previous games to the fullest, storyline and gameplay. This new Saints Row went way off the edge in fantasy. We're talking aliens, were talking superpowers with your character a la Infamous... it's just not my kind of game. What's even worst is it's cost like $1.00 if I sold it back. Terrible game."
975,1,Noisy piece of junk.
976,1,Bad game
977,1,"Between server failures and unreliable internet connections, this game can be impossible to play. Single player online-only is a horrible idea."
978,1,"""The right-handed design has a soft-touch finish, a rubber thumb grip, and a low-friction braided cable""  Do these companies think we are all born right-handed? Another useless mouse design for ONE group of users, the rest of us? Go away.

If you can only set your engineers to create products for those who are right-handed perhaps you are in the wrong business, or maybe someone should give you the bad news... We're NOT all right-handed, nor do customers take kindly to being discriminated against when shopping.

ONE Star for no left-handed option."
979,1,"I'm never paying full price for an Ubisoft game again.  I've been playing Xbox games for over eight years, and GRFS is the buggiest game I've ever had.

Ubisoft apparently has no problem punishing their best customers so that they can squash the spectre of used game buyers and software pirates.  On the PC side, their games are saddles with an overly-intrusive DRM that makes it difficult for honest customers to play even the single-player campaign.  On the Xbox, where we already pay for Xbox Live, you need to have a Uplay ""online pass"" in order to play multiple.  The problem is that this technology, like all DRM, is broken.  In addition, since the online pass normally costs $10, then your game immediately loses $10 trade-in value if you play the multiplayer even once.

For the past week, my friend and I have tried to continue our co-op campaign, but it doesn't work any more.  Most of the time, the game refuses to connect -- either some nonsense about missing DLC (neither of us have purchased any DLC) or an inability to find the ""host"".  When it does connect, my Xbox hangs as soon as we try to start the mission.

If you go to the Ubisoft forums, you'll find hundreds of people complaining about hangs and crashes.  This game is just plain broken, and there is no indication that Ubisoft is actually trying to fix anything.  This game has been out for three months, so it's completely unacceptable that it's still this broken."
980,1,"Ordered this from Amazon over a month ago.  They had a very long delivery schedule, but OK.  I'm willing to wait.  I had 3 copies on order for myself, a friend, and my wife.  We waited while our other friends simply bought theirs from other distributors or in brick and mortars.  Today (around the time it was supposed to have arrived) I get notified that the order has been canceled due to a ""lack of availability from our suppliers.""  Funny, it seems to be in stock, just at a MUCH higher price than it was when I ordered it over a month ago.  Amazon if you have a pricing error, just TELL ME UP FRONT so I'm not sitting around like an idiot waiting for you to never come through.

The game is okay for an MMO.  Way more fun than trying to get anything from Amazon."

982,1,"Horrible cheesy game. Looks like it should be for 3 year olds,  but is complicated that only adults can play the game."
983,1,"Now, because this is a negative review, most won't find it ""helpful."" Thats OK. For those of you who are seeking to get info about the XBOX Ones console, be forewarned. I just wish someone had shared an HONEST REVIEW containing HALF of the things that I have been through and spared me the TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT and UTTER REGRET that I am now experiencing with this console. Here is a bulleted list of the XBOX One S console's greatest failures:
 You must wait hours to play a new game  each new game MUST first be installed even if you have the disc. And if you have the disc, it must always be inserted into the console for you to play it even though youve downloaded it onto the console.
 You must put in all information before you play for the first time, including your credit/debit card info.
 Like a PC, the console automatically uses a percentage of your space before any game is downloaded. For example, my 2TBs were actually 1.6 TBs available for my use. For the 500 GB consoles, you have just 362 GBs of space available for you to use.
 Games must be updated often. For example, with Call of Duty  Infinite Warfare (COD), updates occur about every three weeks. Some updates take hours.
 You must pay $60 a year to interact online or $10/month or $25/three months.
 Just two months in, the console stopped working because it needed to be directly plugged into an outlet, not a surge protector power strip.
 There are constant advertisements when you first start the console up and during game play.
 You CANNOT PLAY ALL RETRO GAMES on this console. There is no backwards compatibility for the first XBOX consoles games. Whereas Nintendo allows you to play its very first games on its consoles, not so with many games from XBOXs earliest console and beyond.
 If you want extra content for a particular game you must purchase a season pass. This season pass is $40 per game and per profile. So, with COD, if I want to get extra content, I have to pay $40 and that season pass may only be used on MY profile, not my sons. If I want his profile to be able to access the season pass I must pay an ADDITIONAL $40.
 You may only return games just ONCE in a 12-month period of longer, and even this is said to be a courtesy. So be sure about what you purchase BEFORE you buy  Xbox allows you to preview some games, I suggest you play the game before buying it.
 Xbox has the worst customer service of any console that I have ever owned  and I have owned several different consoles. They keep me on hold for half an hour or so on MOST occasions. They must send verification codes to service you and sometimes the codes NEVER arrive. They tell you one thing and you find that they are lying but they never admit that they're lying, of course.
 Poor parental controls are staples of XBOX. Once I tried to check to see if my son had purchased something on his profile and was told that I had no right to his gaming info unless I had his email account name and password.

7/12/17 Wanted to add that after you change your ""gamertag"" once, it costs $10 to do so again. Just a PATHETIC console. BY FAR the WORSE console I could ever IMAGINE being produced. Just awful.

The goal of this review is to help people to understand just what they are getting when they make this purchase. I was patient with this console, and so by the time I faced the FACT that XBOX is NOT the console for my family, Id had this console for well over three months and so all I can do is trade it in. However, trade-in costs are very low: I paid almost $450 for my XBOX One S and can only trade it in for less than HALF that amount - $179. The 30 or 40 games that I paid $80 each for are now worth all of $5 and $10. The LONE good thing about the console is the graphics. But the bad outweighs even that BY FAR. I say skip XBOX One in any form (S or X)  get a Nintendo Switch instead!"
984,1,"1. EA still refuses to enable Widescreen support for its non-sport, non-console titles despite Widescreen monitors becoming more and more mainstream.  Nasty hacks/workarounds are necessary - for BF2 I spent nearly 4 hours just making the game look right and quit resetting resolution on my Widescreen. Even then - it is not as good looking as real widescreen support.

2. EA charges $50 and then as part of the EULA (End User License Agreement) requires that you consent to the display of in-game ads, and installation of spyware/malware which collects your surf habits in order to play online.  I would rather not have a bright neon display selling Coca Cola in a post-apocalyptic future.  Does not fit the setting.  Just an attempt by a greedy publisher to gain money at the expense of, not by helping its customers in enjoying the product.

3. EA leaves bugs that have existed since BF2 in-game, and on release this game has been buggy and patches are few and far between.  If its support of BF2 is any indication - gamers will be disappointed in that patches generally break/unbalance things rather than fixing reported problems.

On a positive note (to earn its one-star) is that the new Titan mode is pretty harrowing and exciting... assuming you are actually able to find a stable server and your system doesn't crash your client randomly.

I for one am boycotting EA titles until customer grievances are redressed appropriately.  Withour your customers - no advertising company will see a point in paying to have their ads in-game."
985,1,"this game is a replicated copy. All ps1 games are on a ""black disc"". this was on a regular cd rom. the game does work on the PS1 but just be warned its not an authentic copy."
986,1,"the lag is horribe on xbone live

for me time from pressing shoot to gun firing on screen- 1.5 seconds.

probably contributed by the weak graphic processor in my guess

its one of those games which are NOT 1080p , exclusively on the xbone, isn't it?"
987,1,"The Star rating above for ""fun"" above should read ZERO stars. Sorry. My bad.

I never write reviews for products I have never even tried--unless something that is relevant to other potential buyers prevents me from trying or owning it, in which case a review is necessary to inform potential buyers. That is the case with Red Alert 3, where the Draconian copy protection issue has indeed prevented me from purchasing a game that I had looked forward to owning with nothing but joyful anticipation for a long, long time--until the day it was released, and EA Games insulted my dignity.

In a world where so many people are quick to give up their dignity in favor of ""security"", ""comfort"", and in this case, the ability to play a video game, I have no choice but to boycott Red Alert 3 and all other EA Games products.

The executives at EA games have never met me. Why then do they assume that I go to work each day to earn money, spend a large sum of that money on one of their video games, and then GIVE what I just paid for away to thousands of people whom I've never even met on the internet? For that matter, why do they assume that I would ever know HOW to do something like this, if I wanted to? This is an insult to my dignity, and an overestimation of my technical skills, for no good reason.

Furthermore, calling those lawbreakers who DO copy software ""pirates"" is a profound insult to every victim of real PIRATES throughout history--people who have been disfigured, raped, murdered, and sold into slavery. I'm sorry, but calling a paying customer a potential ""pirate"" is far more of an injury to me, than enduring the ""suffering"" of never owning a game that I otherwise would have gladly purchased at full price.

Let your own conscience be your own guide. But make no mistake about it--the DRM issue with Red Alert 3 IS relevant, and it IS grounds for boycotting all EA Games products. Not only has EA Games totally ruined this gaming experience for me, but they have even corrupted my memory of fun and comradery that I enjoyed playing previous versions of Command & Conquer with my friends over the years. EA Game executives have taken so very much away from us. Why then would anyone who possesses even a shred of self-worth even consider purchasing another one of their products?

I give this product 0 stars, because the manufacturer has created conditions that provide zero pleasure from this product."
988,1,"Most XBOX users are used to controls that were developed with halo and have now pretty much carried over to most games on the market.  Move with left stick, look with the right.  Well, this game is a blast to the (frustrating) past.  You move around with one stick, then have to hold a button in order to switch to aim mode (which takes a whole second), and you use the same stick now to aim, while you stand still and get beat up by zombies.  It takes a few seconds just to shoot a guy standing 6 inches in front of you.  Don't even get me started with the horrible AI your partner has...

I think fans of the franchise will love this game, controls are similar to the (4 year old) resident evil 4 game.  For someone new to the series, I urge you to try the demo before forking a lot of money at this game.  If you can get used to the controls, it's a decent game (not great), and pretty short, but getting used to those controls can be torture."
989,1,"It's a very nice mouse, especially for the money. It has a button that changes the DPI scaling, I personally don't find the light to be too bright, and the wiring sheath is nice woven material. My only complaint (and why I took a star), my cable arrived and it looked like a rodent got a hold of the cable sheathing, so I have random thread pulls all over the place. It doesn't affect the mouse at all it seems, so I assume the internal cabling is fine. The packaging was also very nice. All in all, I would recommend this to someone I know.

UPDATE: 6 Months Later
The mouse still works for most part, but the left mouse button has a tendency to double click on it's own. This mouse was on my laptop and underwent light use (mostly turn based games, web browsing, and photoshop). It's a really nice mouse when it's new, but it doesn't seem to hold up well."
990,1,I had big hopes for Fifa 16 but after the price cap in Ultimate team I knew that all they care about is $$ not the costumer happines EA failed and I tried the game I rented it from gamefly the gameplay is bad you won't believe that this is the new Fifa we were all hoping for ..just stick to Fifa 15 or you can buy PES 16 it's really good
991,1,This game was loaded iwth malware and set off all of my virus alarms when I tried to load it.  Not worth sending back so I just tossed it.
992,1,These replacement batteries for Xbox One controllers are cheap and perform poorly.  They lose their charge quickly and take too long to reach a full charge.  They are not worth buying.  The only positive is the nice blue LED as opposed to the orange/white LEDs of the original batteries.  Even the micro USB cables that come with them are flimsy and have a poorly constructed insulating jacket.
993,1,"You know, I've played a lot of MMOs...but this one has frustrated me the most...it's beautiful, and the game is a great RPG to level 50 but the endgame is GARBAGE...be prepared for endless grind in a few horrible dungeons, extremely poor planning and bad difficulty curves on ""Titan"" and other bosses, 2 hour queues and general boredom while you wait. There are so many other good games out there... I guarantee you are going to end up as irritated as I am if you expect this to be more of a standard RPG with about 20 hours of actual gameplay. As an RPG, this deserves a higher rating but as an MMO it FAILS. Bad work, Squeenix...stick to single player games."

Whoever approved this game to be ""acceptable"" for Xbox/Microsoft standards should be FIRED!!!...
This game is just absolutely horrendous and needs to just be removed from the shelves through a massive recall, pilled up in the backyard of the person who approved this game for sale, and burnt in the name of all that's wrong with the world today.  What's bad about this game??  The question should be, ""What's good about it?""....nothing, and I mean nothing.  The DVD disc could be used as a coaster for drinks I suppose...but that's the only good thing I can think of.  I would have chosen ""no stars"" for this piece of flaming poo....but I'm forced to choose 1 star.  Oh well, nobody's perfect I guess.

1000,1,"What's better than a driving game that makes you constantly close text boxes plastered all over the screen so you don't crash? Yeah. That's what you can expect  with this trash game. Come on EA. You're killing it, I mean, killing your franchise!

Anyway...I can't believe what EA has done to destroy this beloved franchise. First off, know that Criterion (Burnout and Hot Pursuit devs) They did not make this game. This atrocity was made by an entity called Ghost. In a nutshell, this game is complete garbage. Oh Criterion, you are missed already... You're better of sticking in a 10 year old NFS game then play this. Read on.

I could barely get through this hour of play time.  First issue,  almost everything in this game is recycled from NFS Rivals and I wasn't a big fan of that one either but hey if the gameplay is great? Give it a chance right? But no, like others have mentioned, this is nothing but a copy and paste of Rivals.  Yea EA being EA! The B actors they hired are absolutely detestable and you're forced to listen to their tripe and these cut scenes are so bad I want cringe. You will get sick. Grab the barf bags. There's more videos of atrocious cut scenes than you are actually driving the car. Can we leave videos to youtube and not for video games? Even worse, you can't skip it. The fast and furious rendition attempts to  come into play and you'll laugh listening to these idiots, but the worst part, (nope, you can't skip it).

Anyway, when you finally get to drive, you are engulfed with obtrusive text boxes that cover the screen, while you're driving I might add and you have to constantly press B to get rid of it before you crash. After about 15 closures of text books I didn't want to read and constantly being interrupted, the driving finally comes into play. At first glance, I have to say, it's probably the prettiest night time driving I've ever seen.  The cars are purty, very well detailed, and nice cosmetical damage. But...

The good stops there.  The driving itself is borderline bad. The drifting? Um, I'll say this, ""what drifting?"" There is no drifting that I could see or pull out, I felt completely out of control of my ride.  I've felt better handling on Rad Racer for the NES.  And of course, no surprise. No Dash view hurts too, I love seeing the old dashboard in the old NFS games, none of that here. The game is apparently online online ONLY and I of course was having server issues geting into a game too.  Network lag was HORRIBLE and I kept glitching out back to the beginning of a race. I got booted out of a mission right in the middle of the game, and I just had to wait to go back.  Okay, I'm done. Thanks for the beta demo and calling it a complete game.

Just a note. I only played the XBOX One trial but I was originally planning on getting it for ps4, but I assume the ps4 version will be nearly identical."
1001,1,"Well I got the game on launch day and was only able to play for an hour.  3 days Later I was able to play a few hours.  A week later I can play when I want to play.  The server crisis has cleared with more servers.  The problem now is after you hit a population over 40k you will begin seeing some bugs that people playing the beta would never have found as they could only play for an hour at a time before it would make you restart.

So conclusion:  I would wait and see if all of the bugs are fixed. With how things are being patched daily for the server bugs it could be awhile.  I would give it 3 months and it should be up to par for what the game should have been on launch day. Don't get me wrong the game itself has a lot of potential but cant legitimize the buy with all the bugs.  Wait to buy for now, come back later."
1002,1,"Beware you look up the web site to make sure that it has all the ""bugs"" out. NO pun intended. You install the game and when you go to play it a message window pops up and says ""Sorry but debugging in progress."" I am in the middle of trying to get the ""bugs"" out, haha, and play the game."
1003,1,"very bad design.

the sound's volume is always too small.
hardly working at all."
1004,1,"Now that the hype is gone, I'm updating this review. I honestly kind of liked the story, but there are major problems with the gameplay. Remember when you could go into a burgershot, clukin bell or diner? Yeah, that's completely gone now in GTA 5. Remember when you could go to a comedy club? Also gone in this game. There are almost no interactible inside places in this game besides missions. The graphics are fantastic on all platforms, but that does not make it a good game. What I really hated about GTA 5 the most was the missions. You do the same stupid, pointless heists that some are nearly impossible to do, you chase and kill and other things that are just ridiculous for a Grand theft auto game. There was one mission where you have to jump in an airplane and hijack it. I sometimes felt like I was playing a game that was based off a 007 movie rather than GTA. This entire game just felt rushed and horribly streamlined. Should've known something was very wrong when the game was delayed 3 times. GTA 4 was simple and more interactive than this. Almost forgot to mention all of the bugs and glitches that make this game even worse."
1005,1,"One star, because there's no story, no good game play, lack of things to do, the grind is on an insane level. Bungie has no idea on how to make a MMO. Plus 500 million dollar budget on this poor quality game. Its not even fun when you're playing with other people. The only good thing about the game is the music and visuals.

 I did not find this fun because I had experience playing other MMOs. I think a lot of people enjoy this game because its their first MMO, and they don't have anything to compare Destiny to other relate able MMO games. That's completely understandable and hey if you have fun then that's cool.

I recommend this game to people who never played a MMO, who don't care about story, or a serious bungie fan. But if you're like me that craves a good story in games and have experience playing MMOs then this game is not for you."
1006,1,"WARNING: There is NO online multiplayer for this game!

Essentially what you are buying is an updated version of the original game with better graphics - nothing more. The online multiplayer utilizes the ""Halo: Reach"" engine, but includes maps from ""Halo: CE"".

Their excuses for this:

1) ""We didn't want to split up the reach community!""
Bizarre logic. Should we expect that for H4? Sorry guys, no H4 multiplayer - wouldn't want to split up the Reach community! Just imagine if COD used that logic. You buy Modern Warfare 3, only to find out that online multiplayer is Black Ops. What brilliance! Point being, everyone wanted online multiplayer for CE. Even the people that criticize us for being pissed off admit they would of liked to have seen multiplayer for CE.

2) ""We would have had to ship on 2 discs!""
Would you buy a 2 disc game for the ability to play online multiplayer? There's your answer to this excuse.

Answers to people criticizing my review:

1) ""You should have read the box!""
A) It's not a box, it's a case.
B) This is Amazon.com - not Wal-Mart. There is no ""box"" to look at. Nowhere in this page's product description does it say it utilizes the Halo: Reach engine.
C) I didn't buy the game, knowing months before that it didn't include online multiplayer. I created a petition on Change as well as the Waypoint forums to bring multiplayer back. I don't know why you genius's assume because I'm complaining about there not being multiplayer, that apparently means I thought there was. I want multiplayer on the game whether or not I thought it was going to have it or not - duh!
D) Go heckle people walking out of Target and Wal-Mart. Go chill inside of Gamestop and right after someone buys the game you can start yelling ""SHOULDA READ THE BOX, DERRR"". Who does that anyways? Is it common for games that have the xbox live strip, to be a different xbox live game? Besides ODST, this is the only game I know of that utilizes a completely different game's online portion. Do you really expect people to go on a treasure hunt on the back of the box to question what should already be assumed?

2) ""They released this game and you can't be grateful for what you get?""
I'm sorry, I didn't know I was getting this for free. I didn't realize they donated their hundreds of millions of dollars to charity. Wow, you have totally opened my mind, and my heart."
1007,1,"Controller looks official on the page but is incredibly cheap and flimsy. Came out the envelope with faulty D-pad, and the ""analog sticks"" are actually digital octo-gate inputs, meaning they have no variable sensitivity and rather than go 360 degrees they have eight directions they register, period.

Complete waste of money, waste of time, cannot possibly recommend less."

1010,1,"As someone who will be a former Madden 15 owner, I must say there's no real difference between 15 and 17. Sure, you have the usual updated rosters and a slightly modified control system for the running game, but paying $60 for a game that doesn't bring anything new or different to the table? Deplorable.

I've been an EA Sports fan for years, but noticed they were becoming too laid back with the Madden games beginning about six or seven years ago. It used to be EA always offered something new or different with each Madden iteration--along with fixes in the controls--but that's no longer the case. I knew I was in trouble when I looked at the back of the game and noticed that nothing new was highlighted with the game description. I found it funny that their main feature was ""New Dynamic Commentary""! As someone who owned Madden 15, I will say it is new. Listening to Phil Simms got tiring really quickly and anyone else was a welcomed addition. But dynamic? Hardly.

It's incredible that EA has produced exceptional NHL games year after year for close to a decade now. Many of those games are hailed as some of the best sports games ever produced--and that's saying something considering 2K Sports makes great NBA and MLB games. Yet, EA has gotten tremendously lazy with the Madden title. I don't necessarily expect MAJOR changes going from, say, Madden 15 to 16, but I do expect sizable changes between 15 and 17.

But I have to give the game a modicum of credit: The controls are responsive and intuitive. Again, however, that is a carry-over from 15.

In conclusion, it's time someone else produce NFL games. EA has become too lazy with this property and are charging TOO much for the same game, that's nearly the exact same game as two years earlier, and on a previous generation system. Perhaps give 2K Sports the license for a while? Hell, they work their asses off to make each iteration of their sports titles unique from the previous. I would ONLY recommend buying this game if your latest Madden game is, at least, three years old. Even then, you're still paying too much for the game. Buy it used."
1011,1,"I've been fair and gave this game a chance. I thought people were being too harsh on IW. I like the nice graphics, beautiful scenes and characters. This game is like mixing call of duty, star wars battlefront and black ops 3 together. These 3 certainly doesn't mix. The weapons and game play sucks in this game. I never thought call of duty couldn't get any worst than black ops 3. Fighting in space and shooting walking machines with energy laser type weapons is similar to the ones star wars is certainly something that is not desired. There is a reason why the sales are down for this one and for the many bad reviews. I was going to spend the 79 for the legacy to get the remaster but its not worth it unless you like IW too. I think COD should have taken a battlefield 1 approach. I'm glad i rented this instead of spending the whole amount. This game will have a low resell value."
1012,1,"This looked like a regular charger with molded plugs, but when the plug on the game side got stuck in his GameBoy, my son pulled hard, and the whole plug just slipped right off the wire. It's not actually molded, and it's not attached well (I used to do a lot of electronics work; I worked my way through school as an industrial mechanic/electrician). It's a cool design, but this little thing is poop. It died on the second use.

The better and more useful one that I found is the charger listed as 'Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance SP Rapid Home Travel Charger with IC Chip'. The design on the one we received was far superior. The blades on the transformer (the part that goes in the wall power outlet) swivel, so it doesn't block another AC jack. It was much higher quality, and we've had no problems with it. It's only about a dollar more."
1013,1,"Don't waste your time or money. No good games for Kinect, and not many games anyway. I didn't think the Kinect could get worse, from the 360 Kinect, but it sure did. Sadly wiiu is SO much better. Why did Microsoft make it, so you could not use the Kinect from the 360? but then not make any good games, to go with the new Kinect? Motion on either Kinect is horrible. It won't keep up or sync correctly. I have 1 Kinect game, and its on the 360 that isn't bad. Which ever Kinect sports has the golf, is the one I liked. Every other game for Kinect is junk. Please don't waste your time or your hard earned money on this plastic POS! Microsoft should be very ashamed. I am for them."
1014,1,I am a long time fan of this series and I haven't even played RB4 yet-  I hate it for one very simple reason:  when responding to a user's outstanding and detailed review of their product Harmonix responded with pure bulls***.  That tells me everything I need to know and saves me $80.

1018,1,"I Sold mine to a friend for $35.00! It's terrible!
This is a fine example of the greed EA and the gaming industry is headed to.
This game could have been game of the year but instead it was released too early with few maps and many unsolved problems, including uncontrollable snipping, terrible hit detection system, few and small maps and many other issues.
Being a BBC2 fan I was hoping for an improvement with this game and in fact it takes a few steps back in game developing and to my amazement they release a DLC pack only a couple weeks after the unfinished game was released!? WOW! Maybe they should have left that pack in the game and spent some more time smoothing out all the issues it has. It's rough!
You will get very frustrated at the constant sniping and your life span will be only a few seconds all the time. In fact you will spend more time actually waiting for the game to start then in actual combat. Worst letdown ever in a game for me!
I purchased an Xbox 360 slim and a PS3 slim this year with the hope of some great gaming. What I got was low quality games full of errors, rough and obviously rushed to release to increase revenue (Fable 3, Medal of Honor, Fallout NV) I have no problem with them making money, but I demand quality in the product! My only hope now is that COD Black Ops will be more like COD4 then MW2 or I may be done with the video game industry for good!

Don't buy DLC (DownLoadable Content) from companies that release low quality games or games with errors and glitches until the fix them! If you support them buy buying DLC they will continue to release lower and lower quality games and try to sell more and more DLC! Greed has taken over the gaming industry, it's up to us to say no! Next they will try to charge us to play online on top of what you pay Microsoft! All the professional reviewers are being payed! You've been warned!"
1019,1,"Came in horrible condition, fortunately needed the bios only. Not as described tho."
1020,1,"Too Many things the need an * next to them in this game.

*Only 200 cars have cockpit view.  This is a pretty essential thing for a game that claims to be the best ""sim"" game.
*Only 200 cars have the full damage system.
*Only 200 cars can change the wheels on.
*No Logitech Wheel Support
*Online is a mess and its hard to invite friends
*Menus have extreme load times and are not very easy to use
*800 cars are only available through used car dealers and they change every 2 days

There are too many to list here.  I have had this game pre ordered for a couple years.  What a huge let down."
1021,1,"Before I start this review I want to say a few things. I am a LONG time gamer, I have lots of love for all genres especially JRPGs and I am fairly lenient on games. I try to find enjoyment in games that are simply un-enjoyable or have many issues. However I am sorry to say that Fable: The Lost Chapter brings a new definition to the term ""Garbage."" It is simply the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Now I will tell you why:

Story - It blows. It is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable. It is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil. Nothing more, and nothing less. I'm fine with that, but the way the story presents itself is dreadful.

Voice Acting - Atrocious Crap. A 5 year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this. It is unbelievable in every sense of the word. The characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoying.

Music - Nothing memorable at all. I know you don't have Nobuo Uem, or Tsuyoshi Sekito but damn not one good track at all?

Gameplay - It's bad. You will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell. The good/bad system in the game is flawed beyond belief. I know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game FORCES you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible. The entire system is unnecessary if you can't choose.

Technical Issues - Loads of them. There is pop-in, screen tearing, freezing, and many other various glitches in the game. My favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well (The Last Remnant) but at least it had good VA, Story, Gameplay, and AMAZING music.

I know this is coming off as a HUGE rant and I don't mean to offend any of the Fable fans. However I was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them. I am just ashamed that I spent 12 dollars on this and I bought the 2nd one as well which I am just horrified to open.

I'm sorry Peter M, but if your other games are as bad as this one I will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game. If you like WRPGs I would recommend that you borrow this from a friend or rent it first so you don't take a leap of faith like I did.

Rating 1/5 Abysmal"
1022,1,"I haven't been able to actually use the wheel since I don't have any compatible games.  That's where the problem lies.  I heard that the wheel worked with Indy 500 and the Ferrari game.  It does not work with either.  I spent a LOT of time searching for a list of games that work and if that list exists I sure can't find it.  The best list I've found on the net so far is one of the reviews on this page.  There are only about 4 games that work with this and the only one I would be interested in is F1 but that lists for  $104 at the time I wrote this.  Logitech forums have no info on what games work or any useful info for that matter.  Unless you have (or plan to buy) any of the games listed elsewhere in these reviews, I would stay away from this even at this super reduced price.

  If you are buying one of the very few compatible games, this seems to be a very well built item.  It's comfortable on the lap and has a nice force feedback.

  In summary: If you are ok with the fact that this wheel only works with a few games it is a very good buy.  If you aren't buying one of the very few compatible games than I would stay away from this.  The fact that they are not carried on the logitch site basically means that the few games that work with it will be the ONLY games to ever work with it."
1023,1,"this is the same junk EA put out last year. don't be mislead  by 4 star and 5 star reviews. I just finish playing a game. i'll probably be taking this game back to the game store for a refund and put the refund toward Call of duty B3. I wanted to like this game but I could not get pass how it looks and plays like M15 but with a weaker defense  if I was you I would not buy it. just keep playing M14, M15, or go back to M13"
1024,1,"I also have to say my experience with this game has been entirely negative. The problem is not that there are not enough servers, it's that there is no reason for a single player game to require servers at all. You cannot save your games on your own computer. If they put out a new version and close this down, all of your games will be gone. I will continue to rate this at 1 star until they come out with an update to no longer require play on EA's servers. Shame on EA for this crappy game."
1025,1,"I bought this cable to use with my Playstation 2 and my BRAND NEW TV. To make a long story short, I hooked up the Playstation to the Tv using this cable and it doesn't work. Defective product or The technology is behind the Tv's capabilities. at least I only spent $3 on this crap cable."
1026,1,"Every time I try to play this game,I keep crashing into cars and other obstacles. Falling off of your bike is a pain in the neck and running to get back on it,takes forever. The control is terrible and the gameplay is very choppy. There aren't that many locations to race at,and the combat is dull and boring. I wouldn't recommend this game at all. I would recommend buying ""Skitchin"" instead. It's alot more easier and fun,compared to ""Road Rash""."
1027,1,"The game itself is great, graphics, sounds, and concept is just like the TV show.  The major issue I have with it is the fact that it constanly locks up.  I'm running a PIII 733, 512mb Ram, 32 mb Video Card, 16 mb Sound card, and don't have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement.  Due to these technical issues I've encountered with the game, I have not been able to complete it.  It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case.  If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great.  The game is worth 1 star, even if there was an option for no stars, it still is worth 1 the 1 star I gave it."
1028,1,"Really bad multiplayer. most everyone is sniping and camping. The middle of the map is like a wasteland because if you rush you will lose. Its basically 10 campers behind rocks shooting another 10 campers behind other rocks. You die from the weirdest angles because of squad spawn. Im not the greatest FPS player, but there are many other FPS games that I wasn't that great at that I loved. The guns are super weak except the sniper of course which creates campers galore. I'm not a cod fanboy either, i'm not the biggest fan of the latest COD's either. This game is overrated and overrun by elitists who love the game, basically both COD and BF, like republicans and democrats, leave much to desire."
1029,1,"We now have a choice to make as a gaming community. If you want to play and support game makers and let them manage your computer for you. Or not play games. Steam and securerom is nothing more than spyware. Here is yet another game I will not be buying. As easy as it is to get a clean copy of this and crysis add ons, I can not justify stealing, as I can not justify letting game makers control MY computer."
1030,1,I'm convinced that the creators of this game are either scammers or developmentally disabled.  They even get basic things like instant replay camera angles shockingly wrong.  The game mechanics are a joke and always have been.  The entire sports video game industry is a scam built on glitches and stupidity.
1031,1,I love everything about this amiibo. Ganondorf is amazing! But I bought it from France because I refuse to pay a scalper!
1032,1,Not worth the money for this game. The Sims 3 is more like the Sims 1. It is slow and boring. I don't like the idea that there are some parts of the sims that will need to be patched. When Agnes Crumplebotton finally gets the chance to bring her husband back from the dead. He doesn't even get to live with her and in the game he is always leaving. I don't like the idea that you can't switch from family to family just like the sims 2. I am probably done with the sims 3 and probably won't be buying any expansion packs.
1033,1,"Once again, the same issues continue to plague BF series games.
1. Too many cheaters ruin the game.
2. No skill balancing. New players become food for older more experience.
3. Single player game is the only part worth playing."
1034,1,"I'm a single player mode only gamer. I bought this game through Amazon based on trailers I'd seen and a couple of game mag reviews. BUT unlike every other RETAIL purchased game I have that requires a Steam registration to play (as stated on the DVD wrapper), the Homefront publisher goes far beyond this - and no advisement or other statement - where the game installs directly to Steam's game file storage - NOT ON YOUR HD. The only files installed on your computer are the game's Steam related access and security/permissions files. If you use a magnifying glass you'll find buried in the fine print and half obliterated by the DVD wrapper graphics in the lower right corner the statement you are purchasing a subscription to play the game. As such you can't access the .cfg files to halt the intro graphics or other common game .cfg file changes. Point being if you lose your Internet connection you will not be able to play in single player mode even if you have previously selected ""Offline"" mode with Steam because Steam checks to make sure you still want to play offline.

As if this wasn't bad enough, while the game installation was a relatively short under 20 minutes at my 2.6 MBps download speed, when it completed it then automatically began downloading the patch files - 99% for multiplayer - which I didn't want or need. I was never presented an option not to download the updates. So there I sat for an additional nearly 40 minutes for the update download - over twice as long as the game install took.

Once I got to the game itself, I found discrepencies with the stated console ported PC controls - such as the #4 key that is used to target enemy vehicles or other targets for attack - is not listed in the game manual. I eventually found the #4 key by mashing every key in succession. Once I got to where you fly the attack helicopter the stated ascend and descend manual default listed keys didn't work nor when I remapped the keys. Through dumb luck I found out the game was detecting my CH USB joystick elevator control. As such I had to unplug my joystick to gain keyboard key ascend and descent funtion.

Last, the game uses auto save points and even on the lowest difficulty setting all but the those with the fastest twitch reflexes will be repeating the same sequences time and again because of getting taken out by grenades that some how find you taking cover behind a shed or building with no enemy in sight. Bottom line, forget about using stategy or planning your moves or you'll die regularly. The best thing I found is to keep moving and hiding and moving and hiding and moving and hiding to get as close to the next checkpoint position .... and this isn't a sure thing either.

Bottom line, if you're a single mode player and don't mind having a retail purchased game really being a paid subscription to access the installed game files on Steams website, limited installs, screwed up and non-identified console to PC keyboard game controls, auto-save points and a high game play frustration tolerance, then Homefront is for you."
1035,1,"Gun is child size, too small for an average adult to hold like a real rifle without it being really awkward. Because of the size you probably won't shoot it like a rifle, you'll hold it out from your body like a pistol. So it would have been a lot smarter and more realistic to just make the gun a pistol. Sights are useless, only two white plastic bumps. When holding the gun like a rifle I found it to small to use the sights anyway. Gun requires two AA batteries and sensor bar requires two AA batteries. Can't say much else about it because my gun would not connect to the console. The gun has an on/off button on the side just like on a Xbox 360 controller. When I pressed the button on the gun the lights would spin like it was trying to connect with the console but never would. My regular controller had no problems connecting. I guess you could play this game with the regular controller, but the whole reason I bought it was to play it with the gun. Since the gun doesn't work and was a joke anyway, I didn't bother playing it with the controller and decided to return it."
1036,1,"Not that Bethesda designers will ever read this, but maybe players will be warned. On the easiest setting, had a great time, but at the Foundry I had the worst experience I have ever had in gaming. Round and round and round you go getting nowhere fast. Did the designers get a laugh when they made this ridiculous, contrived level? Check the forums. Gamers bitterly complain about this confusing, stupid play. I rarely give up on a game, but the Foundry did it for me. Seeing the YouTube walkthroughs was no help as the level does not lend itself to visual explanation. Same for the text explanations. Drop down and turn left, cross over the catwalk, etc. Drop down from where? Turn left? Are you kidding. The dark corridors all look the same and catwalks are everywhere. I have beaten many games on the most difficult levels, but this is not a game, it's a bad joke. Dear Bethesda, you have received the last dollar I will ever spend on your games. Players beware, this game is a bitter pill when you reach the Foundry. Hope you designers had good chuckle, but you lost my money forever."
1037,1,"I was really looking forward to this game, man what a bummer. Now I know I'm in the minority here but it's my take on this game and here it goes.

Well, so far I've put in at least 6 hours...6 hours of agonizing bordom! I just don't get what all the ""hype"" is about. It's almost as if you have to like this game or you're not ""cool"" by the way people talk about it. Guess I'm not cool, I freakin hate this game.

I actually restarted the game to go ith my lowered my expectations and see if I could bare through it. No go.

The pace is so sllooww[...] My god people, how the hell can you deal with this? I would much rather read a good book than play this, it's far more exciting and stimulating.

The graphics are just so-so, nothing great here. The animations pretty much blow, pretty clunky to say the least. AI isn't the greatest either. And it's so wordy, like I said, if I'm gonna spend hours reading I would rather read a book.

Maybe I'm just spoiled when it comes to RPGs having an uber gaming computer and having played some pretty amazing RPGs.

The break down of this game is as follows.

49% Talking
49% Traveling
2% Action/picking up trash

I'm so glad I got it used, I would really be ticked if I wasted $60 on this.

You've been warned."
1038,1,"wow here i am writing a bad review . i didn't think it possible its ironic that they put this game next to iron aces wich i rated as cardboard aces the graphics are lile crayon drawings . now this one even with this years new computer  , massive memory and top of the line video card . i can not get this game to install . ok if your reading this you must like flight simulators . don't waste your money as i have . the best are still il2 and il 2 sturmovic also il 2 ace expansion pack . those are great flight sims it seems today they spend the marketing on the box and the game does not even load up. trust me go for il2 forgotten battles ace expansion pack .that game does not dissapoint in anyway."
1039,1,"Pre-Ordered this title weeks before it came out. Day it arrived, PSN was already down so I could not activate game on steam. Or play co-op. Or get any DLC.

In other words, I paid full price for the privilege of being ripped off.

So, returning it for the PS3 and getting it for the 360. Thanks Sony."
1040,1,"We bought this game with several others at Christmastime along with a brand new Wii console (so everything is new, nothing is old, everything should work, right?).  Our son loves this game, but it randomly freezes our Wii system.  There is a buzzing noise that travels through the TV speakers, and sometimes the game screen freezes or it just goes black.  The only way to un-freeze the Wii is to unplug it (even the power button on the Wi won't work).

Apparently, from looking at other reviews, this is a problem with this game.  Since it was the most expensive one we bought, it's extra-frustrating that it's the only one that we have had a problem with.

If the game did not freeze (and it does, with absolutely no rhyme or reason-we  can play it for days with no problems, and then, suddenly, it's crashing 3-4 times in a day), we would give this a 5+ stars rating."
1041,1,My steel book case showed up crushed so it won't close.
1042,1,Returned.
1043,1,I bought the first K I for xbox one when I seen this I bought it because the Microsoft said it was all on disc that was a big lie I should have waited for more reviews on it luck I had a friend in town that had high speed internet and that took a hour and a half for 50 gb it wasn't worth hour and a half wait thinking about deleteing it I probably won't buy another Microsoft game because of their cr@p and lies if your thinking about this game get ready it requires u to download u need internet
1044,1,Buggiest game I have ever played.  I want my money back.  Absolute insanity how many crashes and glitches this thing has.  I've had to replay half the missions to get around some stupid map bugs.  HORRIBLE!!
1045,1,"Poor framerate, buggy, boring, and then some."
1046,1,"It's time for gamers to stand up and put a stop to these anti-consumer business practices.  Remember all the backlash with Xbox One, the same thing needs to happen with these publishers who release games utterly lacking in content.  I would rather pay $80 upfront for a game and unlock all the content in-game, rather than deal with day 1 DLC and microtransactions.  I will not support these games under any circumstances."
1047,1,Boring game graphics engine is great but story line is mediocre
1048,1,"Waste of time and $1.99. Should be called a seek and find.  Nothing to solve, no thinking involved."
1049,1,"Worked once, then the battery died. Would not recharge with the PSP charger. Purchased a wall charger just for this product, would not recharge. Stay away from this battery. Very unsatisfied."
1050,1,"Wow. I'm so glad I read these reviews before buying this. Freaking EA man, they don't care about the customer, and it seems they delight in tormenting the player. Draconian? Their system sounds downright Satanic! Poor Will Wright. What could have been a legacy and legend in gaming is destroyed by Corperate stupidity. Heed the warnings of the victims of EA's evil. BOYCOTT THIS CRAP. I've been waiting forever for a game like this and EA killed it before it's time.

BOYCOTT EA! SHUT THEM DOWN NOW BEFORE THEY DESTROY GAMING FOREVER!"
1051,1,"O.K.  I will keep it short and sweet.  I thought the idea of brushing up on my opponents psychological profiles and reading dossiers to plan my missions would be fun.......but in reality, none of this mattered at all in the game.  Here are the problems with the game so you don't have to read a long review.  I am only sharing MY opinion and it may not reflect your own, however, it is difficult to imagine a reasonable person would not find the following issues a bit troubling.

1.  Terrible AI always knows where you are.  You can hide behind walls, use stealth and plan your route.  All to no avail.  They will find you without even seeing you.  The cover system is also broken, with constant problems.

2.  Broken battle mechanics.  You're telling me I spent all this time learning of my foes and hacking computers and alarms to need to shoot a hypersensitive  guard who can run 50 mph IN THE HEAD FOUR TIMES before he is eliminated?  When did they invent bullet proof heads?

3.  The hacking and alarm overrides in the game could be fun, if they were not so hard to complete within a reasonable amount of time.  I have nothing against difficulty, it makes a game challenging.  However in this case, they took it a little too far. Be reasonable.

4.  All of the reading and planning missions, even weapon selection have absolutely no bearing on the game as the developer would lead you to believe.

5.  Most of you are going to want the few hours of time you gave to this game back.  They should pay you to play this game."
1052,1,"What a piece of  ""  ""  this is!  Worst port in the world. An insult to every PC gamer!"
1053,1,Assassins Creed I does not recognize the XBOX 360 usb controller for the PC the game would like you to use. Assassins Creed II does recognize it. I have found on the internet remarks that indicate the company forgot to include the recognition capability in its first version of Assassins Creed for the PC (switch inputs to keyboard and mouse control to play the game). I much prefer playing the game on the PS3 as this game really sucks for the PC.
1054,1,"Don't waste your time on this game! The game may seem like the next horror video game, but it is not anything good. The games third person camera is horrible, the controls are horrible and at sometimes you find your self mashing the same buttons over and over. The puzzles are completely ridiculous and some levels are hard to get through. The save system is stupid because it saves as ""Episodes"" like a tv show. The episodes are split into parts, and if you are on for example part 1, and you don't finish part 1 or you die, you will have to do it all over again. I am trying to stop you guys from buying this game as I have stopped a guy at Gamestop from buying it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1055,1,"Can't say what the game would have been like the one I received wouldn't load , one of the files on the DVD was corrupted and kept crashing the install after 20 minutes ......"
1056,1,"""This poor decision of only one save file per cartridge is only part of what is wrong with this game. It is a series of rushed minigames. No wonder 3rd party games don't sell well on Nintendo platforms when they turn out junk like this. Take my advise and boycott Capcom."""
1057,1,"The B-button on the controller I received only works when you mash it. If it was a C-button or something else, I might not care as much, but the B-button being barely functional is a let-down and definitely doesn't allow you to do special moves in Smash 64 or swing your sword in OoT/Majora's Mask, which sucks. On the bright side, you can pretend that Link is an idiot and doesn't know how to effectively swing a sword. I love walking into dungeons basically unarmed.

TL:DR: if you can manage the cost, buy Nintendo brand controllers and other accessories unless you either know the company is reputable or otherwise you know what you're getting when you buy."
1058,1,This item was used and so dirty >:(
1059,1,"Basically, I think this game is really boring. Yeah it has good graphics, WOOPIDEEDOO! That still doesn't make up for the flaws. The gameplay is ok, but kind of confusing to learn at first. Once you learn the controls you can beat up goofy looking robots, OH BOY! If you like that, guess what, you get to do it the whole first half of the game! Then, you can fight more goofy-looking robots, because that's pretty much all you do. So if you like beating up lots and lots of robots, then this game is right for you, otherwise, I suggest you get as far away from this game as possible."
1060,1,Call of Duty I was fantastic.  Call of Duty II has a poor story line and it;s and the characters in the piece stink.  You can tell that COD was helped by real navy seals.  COD-II was written by Hollywood.
1061,1,"6 months after I purchased it, it won't charge at all. Tried several times and its useless now."
1062,1,I am very good at driving games and started with medium difficulty.  The competition battered me off the driving lines and I just can't see getting into this game even after learning the tracks.
1063,1,This generic cable is unreliable and often does not even charge the brand new 3ds I have.  Stick with nintendo brand or nintendo recognized products.
1064,1,Game would make you not into a man. Don't like games that drag you down.
1065,1,"What is this piece of crap? Terrible cartoonish graphics, horrendous voice acting, especially compared to Chaos Wars, a simple fighting system that'll make you snore, and a boring, unoriginal storyline. Seriosuly, my wet dreams have better stories than this.

For a good PS2 RPG, play Chaos Wars or Final Fantasy X2.

Update: Well, there IS one good thing about this game. Me and Pedobear agree that Anise is nice loli."
1066,1,This game is impossible. Why bother making it if it's impossible. One unit of a certain type could easily wipe oot a whole frickin' army of another! OCH!!!!!!
1067,1,could not get to play
1068,1,It says old model in the title. I ordered expecting the old model aka the one without the light bar on the touch pad and that is not what I got. I got the new model with the light bar. I am very disappointed.
1069,1,"The NFS series has gone downhill since the introduction of NFS Carbon. Gone are the days of beautifully designed circuit tracks (NFS 2, 3, 4, 5), absence of unnecessary cop chases and car tuning.
If you need a game to test your nerves then this is the one. While this game shines in the graphics and sound department, playability is null.

I consider myself a veteran having played games since Doom 1, NFS 1 etc but this game is unplayable. It's no sim mind you but a poorly unbalanced arcade game.
I have not encountered that much challenge in a game unless difficulty was cranked up to hard which I didn't. This on the other hand wouldn't even let me win one race and not because the AI is terribly challenging but because the environment and bad controls make it impossible not to crash. It feels as if your ride gets pulled into incoming traffic like a magnet sometimes appearing like popping up in front of you out of nowhere. Then there's annoying cop chases which IMO are an unnecessary addition to any game that's not called GTA.

This was my last game in the NFS series after other disappointments like Pro Street, Carbon, the original MW and shift."
1070,1,"Okay, I already trade this game in after played for a month. I have 2 move controllers for 2 players mode. You could possibly beat the main Arcade mode in 30 minutes, both Razing Storm and Time Crisis 4. For the rest the game, you will be forced to play the horrible watered-down FPS, Story and Multiplayer Mode. To be honest, if you have ever played FPS games, Battlefield Bad Company 2 or Call of Duty:Modern Warfare 2, this game is a complete garbage. If you go to the Japanese Amazon, this game only has gotten two stars. Even the Japanese customers didn't like what Japanese company made. Whatever happened to the Japanese gaming industry? Everyone plays Monster Hunters 3rd portable on PSP nowadays; they create horrible HORRIBLE console games.

I know I shouldn't compare this game to other popular FPS games since this game is a rail shooter; but, because this game also included both HORRIBLE Story Mode and Multiplayer Mode that's FPS watered-down, I had to compare to the other popular FPS game.

I was a big fan of Time Crisis 2 and Crisis Zone. I probably spent nearly $100 in a period of time at local arcades when I was a kid. Compared to Time Crisis 2, Time Crisis 4 is almost a joke... In addition, Razing Storm is even worse than Time Crisis 4!!!

The only good game in the 3 pack is the Pirates game. Surprisingly, it was the only game that had some quality. I would probably just going to buy the pirates game again if they release it via PSN.

If you are looking for a shooter for the MOVE controllers. I strongly recommend picking up Killzone 3 and MAG! MAG online mode is probably 10X better than this game. Actually, there's no one playing online in Time Crisis Razing Storm, LOL; You could barely find 8 players to start a match. I was ranked on the Leaderboard, ranked 100 after played for 1 day.

This game is a joke consider it's $50. Buy it at your own risk. Wait until the price dropped to $20~$30 dollars."
1071,1,"I bought it at GameStop and let me tell you. It is a disappointment. Is like we had a kind of good game with FIFA 11, then a meh with 12 and 13. Then 14 was AWFUL, but with FIFA 15 I just didn't purchase it from release, until four months ago, it is great and very entertaining. The running and defense gameplay is great.

But you play FIFA 16 and is again worst than FIFA 14 or about the same. No improvement. Don't buy it and save for FIFA 17."
1072,1,"Well, this game did improve a couple things from the first game. Such as the smoke bombs, double hidden blades, and the ability to hire groups to assist you. Other than that, the game is crap. They added a lot more stuff to this game, but none of which is useful or even fun. A lot of missions you do will pretty much require you do it only one way. There are horse race missions...unfortunately the horse controls are still just as clunky as the first one. You will repeatedly jump onto guards when you're just trying to get off a building (real helpful feature *sarcasm*). You get your own town that you can upgrade to get more money...but the only thing you spend money on in the game is weapons, in which, if you never spend money to upgrade your town, you'll have all the money you need to get the weapons you want. Some of those stupid puzzles you do are broken, such as trying to turn the rings to form a picture...but no matter what you do, some rings will turn together and never allow you to complete the picture. I hate the characters. You can literally assassinate 5 guys in a row before you start combat with whoever is left. The maps are busy, so it's hard to tell what's where.
This game also introduced the ability to blend in with crowds to stay hidden from guards. Unfortunately, this feature is broken, and I couldn't even do the introduction mission using that ability. You're suppose to follow the head prostitute around the block by blending in with the crowd and be undetected by the numerous guards. But every single time I tried, the crowd would ALWAYS stray away from her, in which I would either fail by being lead too far away, or I would try to make my way back to her and be caught by a guard. The only way I found to do this mission was to stay close to her while using the rooftops. Really, I tried again and again to do this mission the way they wanted me to, but apparently it is just based off of sheer luck if any crowds manage to go the same direction as her throughout the mission.
I'm sure I missed some stuff, but that's enough of the complaints. The first game concentrated on its strong suits and made you play minimally on its bad parts. Assassin's Creed II does just the opposite. I tried and tried, but the boredom and frustration from this game prevented me from finishing it. Again, almost everything added to the game was useless and stupid."
1073,1,"My bias is that from a Final Fantasy fan.  Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is NOT a Final Fantasy game.  It doesn't even come close to the Legend of Zelda in terms of action/adventure.  It is a waste of time, space, energy, and money.  All together.

I made the regretful mistake of putting this product on my Amazon Wish List when it first came out.  After testing it at stores and reading about it, I quickly realized the game was cheese.  I forgot, however, to remove it from my Wish List.  My brother and sister bought it for me for my birthday one year!  Aye yie yie!

So because of the $50 they scrounged together in my honor, I figured I'd give the game a thorough shot.

I couldn't take it anymore by the time I got to the second level.  It was atrocious.  I felt sorry for the Final Fantasy name and for my relatives for dropping the cash.

Enough of the emotional banter.  Let me try to give an analytical review of this game.

First of all, it does not meet the definition of a classic role-playing game.  (Within the last couple of years, however, I have noticed ""RPG"" taking on a new meaning.  Now it means simply playing as someone else.  Grand Theft Auto, for example, is now classified as an RPG.)  But with today's loose definition of ""RPG,"" you can call it that, I guess.  But I grew up with real RPGs, like Dragon Warrior, the Final Fantasy titles, Lufia, Breath of Fire, etc.  (These were all turn-based RPGs.)

Second, FF:CC does not develop your characters sanely.  Sorry, but whoever programmed this atrocity embarrassed the genre of action/adventure.

Third, I recommend you boycott any GameCube title that requires the use of the Game Boy Advance to play multiplayer.  It is asinine to expect people/kids to pay money for such an inconvenient, expensive, and improper method to simply play with your friends.

Lastly, this game is best suited for gamers who do not like real RPGs but prefer an action game with unique challenges in gameplay.  Yes, FF:CC is an action/adventure, but unlike most others, the gamer will simply have to learn this somewhat different style (it is more hack & slash than anything - the multiplayer functionality should have saved this game from a bad review, but it was disappointing at best).  But other than that, the game will offer essentially ZERO to true RPG gamers, especially those who love the Final Fantasy series.  Stay away from this game if you love Final Fantasy titles."
1074,1,I'm giving this a one star review because who in their right mind sells an electronic device without an AC adapter or wall outlet extension?  The fact that this has to be purchased seperately is a sham.
1075,1,worse game I have ever had.  Mickey Mouse would have been much better.
1076,1,"I enjoy playing these old titles sometimes you find a gem you skipped over, and sometimes you find a turd. This game is a turd.

Remember the earlier days of gaming when the box cover was usually more exciting than the game itself? Well it's pretty much the same thing here.

Hands down the most incredibly difficult game you will probably ever have the opportune chance of playing. Nearly impossible to beat thanks to the games mechanics. You'll at times feel like your trying to take down a tank with a sling shot with the powerless weapon selection they provide you.

The controls aren't that great but they aren't that bad. This is the first time I had to use a cheat code to survive in a game since Duke Nukem... and I mean the original side scroller version. This game is inhumanely difficult. You'll have 2-3 guys attacking you at once. While one is shooting with 100% marksman ship just draining your life away the other(s) will be kicking and punching you and knocking you down. So your getting both beat and shot to death. Sounds like it would be rare but it isn't. This happens 100% of the time when you have one armed and one unarmed opponent mix. Each armed gooned you come across is almost like a mini boss. Your guns will barely phase them while they're guns hit every mark and will kill you even if you jump and run around or try to see cover.

Very poor game mechanics, and pretty inconsistent game play. The music is mundane and the artwork switches from fantastic to what is this supposed to be. Might not matter but in an ""anime"" game what's the reason for having several different artist with multiple renderings of the same character that look different in each one? Sounds like I'm being harsh but I just expected the in game art to look as good as the front cover and the opening scene. Instead it goes from Madhouse to Crayola crayon."
1077,1,"I purchased this after reading reviews of this game and am sorely dissappointed.
The graphics literaly suck and must date back at least eight years. If you are used to such fare as Medal of Honor or Call of Duty, even those that first came out three years ago or more, there is no comparison.
This game would fail to satisfy even if purchased in a clearance bin at 9.95.
Stay away, there are better games out there for less.

The enemy AI even manages to shoot you, while you are hiding behind a building.

The only highlite was the ""Bullet Time"" slow motion, but that is not enough to satisfy even the occational gamer.

Stay away, other games available for less money with a greater fun factor."
1078,1,"Those who say they had it working for a month or so, at least they could use it. Mine didn't work since I plugged it. It didn't work in the X axis and the cursor had movements on it's own.
I don't know if the lens was malfunctioning, but it never showed any light of any kind. This is just a rip off from mad catz. Never buying ANYTHING from them again."
1079,1,"Trust me , it is better on PS4 , It plays better and the online community is better , xbox one is full of kids these days . You have already made a mistake of going with xbox 1 , but atleast save your money on this
thank me later"
1080,1,"My controller failed, in the same way that they have for many others. The left and up on the D-pad failed at the same time as the Square and Triangle buttons failed.

Sony did not bother to replace an obviously failed design version of the early controller, even though it was never dropped, had been exposed to liquid or temperature extremes, and offered no ability to pay for a way to swap it out with a new version.

I highly recommend being wary of this product, if it's an earlier generation model."
1081,1,"I was late to the 3ds party. But this game shouldn't have even came. I wouldn't go as far to sau that is not playable, but it's pretty close"
1082,1,"The title of my review says it all.  At every turn this game was obviously rushed and not polished due to Call of Duty launching on November the 9th.  And no, I'm not a COD fanboy, I just know how the system works.  A huge title that will draw a crowd is a daunting foe in the gaming world.  DICE knew that, and rushed this game to get the maximum amount of sales.

The good about the campaign: The campaign is fun and creative.  The visuals for night vision were impressive and realistic.

The bad about the campaign: The campaign was incredibly short and at times very aggravating.  There were times where someone shouted directions at me and I could not hear them over the gunfire.  Then I'm left wondering if I should move up, flank, follow a comrade, or stay put and defend.  With the lack of good waypoints there are times where you are left confused and frustrated.  Maybe they were going for the realism of warfare?

The good about the multiplayer: I have yet to find one redeeming quality in the multiplayer.  Getting lots of pointless and well designed awards is kinda cool?

The bad about the multiplayer: I will sum up probably 80% of my online experience in this game with two words: Spawn Trap.  This game is so horribly put together for the online gameplay that it makes my head hurt.  All of the maps, with the exception of maybe 2, are so small that you simply need to post up around the other teams spawn to win.  Most of the spawns are in the corner of a map, so you come around a building to mortar fire and sniper bullets.  This means you have 2 choices.  1. Stay put and do nothing but periodically die from mortar and rocket strikes. 2. Attempt to run out in the mass confusion with your other team mates while you get mowed down time after time after time.  The only time I had fun (if you can call it that) and racked up kills was when my team and I returned the favor and spawn trapped the other team.  So you have 2 choices, play like a jerk or get played like a jerk.

Avoid this game, unless you want to rent it and enjoy a fun, fast campaign. Other than that wait for Battlefield Vietnam or Call of Duty if you want a real game."

1084,1,"some of the ubisoft flight sims are wonderful , like il 2 or il2 sturmovic .. this was a bit of a dissapointment , for one , i have  a fairly new dell dimension 3000.  , to play this game i had to spend another 80 upgrading my video card wich was fine .. then my saitek joy stick would not work as it was not supported , so i spent another 50 on the reccommend logitec.. the older flight sims are great simply as you plug in a joystick and can fly .. not so with this game .. you have to try to set each direction as well as down load pathes for the game and joy stick and after all that , does not work .. the graphics are ok and i am sure the game might even be fun . but not worth all the headache , extra expense and still a joy stick that does not let you fly .. ubisoft used to care about what they put out .. but nowadays expensive games , with bugs , patches and games that just do not workk ."
1085,1,"Soul Calibur II is an excellent game, but the Xbox Version, I daresay, is terrible. The special guest, Spawn, is a horrible fighter. Namco could have done better to pick a better guest star for the Xbox.
  The graphics is way better then that off the Virtua Fighters, the Tekkens, and the Bloody Roar Series, but that is the only good part, and thats why it is worth one star."
1086,1,"Had very high hopes for using this corded, and time tested controller in new smash brothers four for Wii U.  Yes it programs commands (I first created two macros for short hopping + instant in air smash as its tricky under fire to pull off).

BE WARNED.  Sadly, the B button on this device - BRAND NEW mind you, is terribly unresponsive and requires really forcing your thumb into what feels like placing a puzzle for the dang button to register. Worse, once you've pressed and are holding down B, the controller doesn't register you holding it down, as it slips around and requires crushing power (following a response delay that cannot be overcome by strength) just to execute any moves than require, uh... B.  I paid as much as a new controller for this, and perhaps note no other issues with any of the buttons - will possibly reconfigure the keys around as in smash having both x and y and the analog pad up serve as a jumping action is a little overkill. Either way, starting from zero this is a letdown of a purchase and my gut tells me no matter how I try to work around it's design flaws this controller won't last very long given poor functionality mint out of the box."
1087,1,to put it nicely A PIECE OF JUNK
1088,1,"The title of my review says it all.  Don't waste your money.  I bought this game and after trying it for a dozen or so times, ended up putting it in my case and forgetting about it.  Very disappointed in it."
1089,1,"No, it wasn't.  I remember being very excited when Driver 1 was supposed to come out.  You were supposed to be a gangster, running from the law, a game built oin the same engine (same physics) as the destruction derby games.
BUT, whoever made Driver 1 thought it way too controversial to make a villian as the lead, so they decided to make it an ""on the run"" police officer.  that was weak and i lost interest in it, don't care how great the game was.  do i want a watered down version of an artist's vision?  please, why don't you put that fig leaf on ""David""'s unit in Florence.
So, here we go, now we have driv3r, a couple years after the GTA wave breaks.  yay!  in driv3r they finally let you get out of the car and do foot missions, fight, shoot, run over people, now that the coast is clear.  there is nothing innovative about what they are trying to do here.  driv3r is not the original.  any company that forfeits it's edginess to be politically correct will not get my money.  might as well have tipper gore in the passenger seat the whole time, telling tanner what he could and could not do."

1091,1,"I have owned every Harvest moon game starting from the n64 one.
This one just sucks there are 2 towns you they r figthing over who has the best food each season.

Well the story sounds okay for a harvest moon game but it takes out everything I loved about the other harvest moon games.

There is no mining
the kids don't grow up at all
You don't have too build your farm up
all you really do it this one is cook.
I miss the old harvest moon games I wish they would make one for the 3ds thats just like the wii versions"
1092,1,"I loved the Tom Clancy series. Couldn't wait to open this up. Where the heck is the single player campaign mode?  I''m not a big fan of multiplayer. I was looking forward to a campaign, COD style. What I got for single player is cheezy 'situations' where you get points. Seems like Ubisoft took the lazy way out on this one. Even the first cut scene is short and lame.

Aiming is a challenge  too. Almost  impossible to get a head shot. So disappointed. This game is going back where it came from.

I noticed the new Star Wars game omitted the campaign mode as well. Not sure if this is the direction game makers are going. If it is, count me out. So now, I'm going to have to really research each game to see if it's really a game at all or just salad dressing for slow servers.

Not sure why so many are comparing this to Call of Duty. I just played Advance Warfare and it's a masterpiece compared to Siege. One of the best, most engaging campaigns I've ever played. COD rocks."
1093,1,"didn't like it - was expecting something more like the Pacman that came out for playstation 1, but this is disappointing. They just don't make pacman/sonic games like they used to..."

1097,1,"The controller arrived with the wires wrapped around it and it was filthy, like it came out of a yard sale. When tested, the controller didn't work."
1098,1,"this has got to be one of the worst wii games i ever played, even worse than trauma center. where do i start?
for one its hard to control despite how simple the controls are, some of the challenges in the beginning of the game are nearly impossible to beat and the rating system. i thought it would be fair if the performance rating would average each rating such as turning and speed together, but no thats not the case, it takes the lowest grade and makes it the final grade, so if i got an A grade in everything and a D in turning, my overall grade would be a d. another thing, you are rated on how much you turn, which makes no sense because theres no reason to turn excessively  on courses where you are going straight down, or courses that require little turning, you should only turn as much as you need to. i have had it with this game.
how is this game so easy yet so hard, well when one of the training courses kept failing me cause i did not turn enough despite me turning the entire time. it was relatively easy to control cause i was getting used to the balance board, but it was failing me even though i did it right.

it is not all bad, i kind of like how when im playing the game at night time i have the option to choose to play the game in the night time setting, but thats not saying much.

i am usually the one not to complain about video game graphics, but these are just so bad, in some cases the graphics can get worse than the n64, like when people talk.

another problem i have with this game is the lack of wii remote usages, all you to is push down to speed up and wiggle your arms in mid air do do a random airborne trick. i was not expecting much out of we ski, but i did not know it would be this horrible."

1105,1,"I live in China but it's not my mother tongue. All I want to do is play Starcraft II on the local Chinese servers in English. This was possible in Starcraft: Brood War, released in 1998. In fact, playing on any server in any available language was possible. But Activision-Blizzard does not allow cross-region play for Starcraft II. They don't even let you play on a LAN with your friends, which means some amount of lag is always going to be present, even if you're right next to your opponent. All of this was doable 12 years ago. Activision-Blizzard has never satisfactorily explained why these features have not been implemented in Starcraft II.

The end result is that the community has been balkanized based on country and language. And if you happen to live in a region that doesn't support your language, or want to play someone from another country or region, well, tough luck. This game is not for you."
1106,1,"Seller claimed in description that game was in working condition. When it arrived, it was RATTLING. Needless to say, it wouldn't play. Which is pretty bad considering how tough these things are. It'd be nice to get a replacement without getting charged shipping for a product with a false description."
1107,1,"Didn't really get much fun out of this game, based on 3 hours into it, there is still no ""game"" to play. There are cutscenes after cutscenes (in game graphix, no video), you spend the majority of the time you do get to use your character sneaking from point ""a"" to ""b"", and maybe you get to kill a vampire on the way. And the vampires? One hit your dead. One hit throws you into the air (there has been no counter or dodge as far as I can tell) the second hit finishes you off. 3 hours and I think I've come across 5 vampires. Very very weak game. Just save your cash and look for something else."
1108,1,"Wow, I don't know what to say. I originally gave this thing a 5 star rating, but somehow overlooked a glaring problem with it. The mouse is inaccurate, laughably so. To drag the mouse from right to left in a somewhat straight line, is nearly impossible, the mouse randomly jerks and twitches. I don't know if this is an outdated software issue (The company was merged with another company so I couldn't find any software support that helped) or the mouse being poorly made, either way It started out annoying, became unusable, avoid this mouse."
1109,1,"With the exception of Budokai, Dragon Ball Z games often fare poorly. DBZ: Taiketsu, sadly, joins their dismal ranks. If nothing else, Taiketsu succeeds somewhat in capturing the simple visual charm of the show. The large characters look clear and visible on the tiny GBA screen, but overall they can't compete with the superior graphics of GBA champions MK:DA and Street Fighter, and Taiketsu's herky-jerky animation is also particularly distracting. To save battery juice, go ahead and mute the muffled background music and scratchy sound effects-since the game lacks character voices, you won't miss anything important. Taiketsu's button-mashing gameplay is shallow and simplistic, even for a kid's fighting title. There are 15 characters total, including favorites from both the series (like Cell and Goku) and the movies (including the popular Brolly). Aside from the occasional super-move, each character boasts only a meager handful of attacks and combos. Worse, there's very little difference between the various fighters. Players can also occasionally take to the skies during combat, but that gimmick burns out quickly. On the plus side, the game thoughtfully includes several play modes (like Tournament and Endurance) to help extend the replay value; unfortunately, none of the game types are interesting or particularly enjoyable. Another nice touch is the Soul Calibur-esque secret system, which allows players to earn Z Points to unlock bonus modes, settings, and pictures. Overall, unless you're an eight-year-old DBZ fanatic, you'll find that this Saiyan is hardly super."
1110,1,"I just feel the need to get here and drop this warning, DON'T BUY without play the DEMO, I just grab demo from PSN store and this game IS SO BAD I don't have words for it, except it have some pretty graphics, that's all, game ends there, on graphics.

Incredible how SEGA, supposing they spent some million to develop a game and this is the final result !?!?!? Where's the quality ? And gameplay ? Did anyone of the testers (if SEGA as any) liked this gameplay or even play it ??

Shame, many will end buying this game without previous warning. DON'T BUY IT."
1111,1,"I was a HUGE fan of the first couple Tenchu games on Playstation. Then they just kept on tossing out cheap ports packaged as ""new games"". No innovation, no updating the experience, just the same old stuff with slightly new level maps. Now, with the Xbox 360, they have released YAT ANOTHER cheap port of the same old game. The graphics are awful for a 360 game, the controls are clunky and slow, the level maps are ridiculously lame looking and un-detailed, the bad guys are just as stupid and dense as they were on the Playstation 1. I wish people would stop buying these games so that the developer would be forced to take a hard look at the franchise and either stop making it or properly update it and make a good game. The first couple were so fun and tense, real white knuckle gaming. Then it just got boring. Not taking advantage of the potential on the 360 is just stupid and I feel sorry for people who basically threw away $60 on a game that is not worth $10."
1112,1,The game is not cool it is not callngin like the odd parnts game bay that.
1113,1,"Thought I'd try this again after a few months - it's actually gotten worse.  Hardly anyone plays online, and those that do are clans.  So, if you're playing solo, expect to have a horrible experience.  If you can get into a match at all.  Matchmaking can sometimes take longer than playing the actual match.  Even playing against bots (wargame), you will wait and wait and wait for enough players to join.  And all the terrible game mechanics are still there; spawning in front of enemy bullets, getting killed 6 feet around corners, lag, frame drops, glitches, host migrations... the list goes on and on.  This game truly deserves zero stars.

FINAL ANALYSIS: It's boring, frustrating, and oftentimes maddening.  Activision insults us by forcing these horrible maps on us with the release and then tries to sell us the 'good' maps in a DLC.  And now these new weapons (Maverick and Ripper) feel like pay to win.  Maybe they'll sell perks like ""no-host-disadvantage"", ""frag-the-lag"", ""shoot-first-kill-first!"", and ""dedicated-servers-for-dedicated-players"".  I'm being only half-sarcastic; I really can see this happening, especially with the cast of clowns at Activision.  COD is dead to me now and forever.  Time to move on!

UPDATE2: Not only do they keep pushing the cruddy maps (Free Fall has been made universal, so it's coming up MUCH more often), but I seem to be getting host a lot now.  What happened to dedicated servers?!  The game has gotten so bad I'm only playing Squads now.  But even playing against bots is frustrating - they camp just as hard, but they have built-in aimbot and they appear to see through walls.  IW must really want us to buy the DLC for those small and medium maps as they keep pushing the large ones.  Well, no thanks - I'm speaking with my wallet and refusing to buy anymore from IW.  I'm going back to BLOPS2, along with thousands of others.  As of this morning, there were only 40K playing.  Dropping my star rating from 2 to 1.  It's that bad now.

UPDATE1: I don't know what Activision is doing, but they seem intent on pushing every one of their bad maps at me, over, and over, and over again.  Siege, Sovereign, Stonehaven, Chasm - it's a never ending repeat cycle. And there are so few players on - just today, it was 45K.  Worldwide.  So, finding a match without a large ping is hard to come by.  And it shows.  This game is absolutely no fun.  I'm dropping it from 3 to 2.

The graphics ARE better in the single and multiplayer modes.  However, in MP mode, I do find the extra shading and lighting effects to be distracting and makes it even harder to see the enemy - dark corner McDougal's are even darker!  And the beams of lights blind you - almost as bad as a flash bang.  More deaths that can be attributable to map design, yay.

I do notice much less stuttering/lost frames, thanks to the power of the PS4.  But lag compensation will always be with us.  Still too many deaths from invisible enemies.  At least the game is appropriately named - I often feel like I'm shooting at ghosts (bullets don't seem to hit at all) or being shot at by ghosts - bullets hitting me out of thin air.

So, this game is just slightly better in the PS4 version.  Is it worth the $10 upgrade if you have the PS3 version?  Sure, why not.  But it's still only a 3/5."

1115,1,"PRO
- good sound quality
- comfortable

NEUTRAL
- not really completely wireless. this is more likely MS's fault than anyone else. if they're not going to figure out Bluetooth then they need to figure out a no latency wireless protocol or other tech to get rid of ALL the damn wires. They get tangled up when you store them away and it's REALLY annoying. The additional adapter that plugs into the bottom of the controller is additionally annoying. It's 2015, figure it out.
- no feedback/monitoring (you can't hear yourself). MS's own headset also has this problem. Again, it's 2015. What the hell is this about? You'll be yelling to hear yourself. People that are hard-of-hearing do this. It's annoying to you and you'll be annoying to other people so that's doubly annoying.
- the color scheme / style doesn't really feel like it matches that of the Xbox. The black might pass, be the other colors don't make any sense. The green stripe in the white set doesn't match any Xbox green in their color scheme...like some jackass in marketing just said ""what color should we make it?"" and some other idiot said ""green....those xbox jerks like green."" ""what type of green?"" ""bah, doesn't matter...let's just shove it out the door."" I guess this is nitpicky but I'm not sure why? not many after-market brands out there seem to be able to figure out these very difficult concepts like color and paint.

CON
- firmware was necessary just to get things working somewhat (didn't fix the mic problem however). for a  $100+ set, this seem rather lousy.
- The mic is not near your mouth so it would need to be EXTRA sensitive. It isn't. They screwed this up so bad they had to release an extra attachment to get it to work properly. I registered 2 of these headsets at polk.com, but over a month later, nothing arrived. I had to call to get them to send something and they still haven't. It would help if they would show a picture of this boom mic thing so I could see what it looks like and try to conceive of how it might help (or be yet another additional problem). Since the original mic is designed to be retractable, I assume this boom attachment will stick out and render the retractibility useless.
- Separately from the mic's insensitivity is the pressure required to get it to retract or release. I nearly sent my first set back because I had to press down so hard to get it to stick (retract inside) I thought I might break it. I thought it was broken because it wouldn't stick. A 2nd set also had this problem.
- For whatever reason, the mic didn't initially seem to work at all on either set. Flat out no response. Then after retracting and multiple times it magically worked. Will it stop working at some point? Is the connection loose? It's really hard to have faith in this product.

I tested this set with what everyone uses: Call of Duty, regular Xbox chat, Titanfall, Halo, etc...

NOTE
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU READ IN OTHER REVIEWS OR THE Q&A, NEITHER OF MY 2 HEADSETS CAME WITH THE BOOM MIC. BOTH WERE IMMEDIATELY REGISTERED WITH POLK BUT I HAD TO CALL THEM TO GET THEM TO SEND AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO AUTOMATICALLY SEND IT TO YOU. POLK REQUESTS/REQUIRES PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS WHEN YOU REGISTER. WHY PHONE NUMBER? THAT'S EXCESSIVE. THERE WAS NO ""THANKS FOR REGISTERING YOUR POLK PRODUCT"" VERIFICATION EMAIL, SO THAT SEEMED POINTLESS. WILL I NOW RECEIVE PHONE OR EMAIL SPAM? WHO KNOWS...

POLK
I own several Polk speakers and they're solidly built and work reasonably well especially considering the price. They should not have rushed this product out the door. They clearly didn't test it well enough and they obviously don't have enough (or any) experience in multiplayer gaming audio. This headset fiasco kind of tarnishes their brand just a little...Stick with Turtle Beach, Astro, the brands that have some experience and proven track records...Polk's first foot forward into gaming is a stumble...

Skip this headset. Too many problems. Too much rigmarole to deal with considering the $100+ price tag...Can't even tell you whether the boom makes anything better over a month later because I still don't have it...That's silly considering the return window to Amazon would already be closed for my 1st set..."

1119,1,i can't believe people gave this game 5 stars.oh wait yes i can.people today give crappy movies and games 5 stars.this game tries to be cool by throwing in lots of curse words in the cut off scenes.nothing new here in the fighting style.same as most games.and i can't stand the japanese animation look.
1120,1,"Terrible graphics, choppy frame rate, and uninspiring story....extremely dissapointed"
1121,1,"My Son and I play Final Fantasy XI on various systems (PC, Workstations, Playstation 2, and Playstation 3).  My primary access is a Dell Precision 390 workstation using this controller.  I also use the same controller on a Dell Laptop (Inspiron 9300).  This is a GREAT controller when it works, but thus far they die quickly.  Over the years I bought 5 of them and thus far only 2 of them are working.

When I contacted Logitech for support, they turned me down because Amazon.com won't provide warranty support unless you have a paper receipt.  The only receipt I have when buying from Amazon.com is what I show on my screen.  I did a copy and paste and even turned it into a PDF file (for printing), but the Logitech employee said it could be a fake.

When I contacted Amazon.com about getting a paper receipt, the first person said she'd send me a new controller.  When it didn't arrive, I called and another person said the first person exceed her authority, as it broke after the 30th day (or maybe it was the 2 week mark).  So, I'm stuck with a controller no one will fix even though it died during the warranty period.

As for the other two dead controller, they died somewhere between the 14th and 18th month.  I didn't even try to get them fixed, exchanged, or my money back.

I don't know of a better controller when it is work, which is why I keep coming back.  I hope people out there have some suggestions.  I also hope someone from Logitech reads this and has a solution for Amazon.com customers!!  Logitech should honor their warranty even if we buy through Amazon.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1122,1,Worst Legend of Zelda game I have ever played. How can this abomination be considered canon but Hyrule Warriors isn't?
1123,1,"Here has been my experience with this game so far:

1. Pre-ordered the game and got a $20 coupon for Origin, but they never told you that you can only spend that coupon on a limited number of games and had to spend $30 total on the order. Then they price games at .99 so you can't hit exactly $30 and have to spend at least $40.

2. The servers were constantly going down and I was constantly getting ""Unable to connect, please try again"".

3. The tutorial would constantly reset so when I could finally connect to the servers, I would have to do the tutorial all over again before playing the main game.

4. When finally entering a main game, I would build a few roads and then the game would crash to the desktop.

5. EA told me over the phone that they won't give me a refund, and if I try to seek a refund in any other way they will ban my account from Origin. That means I wouldn't be able to play ANY of my Origin games and would have to either buy them all over again or never use Origin again. It would be the latter.

I plan to never buy an EA game again, which really sucks because a lot of good game studios are under the EA banner, but it just isn't worth this aggravation anymore..."
1124,1,"If you buy EA products you support this always online  requirement garbage.

You should want to be online when YOU want to be online and off when YOU want.  A GAME should NOT dictate that.

Sorry EA, but I am not taking part in this nonsense."
1125,1,not that great of a game...
1126,1,"First the pros.  The graphics and sound are great.

Now the cons.  It's buggy as hell.  The single-player is basically a glorified training campaign.  The weapons are ridiculously unbalanced.  There are few maps.  The new operations mode is stupidly short.  The whole game is about as arcade as it gets.  It's a shame really.  To build such realistic looking scenery, then have a bunch of 12 year old jackards running around like cokehead supermen is just a joke.  I don't know why I was expecting something else.  No joystick support on PC?  WHAT?  That is unforgivable.

I wrote a much longer review, but deleted it as I wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not happy that I spent my money on this.  I know the initial reviews of this game were glowing, but I think once people get past the high production value, they'll see a thin and inconsistent game with debilitating bugs and balancing issues.  I may revisit it after they've had months to work out the issues, but there are too many issues right now to warrant much time spent playing this game.

Wait for it to go on super sale like the rest of the Battlefield series.  It'll be less than 50% the cost within 6 months."
1127,1,"I have played plenty of remastered games so was prepared to deal with sub par graphics but this was so ugly I could not play it. Less than ps3 standards, easily a ps2 level look. Blocky textures and awful character animation. The camera at the first boss fight finally did it in for me. They should have left this one where it was on a handheld. I am sure the story was great but to unpolished for me to bear. Would recommend for completists only."
1128,1,"Would of been a four star review but 2k closed their servers deleting all of your SINGLE player save data, definitely never buying a 2k sports game again if they don't fix this."
1129,1,"I read a lot of reviews on FF X-2, and though I love FF games, well lets say X-2 sucked and bad, and I am a female, and I though this game is not interesting. I gave the game back to game stop. FF X is a great game, but I don't know what happened in FF X-2.

There are a lot of stupid side quest, which I could not stand. It drove me nuts.

The game characters looked really weird in my opinion.

I didn't think the graphics were all the great, ok I guess, and the story line sucked. I did not enjoy the battle system.

I would highly recommend renting FF X-2, before you buy this game."
1130,1,the game cheats and is unfair i shot a bad guy 3 times and he is still standind whenever you fight a gang they shoot you in the back while your punching the other  bad guy that not fair why does everything on playstation have to be as hard as possible
1131,1,"Resident Evil use to be my favorite franchise, unfortunately its gone down hill, and I don't think the developers have any plans to return Resident Evil to its roots. They have made a COD/zombie. If I wanted a first person shooter full of action I would have just waited for black ops 2."
1132,1,I chose this rating because it's the lowest I can give it. IT  is not nowhere near micro soft air combat I bought years ago. I would have expected better in 2013.

1134,1,"Have spent dozens, maybe hundreds of hours, dealing with the myriad problems I've dealt with this machine since 1 month in, when I got the dreaded but all too common red lights of death and had to send it into Microsoft.  I'll just list all the problems:

1) Red lights of death a month into ownership, after not having so much as scratched it and with moderate use.  Talked to Microsoft then had to send it into them.  Took 2 months for them to send me a refurb replacement.

2) from the moment I got the replacement, my game discs would not load correctly one third of the time, for which I have to eject disc, manually reposition, then re-insert.

3) Halo 3 map pack which I purchased separately not loading, except for one day (7 on the 7th for those who played Halo 3) of the month.  After hours of trying to figure out problem on the phone with MS reps, no resolution.

4) Xbox controller sticky analog shift only 6 months in, still no fix

5) Windows media player unable to sync

6) Not all codecs for Video Player downloading

7) Netflix requiring you to manually input your username and password each time you log in because I used a different Netflix account to log in initially (this only happens on the Xbox). Extermely annoying.

8) LOUD fan.  So loud I finally had to put it behind my bureau and cover/surround it with blankets,pillows just so the noise which is still loud is bearable.  Then it overheats and I get one red light of death (only one Microsoft?)

Each of these problems required scouring the Internet for possible solutions, talking to MS reps on phone, then physically attempting to fix the problem if applicable.  MS reps are completely oblivious, takes at least half an hour to wait and have to explain the problem before they even understand what the problem is.  In addition, when my Xbox Live subscription expired they attempted to do a bait and switch by first offering me 1 month for $1 and then another year for $20 on phone, I learned later it was $30 and they of course had no record of the conversation and talked as though *i* was the one who tried to ip them off.  No joke.

I've given up playing games and at this point I just wanted something to watch videos and video apps on my TV. Because of above problems, I can't.

I will have to buy a PS3 very soon.

For not only the money but of equal importance the time, energy and stress i spent on the myriad problems, i strongly recommend against buying it, as 54% - yes, more than half - of all Xboxes malfunction.  And that's not counting the smaller problems like map packs not loading or Netflix requiring you to log on each time that will cause you endless hassle.

I will never buy an Xbox again, whether this generation or the next.

Have only owned this machine for over a year and that's"
1135,1,"I wasn't too sure how comfortable these would be, until I tried them on, but they were great, Unfortunately, they stopped working after just a couple of days. No idea why. A shame, because the sound both ways was great on Skype."
1136,1,"Promises, promises, this game offers little of what is advertised.

  The main let down is the control, choppy at best, leaving you out more money that you could
  have used for a much better game , or paid you light bill.

  Even the tutorials do not work correctly,( a RED FLAG of whats to come).

  All in all, it must have been rushed into production before the bugs were worked out, and
  the patch does not help."
1137,1,"if you're expecting a game like prince of persia: sands of time that's a puzzle-solving sort of game, look elsewhere!  this game starts you right in the middle of combat.  that wouldn't be a problem.. if the combat was fun.  unfortunately, it's not.  the controls don't feel good and it's not intuitive.  2 minutes into the game, you're fighting a boss.  absolutely ridiculous.  it seems they tried to put graphics over gameplay for this game.  if you want a fighting game, just play something like devil may cry or ninja gaiden, not this."
1138,1,It said closed the same day I got it.
1139,1,Just forget it.
1140,1,"Disclaimer: I purchased this game off the Playstation Store , not Amazon, so it will not show I purchased here.  This was an impulse buy on my part and it was a horrible decision.  This game is not worth $60.  The graphics aren't bad and its one of those situations where I know there is potential here .. it's just road-blocked by clunky gameplay.  The killing blow for me however was when I went into the Online store for the game.  You ever get that feeling like you want to buy something but you know you are just being fleeced?  This is that in it's truest sense.  I am ashamed of myself for shelling out $60 for this greedy, clunky, half finished mess and, in essence, promoting this kind of behavior by developers/publishers.  Save the money or buy Dragon Age Inquisition, Shadow of Mordor, Farcry 4, or many of the other quality titles that are out there right now."
1141,1,"I guess that the game is pretty fun to play, but the graphics are the worst thing I have ever seen! I think the makers should be ashamed of even thinking of making this a GBA game! This could easily be a GBC game! I can not reccomend this game at all."

I have a expensive gaming system!!!  Even on the Intel it sucks!!!  Total rip off.  F-U steam!!!  You also need the internet to install, run and too get ripped off!!!  Nothing works right!!!  The story line is loooooonnnnnnggggggggggg, boring and repetitive!!!  I have never, ever hated a game so much!!!  Curse you @#@#!!! Im stuck with this piece of crap!!!  I can't sell it, cuz i know it would kill my positive reviews!!!"
1144,1,Did not come in original box and did not work for a second. Tried it on 4 different controllers on 3 different xbox 360's did not power on none. I'm sure if u find one original new unopened it will be great but that is not what you are buying here
1145,1,"Tiger Woods All Play for the Wii is a major disappointment! As many others have mentioned, the putting is simply AWFUL! It's unplayable in Career Mode. The short game, chips, bunkers, etc. are also terrible. Teeing off, and longer iron shots are great. The scenery is great. This game could be, and should be, great- but it's not. The Wii should be perfect for a golf game. Overall, I've been disappointed in the Wii as a whole. The best game so far is Wii Sports that comes with the console. That's pretty sad.
Back to PC gaming for me."
1146,1,Works as well as the broken battery it was supposed to replace. Can't hold a charge and ended up throwing it away.
1147,1,"Was good while it lasted, but after about three or four months of use it just gave up the ghost and stopped working altogether. No idea why, but we tossed it and purchased a different charger. Wish it had a longer life."
1148,1,You literally can not play this game because the developer can not keep the servers up.  The game has NO offline mode which makes the product completely worthless for the time being.
1149,1,Piece of junk. Bought brand New. Error Code from the box E203. Solutions on Xbox.com/support - Useless. What this Microsoft made ?
1150,1,"First of all I played this game from classic until Firelands raid, which was released in Cataclysm. I wish I had quit sooner, but kept hoping they would release content that was fun again. It is worth noting I have done quite a bit of progression raiding, had 11 level 85 characters, and had most achievements completed on my main as well when I stopped playing.

You pay for the game, the expansions, and basically pay them for the full cost an expansion again every 3 months of subscription fees. And then they do things like leave intentionally low population servers open so if you can't find a decent guild on your server it is another $25 (per character, so if you have alts you want to bring it is more) to transfer servers which doesn't actually cost Blizzard anything... This game is completely designed around bleeding the money out of your pocket.

Once you are max level the game wastes as much of your time as possible on repetitive tasks such as daily quests, daily instances, farming materials, achievements that require grinding rather than skill, etc. Raiding requires either a lot of materials or a lot of gold. One great addition was cauldrons to reduce the need for farming once your guild level was high enough to give it more uses and whatnot, but they do still take a lot of materials.

The daily quests and instances (I think the instances are weekly now, but require you to do an average of 1 per day) are also somewhat necessary for progression raiding for quite awhile after content releases because of the rewards they give. Running the exact same instances that you have cleared countless times with a random group every week is not only mind numbingly boring and time consuming, but you also get stuck with either horrible players, jerks that que'd together with the intention of screwing everyone else over, or a group that already kicked someone and has afk members. (If you leave you get a half hour debuff, if you don't you can't get rid of the afk people.)

Finally there is raiding. This used to be what made WoW a great game. I remember in classic killing a new boss was actually an accomplishment. Raids had 20-40 people in them which made the fights much more complex, but fun. The content itself was also much more difficult and more fun. After classic they switched to a 10/25 man raid format. Since Cataclysm they made the gear in 10 man exactly the same as 25 with easier bosses in 10. They also took the lazy way in instance design by making the higher end raids heroic modes of the same exact instance and bosses. Most good guilds beat normal content within a week of it's release... meaning the rest of the time until next content release is just repeating the same content on a higher difficulty. To me that is very boring and just lazy on Blizzard's part. Even the gear models stay the same, all the items look the same on higher difficulties but have higher stats. They used to release multiple raid instances and once you beat one you would move on to the more difficult one instead of just repeating the same thing."
1151,1,"Get the travel case, instead, it really doesn't protect it that much, althoug it is confy for handling, more confy than the travel case.

1152,1,"THIS PARTICULAR ADAPTER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE LATEST XBOX 360 SLIM VERSION!

1153,1,"Let me start off by saying that back in the day of the Super Nintendo, I did own Gradius 3 and had an absolute blast with it. The game's graphics, music and gameplay were standout gorgeous, I loved it. Granted, I have never played Gradius 4 but figured it would be just as good if not better than the G3 that I remember from back in the day. The versions on this PS2 console are an embarrassment to the PS2's capability. Granted, even though this game was released somewhat early in the PS2's era, I simply can't believe that a system that can play games like Resident Evil 4 and God of War I and II could put out something this hacked.

Now, before I say anything let me just say that the G3 on this disc is NOT THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION! So if you are like me and wanted to play that game again, you can forget it. Dont pay any attention to all these ridiculous positice 5-star reviews on this site. I have no idea what kind of drugs these other gamers are on or  they probably work for Konami directly.
This is SUPPOSED to be a straight arcade port, but I can't imagine the arcade version looking and playing this terribly... and I was right! I went as far as to check Youtube videos of both the SNES and arcade versions and they BOTH look significantly better than this game. So judging from that, this game isn't even a straight arcade port of G3... so what version is this exactly??? I have no idea. Seems like some extremely poor rushed port of the arcade version that plays more like an emulated game with extremely pixaleted graphics that look as if they belong on the original NES. Things are just too uneven, the objects are too big and the ships and enemies have probably like 2 or 3 colors at most. Overall, it looks terrible. I was shocked because after the really cheap looking presentation I was afraid that my worst fear was true, that this was not the SNES version. For that game, it seems that Konami made it a point to overhaul the gameplay and graphics when bringing the original arcade version home to make it more ""home friendly"", and they did an absolutely excellent job of doing so. G3 for the SNES game looked and played about 3X better than the original arcade version. I'm not sure why Konami, being the same company that brought the SNES version knowing FULL WELL it was superior to the arcade, decided instead bring the more substandard arcade version to the PS2 instead of their SNES classic. Not to also mention that the PS2 has about 3 or 4 times the graphical horsepower that the SNES had! It's like, are you kidding me??? Again, it was a rush job and an absolute embarrassment to them. Shame on Konami for not having the common sense to AT THE VERY LEAST just port the SNES version over. If you ask me, this should've been an overhauled and updated version of the SNES version! Who even cares about the arcade version of G3??? I wish I can say some redeeming things about the game, but if the game isn't even ARCADE perfect, what's the point? This is just an humiliating rush job that was just put out to meet demand. Even the voice acting prompts in the game that state what power up you use sound severely weak. Konami decided to forgo the cheesy sounding ""kill/destroy them all!"" and ""You need more practice"" bits out of the SNES versions, and on here they just sound annoying and stupid and completely unfitting to the game's atmosphere.
Now considering Gradius 4, there isn't much difference. The G4 version on this disc does look and play a BIT better than the G3 version. But from my memory G4 wasn't brought home on any console, so we really only have the arcade version to go by. Whether this is an ACTUAL arcade port of the game I'm not really sure because I didn't bother researching G4 on Youtube or anywhere else to make a comparison. Granted, even so, the game does move a BIT faster and gameplay is a bit smoother and there isn't that disgusting pixelated look to the game, but overall G4 is just a small step better than G3. I feel no real desire to return to either game, and would much rather just buy a used copy of G3 for the SNES instead. To add insult to injury, the games don't even have a continue feature with them. Nope, you basically have to beat these games in a single sitting with your measly 3 lives (and 5 if you change it on the options menu), and considering how badly these games play, don't even bother putting it on anything harder than ""Very Easy"" mode. You won't get anywhere.

Save your money, and if you're a Gradius fan, I would suggest either getting an NES to play the original, an SNES for G3 and for your PS2 go out and spend the extra for Gradius 5 which is a completely new version of Gradius that actually decides to USE the PS2's graphical power. But avoid this rush job at all costs!"
1154,1,"I did not purchase this game. I was a BETA tester. The game isn't bad. Pretty much ""more of the same"" with little new in the way of features. Missing the humor and overall vibe you expect with the Red Alert series. I would still purchase the game if not for the DRM scheme. EA, learn your lesson. This is not going to be a successful model. Go back to Westwood values."
1155,1,"It broke quick, my labtop too, I don't like it :)"
1156,1,"The game is fun for a little while, the story is boring and seems like it was written by a 13 year old who is writing a short story for class.  As for the game, the item grind is not really an item grind. YOU will not find any items worthwhile, your only bet to get great gear is playing the stock market aka auction house.  You buy low sell high so you can buy something else.  That's where you will spend half your time, hoping to find that rare item much cheaper than all the rest and then selling it for a profit. So you can buy another item that you'll use for 5 levels before it becomes obsolete.  Rinse and Repeat, so if you're looking for a great economics simulator this is it.  But be warned fun runs out fast."
1157,1,"I regret buying this game not because is bad game at all
but because in trying to free some some memory the system erased all my save game information on all my pS2 games and reformatted the memory card. the game seems to be a good game though."
1158,1,"At the start, the controller seems nice. It's light, and the buttons are easy to use. However, after about two months of use, the joysticks start to wear down. After about four months, they are almost unusable. They are poorly made, and can't stand even a tiny drop. And let's face it, it is very possiblr. Inside (because I wanted to see if I could adjust the wore dwn joysticks) the battery is just loosely hanging there, as are all of the parts. Don't buy this, save for a dualshock 3. It is more expensive, but it's better than buying a new sixaxis ever few months."
1159,1,"Nintendo lives in the past there is no Ethernet, no Blu ray, and no hard drive just little memory card built in 32 GB is not enough. WII U gamepad is the worst the most annoying part is the batteries eats up too freaking fast. Okay no problem time to charge it in the Wii U USB port ""What! you can't"" Outlet charging only. ""what is this the year 2000 come on Nintendo give me a break here"" So... screw Nintendo and there WII U."
1160,1,2k should have never taken over the WWE games. They stripped the create a character to bare bones. Barely anything left unless you want to buy extras. The reversals by the AI are a joke. No matter your level they just nearly reverse everything. After months of playing the timing for your reversals is still off and makes no sense.
1161,1,"Wow EA really jacked this one up. Sims 2 was probably the single greatest wide interest game ever made. Appealing to everyone from 8 year old kids to baby-boomers, there was so much right about the game (ease of use, the fun of designing and building custom houses, the excellent expansion packs, the fantastic user made content, etc.) that perhaps it would be unfair to expect Sims 3 to be better than Sims 2. However, I AT LEAST expected it to be playable, and reasonably similar to Sims 2 in quality and fun. To sum up the rest of this review: It's nowhere close. It stinks. It's unplayable due to crashes (for me at least). It's a buggy, unfun, massive step backwards from Sims 2.

So what makes it so bad?

First off, the game crashes nearly constantly. It is not my computer. I own and successfully play dozens of computer games including the most graphics intensive on the market. (For the nerds, I have a i7 processor, 6gb ram, and crossfired ATI HD4870s). These problems are due to buggy code and terrible beta testing. This game should never have been released in this state of unfinished unplayability.

They have also removed many of the things I liked best about Sims two like the ability to construct a neighborhood from scratch and then play each family and watch your Sims interact, make friends and enemies, get married to each other, etc... You are now forced to play a single family at a time. Start a new family and your old ones become NPCs (non player controlled) characters. You can never go back once you start a new one. Why EA, why? This singlehandedly ruined the game for me.

Next is the drastic step backwards in ease and fun of playability. Why they decided to jack with the control mechanisms that every Sims 2 player is accustomed to, or slow time down to the point that I started falling asleep watching my Sim sleep with nothing to do in the game to keep me interested, and why EA released the game with a deplorably low number of home furnishings, I don't know. It's like a horrible nightmare where instead of games progressing and improving, they're regressing towards oblivion. The menus are just clumsy, hard to use, and so very much worse than Sims 2. If you loved the Sims 2 menus, you will HATE these.

The camera is also bad, in that sort of early generations Nintendo 64 way where you can never get it to do what you want it to do with regularity. It seems to have a mind of its own, and controlling it is as frustrating as the terrible controls.

Making attractive Sims is about as easy as sculpting the masterpiece David from play dough. All my Sims look fat, ugly, and just not what I had in mind. It is Uber hard to get a face the way you want it to look. It is even harder to make a nice looking Sim than the character creation system in Oblivion: The Elder Scrolls. If you like plump, slightly froggish looking Sims, you'll love it.

For interior design, rather than giving you a solid and complete set of home furnishings, you are instead offered very few selections, but the ability to make them patterned. Oh joy! What I really want is about 6 options of sofas, most of them ugly, but that I can apply plaid or camouflage skins to! That's so much better than having say 12 sofa varieties right? Not so much. This strikes me as either laziness, or that EA released the game intentionally sparse so they can sell even more add on packs later. Except they missed the entire point: the reason they sold so many add on packs for Sims 2 was that the core game was so good!

Overall this might be one of the worst failures in modern PC game history. Destroying a famed (even legendary) series of games like the Sims franchise by changing core elements and just doing a flat out poor job of quality control is abysmal. EA will need to heavily patch this game to make it worth playing, and by the time they do that, it might be too late.

My recommendation: sell your copy on an auction site. At least then you can get back some of your money and buy something else."
1162,1,"This product is so comically bad, I don't even know where to begin. First off, the product packaging is so flimsy that a strong gust of wind could potentially blow it apart. The adapter creaks when handled even gently. Then, I tested with two different Windows PCs, and both times it failed. It could not even detect a plugged-in PS2 Dual Shock controller. Next, the ""driver disc"" that came with the package could not be read by both PCs. How am I supposed to install the drivers if the driver disc is defective? Stay far, FAR away from this thing!"
1163,1,"Purchased Stubbs-Zombie, Spellforce Platinum and Gothic Gold.

I won't write another STARFORCE review: read Stubbs or Spellforce Platinum on my view and others on STARFORCE.

I already own Gothic 2; great game.
IMO, it's better than Gothic, which I rate 5 stars.
Get the original; less potential problems."
1164,1,"I am a huge Cod fan so this hurts me to say but there is really nothing going on here.  The story line is weak and the multiplayer is just more of the same.  Not terrible,  but nowhere near what cod used to be.  Very disappointed with where the series is going."
1165,1,"Horrible game bundle for the price. The Star Wars game sucks so bad. There absolutely no content in the game. NO CONTENT to sell it for that much. There's WAY better bundles for the price. Go look at Star Wars battlefront single game reviews and that game sucks. The best bundle is the uncharted bundle. You get not 1,not 2, but 3 games with that bundle. Way better bundle for the money. This bundle has no content for the price. Whoever you get this for will be very disappointed."
1166,1,"Whoever thought this was a good idea was out of their mind.  This sucks.  Horrid small library of games, horrid design, causes eye strain, uncomfortable to use and just plain sucks.  It's no wonder why it was quickly abandoned."
1167,1,"I was a ctually waiting in anticpation of this game when i heard of it but once i got it it was frustrating. Icouldn't even install it, and that was even after i traded with three different copies, my system is a p4 1.9ghz with a geforce 3 so it should've worked but didn't. avoid it save your money"
1168,1,Not compatible with all 360 games
1169,1,"I can't even begin to express how disappointing this game is. I first started up the game at midnight last night when it was released. I was impressed by the sound quality and by how fast the game ran. Loading screens were short, too. It immediately plopped me into Create-a-Sim, as if I were making a character for a single character game such as Skyrim or Dragon Age. That was different.

I immediately went into options and noticed something disturbing. There were almost no options for anything except graphics settings. The Sims has never been the best at providing a decent options menu (e.g., no custom keys) but this was even worse. You'd think they were trying to IMPROVE the game.

After this foreshadowing of what was to come (lack of options!) I started creating my first Sim. I was very excited for this Create-a-Sim that included dragging facial features to adjust them but honestly it was disappointing. Not only is the color wheel gone, but the colors selections are boring and horrible, especially for hair and skin. I can't say that there are too few hairstyles and clothing options because that's how it was in previous Sims games before expansions/DLC and mods. The face adjustment is a -slight- improvement over sliders but it really does NOT give you the ability to create more unique sims! It only makes it easier. It is VERY limited. For example, I was trying to adjust eyebrows and found that it kept putting a limit on how far I could move them up/down/out etc. It was extremely annoying.

I finished creating my sim with his clay-like hair and entered the game. This is where things got even worse. There are not only two neighborhoods but they are TINY! When I play the sims, I like to create a lot of them. Usually 20-30 of them, such as a few families and a lot of singles that I love to interact with and see who gets paired off, who stays single, etc. There are so few lots that I couldn't do this now. The grouping of lots and constant loading screens are annoying. There are so many things missing and not just what you'd normally expect from a Sims base game. I was bored within 2 hours. All that TS4 did was make me want to go play TS2 and TS3, which is exactly what I did after a few hours.

This is really a step BACKWARDS. When you make a sequel to a game it should be an IMPROVEMENT, removing or fixing previously bad/extraneous features and adding new ones, not dumbing everything down. For example, The Elder Scrolls series. Although Morrowind was arguably better than Oblivion, Bethesda always tries to add MORE to each new game. From Arena to Skyrim, the series has improved each time, with more graphics, better dungeons, more content, better combat, better music, better modding opportunities, etc. (Minus the always prevalent BUGS.)

EA could learn from Bethesda. Stop making your sequels worse. Make them better. ADD to the game. Fix what was wrong with the previous games. Don't take away the things that people enjoyed and give them very little in return!

Save your money on this one. Save it for the potentially awesome titles coming out in the next 6 months - the new Civilization game, Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire remakes, Dragon Age Inquisition, Pillars of Eternity, Tides of Numenera, Borderlands... Don't spend your $60-70 on this!"
1170,1,"This is incredible, this game has a ridiculous graphics downgrade after update. EA needs to fix this otherwise they will rouing the great game this was at lunch. I was playing at 3440x1440 ultra wide and UTRA settings  980ti sc and getting 80 FPS average. It was just incredible. Though I was not a big fan of the older guns and few other things I just so much loved performance and incredible graphics. Not anymore this has become a deception. Do not get until they do something about this. One other thing my game keeps crashing after the update"
1171,1,"Took several hours to install to begin with, then another few hours to try to download an update, which surprise surprise failed at the last possible second. From there I was unable to even play it. All available fixes I searched for online (that didn't involve downloading fifty other programs) failed to work and I just gave up."
1172,1,"I am a HUGE Metal Gear Solid fan, and I have every Metal Gear Game. I thought woah a new Metal Gear Game. So I got it, I didn't want to play it for an hour. It is reduced to a card game,a pethetic card game, and the story lines take you about 50 minuts. This is mostly reading, not a game."
1173,1,"I don't like the setting. Its like the 1800s, they have magic but use really old guns. Make it more futuristic where the bad guys are wearing like hi-tech armour and amazing weapons you can steal.

Dialogue is really old-fashioned and nowhere near enough swearing, should be brought up to date get with the times! Nowhere did I hear a hoo haa! in battle or any cool jokes because this game tries to be too serious.

No cover system. If you are getting attacked you cant hide behind cover and shoot from behind a wall like the greats. Put in a cover system so we can see whats happening and like handle the suckers who are trying to take us down!

Stealth - I really don't like and other players hate it too, so they should remove this and just like let us play with some silenced weapons at the most. They call me the ninja cos I bust a cap in you before you see me! But with reflex actions obviously, Im nowhere near cowardly enough to hide and shoot someone like.

I absolutely hate this game, its one of the worst games youll play for sure. Go get some Gears Of War 4 or try Infinite Warefare."
1174,1,"this 3rd person shooter is not that good to me at all. it would have been a better game if we had an option to change 3rd person to 1st person. the guns in this game is terrible. it takes an hold clip of bullets  to take one person down. if I would have known these issues exist I would have not bought it. can't wait until an call of duty game.
home front  is another 3rd person shooter as well. I may try it
this game is going back today."
1175,1,"I bought one for testing. I liked a lot and bought 2 more. One for PC. Two for Mac (work and personal). PC is fine. Mac is unusable.

Mac's driver is just not working on macOS Sierra (10.12.1).
Driver has updated latest and got worth.

Light does not turn off when Mac went to sleep. Solution is that pull out cable.

Driver software(Razer Synapse) does not initialize keyboard and mouse properly after OS launched.
Solution is that you need to open Razer Synapse manually and open Keyboard and Mouse setting every time.

Keyboard got sticky sometimes by software. Solution is just undo. If you cannot undo some software, you are out.

Mouse left click gets compromised as right click.
Solution is pull out mouse and keyboard cable and plug again. Only sometime it works.

Some wrong frequent input from keyboard or mouse, that makes active window inactive.
How can I use this?

It took to type this review over 20 min by plug out and plug in again and again.

Last option is reboot OS and hope recovered.

Better option is avoid their product on Mac.

Update on 2016-12-20
There were some update on macOS and Razer driver. The issue some issue resolved, but other issues came up.
It's OK for decoration, but not as a tool.

Update on 2017-10-15
It has problem with 2 of Win7 machine. It does not pick up mouse cursor movement all the time. Mouse cursor does not move about 15 second of time about every 10-15 sec. Other issue is about 1-2 min after recovery from hibernation. If you make circle my mouse, mouse cursor move rectangle shape sometimes. There're many glitch like this."
1176,1,"The worst bug apparently is limited to importing characters from original Dungeon Siege 2. Many (truly) folks, including me, can't even play the game because there is a limit to the number of characters, and this bug prevents you from switching characters in your group. For example, I tried to play a multiplayer party mode in which the limit was 3 characters. One early quest requires you to make a dwarf a member of your group. When you need to get your original party members back, the only way to do that is to release this dwarf to the Inn. When you do that, the game quits and when you start again, that character is gone from the game. There are many other problems related to this bug. This happened with both of my imported DS2 characters.

I would normally expect a patch to resolve this problem from the developers, but apparently the thinking is that this won't happen unless you import corrupted save files. My understanding is that they have not been able to figure out how these files get corrupted, even though they have been trying a long time. So I will be pleasantly surprised if they do find a way to fix this problem, but I'm not holding my breath.

In my opinion, the quality of Dungeon Siege 1 and Legends of Aranna was much better than anything after that, and Broken World is aptly named."
1177,1,Gave as a gift and tried to play once.  Recipient said it's not his kind of game.  Have away
1178,1,"I loved the size of the new PSTwo, but it is still overpriced.  You can buy an Xbox for this price.  Even though the Xbox is larger, it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you don't need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require.  True playstation has a larger number of games, but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months.  Such as Fable, Halo 2, MechAssault 2: Lone wolf ect.

Pros.
1. Small size and portable
2. Large game selection from PS1 and PS2 titles

Cons.
1. Priced as much as an Xbox (When this hits $100 dollars next year I will be first in line to buy it.)
2. Games graphically challenged compared to xbox
3. More money for memory cards including special memory cards for PS1 game saves.

Sony,take a hint and reduce the price of PSTwo or bundle it with memory cards, two controllers, and a game for this price."
1179,1,Doesn't work
1180,1,"Dragon Rising definitely has to be one of the worst game sequels I've ever played in my life.
The original Operation Flashpoint and its two expansions were awesome games that gave a nice taste of military tactics, shooting, driving and flying military vehicles, etc.

Dragon Rising has almost none of the components that made the original game so amazing.
This is basically just a first person shooter with a couple team mates to control, bare bones, and that's it, nothing more.
The graphics are absolutely abysmal. The game is so dark and muddy looking, it's really difficult to make out any detail at all. The draw distance is awful. The controls are clunky, the character movements are clunky. There is no fun to be had in this attrocious failure of a game. I just seriously cannot believe how bad this game really is, I mean wow!

I love military sims and this has to be the worst of any I've come across. Dragon Rising looks like a playstation 2 game and plays like a playstation one game. And once again the graphics, those god awful muddy graphics! In a military sim, it's a necessity to have decent graphics because much of the gameplay involves observing your surrounding environments for enemy forces. Good luck doing that in this game without permanently injuring your eyes from constantly straining them to make stuff out in the distance.

I can't believe this game is rated as high as it is, it should be less than 3 stars."
1181,1,"Got this for my arcade stick for my xbox one s. Stopped working after LESS THAN ONE DAY. Followed instructions. Tried to update the firmware using the Brook site support with no luck. Shouldn't be having issues after a day. Worked fine in my Hori Rap 4 Kai for a couple of hours, but $45 isn't worth LESS THAN ONE DAY of USE. Returning this item for a full refund. Better off getting another arcade/fight stick than trying this again.
Or, if you're inclined to install a universal pcb in your stick, go for it. Would be more bang for your buck."
1182,1,"This game is terrible. Muted colors throughout so it's hard to see what to do or interact with. Confusing level design. Terrible play quality.  And don't get me started on the three-step process to throw a ""grenade"" in which you end up dead!  I hate this game."
1183,1,This product did not play and of the games properly but it did ship fast.
1184,1,"This game was fun and enjoyable a first, but after you get further into it, An unnecessary Satanic Theme gets injected into the play. The player then has to draw pentagrams (with wii remote) on the patients in order to give the patients a better change at survival. Of course like I stated before it is completely unnecessary, and it was at that  point that I turned it off. So if you want your child to spend hours drawing pentagrams, while trying to perfect the art of drawing pentagrams, then this game is for you. Had it not been for the Satanic theme being sneaked in. I would have easily given it 4 stars, but I find attempts to warp the minds of the young, extremely offensive."

1190,1,"This is coming from a long time fan of the series. I purchased this game the day it came out, I beat the single player campaign and have spent at least a dozen hours playing online.

After being a big Star craft fan for so long I was psyched about this when it came out. I bought the original Star craft (with the zerg box) on the day it came out and I beat it 3 or 4 times, played the online for awhile and got many years of enjoyment out of it. So when Starcraft 2 came out it was a no brainer that I wanted it. Well much to my dismay part 2 is by far the inferior of the two games in just about every way possible. So Ill just give reasons why below I did not like Starcraft 2.

1) You do not ever get to explore the maps, create your own strategy or play how you want in the single player campaigns. Every single player map basically tells you what to do exactly and almost how to do it, the game holds your hand the entire time and guides you everywhere and giving you a cue every time something needs to be done. The entire game is literally a giant tutorial and nothing else. I never felt like I had a chance to explore, to set up defenses, to try and use strategy or anything on my own. Like for instance when you earn the ability to get siege tanks its because you ""find"" them on a mission, I use find loosely as its unavoidable to find them and then the rest of the map is setup specifically designed to let you use the siege tanks to win and doing so otherwise just doesn't work. Or one where again you ""find"" a vehicle and have to stop these trains, well unless you use the vehicles you ""found"" against the train you won't win. Every map is staged so you have exactly what you need and every map has a specific pre-designed way of beating it. They are all exactly as small as possible so you don't wander off and do something dumb like play your way. Every single player map is like playing a game of chess where the pieces are setup for you already and the only way to win is to do things the way a diagram laid out for you says.

2) Blizzards amazing story cut scenes are designed horribly. You'd think this was gears of war in space because all the men are these giant bulked out muscled guys that have to weigh 400lbs of pure muscle with arms so big that they are bigger than my torso. I thought we would get away from the chris redfield of resident evil 5 and gears of war school of character design. This is a little gripe yes but it kind of ruins my ability to suspend disbelief when every male in the game (aside from the skinny nerdy guy) look like they are smuggling car fenders on their clothes.

3) I still dislike that I paid 60 bucks for 1/3 of a game. I know blizzard said many times that they couldn't put all of the campaigns in here due to time and so on. But I look back at Starcraft and warcraft 3 where they managed to fir great multiplayer, many single player missions for all 3 races and a complete storyline onto a single 700mb cd but they can't do it with a dvd or two now also? I don't like the idea of paying 180 dollars to play all 3 races. Now since they merged with activision this tactic or more money is becoming more evident, I don't think it has anything to do with time or whatnot. Since merging with activision their prices have gone up, starcraft 2 cost 60 when they used to cost 50 like all of pc games, the starcraft 2 collector's edition now costs 100 when it used to be blizzard only charged 60 for the collector editions, the WOW:CATA collector's edition also got its price raised by like 30 bucks. The game was chopped up into 3 parts so they could sell more and nothing else.

4) Every other mission I felt like I was being rushed as much as possible in the single player campaign. It seems like every other mission has a timer of some sort. Save the colonists before the protoss kill them, destroy the trains before 5 get away, get out before the never ending wave of zerg kill you and so on. Way to often the game is rushing you through the map.

5) Even if you don't play online, you still have to connect to your online account to play. You have to get a battle.net account, you have to register your games cdkey and you have to be connected to your battle.net account before you can play a offline single player game. I don't like having to login so I can play a game offline.

6) There is no LAN support in the game meaning if I want to play with friends we are forced to go online and get funneled through the battle.net service. I don't like that, I liked being able to get on a LAN with my friends right there and play 100% lag free with no problems. But blizzard removed that feature purely so were forced to us their battle.net service in order to keep us on their servers. So the people I play with we tried it a couple times and didn't like it, so we fired up the original Starcraft instead and played on the lan and had more fun actually.

7) The multiplayer still sucks because of how the game is designed. Unless you practice and follow the exact same build order as found on online faq's like everyone else you'll get crushed online. The game is inherently flawed for online play to give victory to people who build stuff in a certain way. Play against a terran and watch them and they will all build the same things in the places in the same order. If you enjoy playing others but don't like following the exact same pattern every time you play and play to rush through as fast as possible then you won't have much success online or much fun either.

All in all blizzard has made Starcraft 2 vastly inferior to Starcraft 1 in every way possible. Aside from the fact the graphics are nice in part 2 there isn't a thing I liked as much as or better. I can't recommend this game unless it costs 15 bucks or less to you."
1191,1,"Marvel Nemesis is a very boreing game. There are only 2 attack methods, the X button to punch, and the Circle button to grab.

The graphics are average, there is nothing about the graphics that makes it stand out from other games.

If you want a fighting game with comic book characters, your money is better spent on Spawn for Dreamcast. It's a similar game where you can throw objects and find weapons in the environment. But it's a LOT MORE FUN than this Nemesis game !"
1192,1,"Rockstar really shot themselves in the foot with this one. This game has 3 different kinds of DRM, none of which work very well. If you can get SUCK U ROM to verify that its actually a real DVD (which it doesnt always do) youve still got to contend with verifying 2 different codes with rockstars webpage AND sign up for rockstars steam-wannabe system AND sign up with microsoft live gaming whatever the heck that is.

Thats right, you have to sign up with TWO DIFFERENT ONLINE GAMING SYSTEMS to play this SINGLE PLAYER GAME.

After two days of messing with this, I never got further than the loading screen. This game is buggy as heck and it is impossible to tell if its crashing because of securom, rockstar-steam, MS live, or just poor coding in the game itself.

Rockstar used to make quality games that ran good and were fun to play. GTA4 shows that this is no longer the case.

Not only will i be returning GTA4... I will be avoiding rockstar games altogether after this DRM abortion. Its not even worth the discounted $20 price."
1193,1,"You aren't buying a disc that's usable for playing the game. You might as well just buy the download version, you need constant internet access to play this and will end up downloading even with this disc."
1194,1,"This mouse is garbage. I was trying to save a few bucks buying this instead of a Razer of Logitech but I regret it. On the desktop, the sensitivity is fine and I can set it to whatever I want. Inside ANY game, the sensitivity is crazy high. I have turned down the in game mouse settings as well and the Windows mouse settings and it is still insanely. I makes 1st person games unplayable. When I plug in any other mouse to my computer, I do not have this problem at all"
1195,1,"Installs Securom.  This is one of those copyright protection programs that you may never be rid of.  Many people have had issues including myself with starting the game because incompatibilities between securom and other software makes securom think the DVD is a copy.  Do some reading and you will also see that Sega offers no solution.  Its been 18 months now, still no fix.  Do your self a favor and try a game that does not have these frustrations.

Hail Flavius."
1196,1,This game is really bad tom clancy really jacked this game up first of its fun but it got to the poibt its not fun any more team killing happens almost all the time and vote to kick people abuse that remove kick vote and team killing this game would be much better this happens all the time whats the point in playing if you get team killed or kicked
1197,1,Fantastic Game but this survival edition is a piece of Junk. All it came with was an alarm clock and its really crappy. Was totally not worth the extra money. Just but the collectors edition instead. i will never again purchase an amazon.com exclusive collectors edition again based on this purchase.
1198,1,"one major flaw ruins this entire game...

yes you guessed it, persistent internet connection is required. If you are not connected to Battle.net servers at all times the game WILL NOT function...period! so if you disconnect mid boss fight or right before you reach a checkpoint, yep you guessed it, all your progress will be lost and you will have to start from your previous checkpoint. No, there is no SAVE GAME function in Diablo 3, the servers auto save for you at each checkpoint only.

Personally, the game content itself could be phenominal and I really wouldn't care, the explicit decision to make a  ""single player game"" a INTERNET ONLY game is absolutely convolted idiocy. Unless Blizzard makes HUGE changes to this game I would be seriously surprised if this game continues to sell its copies.

To be clear, I did not by this game. I was one of the many who received a free copy for commiting to WOW for a year. Having said that, I would not buy this game nor recommend it to anyone. I would recommend it to someone I disliked to have sweet revenge but that is it."
1199,1,"I have little patience when it comes to games like this.  Makes me wish I hadn't bought it and I am still trying to get rid of it.  Before buying take mine I will mail it to you before I hurl it through the wall.  EGM  said this was a good game and usually they are right.  Well they blew it  this time.  Don't get me wrong it might be fun.  Good concept, interesting  story,  Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss  fights.  I never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until  I died 50 times in a row.  O' YE OF LITTLE PATIENCE AVOID THIS ONE!"

1201,1,I bought TWO different Assassin's Creed bundles last Black Friday. Neither of which worked. You lost me Microsoft. The controller is well designed but I question the quality and I penalize the controller (which I returned to Wal Mart and got $59.99 plus tax back for on a Wal-Mart gift card after paying $39.99. for it..take that corporate America) with a 1 star rating. Windows 8 and now this. You aren't Apple. Stop trying to be.
1202,1,"had this controller for one week and d-pad just broke off playing street fighter 4. was good while it lasted but the buttons started dying too. by the way, this is my 2nd controller. the 1st one lasted only 2 days. save your money and buy an arcade stick. do not buy the madcatz fightpad either for ps3 because that's junk too. go with an arcade stick and swap out the parts with japanese sanwa denshi."
1203,1,This product didn't work at all. This is the third one I bought. Don't buy used. I am not mad. It's just that it doesn't work.
1204,1,"This makes no sense as a retail product. If you have a decent internet connection, you can buy this for cheaper via download. If you are looking for a disc version to avoid the download for whatever reason, this is not it as it just forces you to input a code and do a full download. Basically, this is a waste of shelf space."
1205,1,The game didn't read
1206,1,"same problem as everyone else.  Started with scratchy noise and one ear went out, then mic went out, then everything! Lasted 3 months. My son's friend bought the same headset and returned it one week later for the scratchy sound. Ugh"
1207,1,"First of all, what were the people who designed this mat thinking??? It's ugly and the colors clash. Also, soft mats slip around way too much. You can't beat hard songs and it is frustrating even getting good scores on the easy songs. The response on soft mats is unreliable and unpredictable. If you want to enjoy DDR, you're going to have to shell out for the expensive hard pads. Sorry people, there is no cheap way out of this one. And don't let any seller convince you that foam on the bottom of a soft mat or an anti-slip cover will make it better, because it won't."
1208,1,"They call it ""Director's Cut"" yet it is the only version with censorship! This is deceptive and they should have put some type of warning label saying that this was the censored version."
1209,1,"I received this a while ago in hopes of repairing my original NES. I was all excited and got everything disassembled, replaced the pin connector, put it all back together exactly how I should. Hooked it up, popped a game in and immediately noticed two things:

1) The pins simply do not work. I no longer get a flashing screen, but one steady screen of the same color.
2) The pins are way too tight. I had to kinda force the game in, and had the most difficult time taking the carts back out.

If you're looking at this product page, chances are you're in a similar predicament that I was in. I would suggest either finding a different kind of pin connector set, have someone else do the work for you, or better yet, just replace the NES or get a clone console. This pin set will only cause frustrations and headaches."
1210,1,"This might be a great game, no way to tell. Cant get it to run. Error 12. Did as the website said, NO JOY. Submitted a ticket, 1 to 2 days response time. Forget it. Sending it back. Dont waste your time
Amazon gave a full refund they are the best:-)"
1211,1,What a cheap made piece of crap!!!!
1212,1,"to old, it wasn't what i expected.  i should've done more research on the game first, before buying."
1213,1,"What is it with Nintendo as of late? They seem to have turned into the new sega with all their addons and accessories just to play their already scaled down games.

So far just to play the handful of games I own for the Wii I had to buy the Wii mote, Nunchuck, Classic controller, Game Cube Controller, the Madcatz Arcade Stick (a must have for capcom fighters) and this Motion plus thing just to get my original wii mote to work better.

For the money I dropped into the Wii I could of purchased a system that offered more of the type of games I was interested in playing and not this overpriced partyware/fitness console.

Oh it might sound like I'm bashing the Wii but honestly I'm just dissapointed with the direction Nintendo has gone in as of late. I've always supported Nintendo and brought just about every console they released but I think this will be my last one for now.

The Wii motion plus is just an attachment that connects to the bottom of your wii mote. It comes with a rubber grip but no rubber grip for the nunchuck? Why is that? because Nintendo wants you to spend more money and buy the Nunchuck grip seperately or spend another 20 bucks as it only comes packaged with the grip for the standard wii mote. The wii mote plus is a lot more accurate. I thought it was a gimmick but it really does improve the responsiveness of the standard wii mote.

There you have it. Pay 20 bucks to correct Nintendo's flawed wii-mote design.

Well... what more can I say about the product? I didn't have to buy it, but I brought it because I wanted to improve the game play on the few wii games that I do own. Even still I'm bitter that I spent $20.00 on something that should of been more like 5 or 10 dollars. I'd rather put that towards purchasing a game than fixing Nintendo's problem. It's something that you honestly do need because it corrects an error with the current wii mote. Despite what they advertise it as this is really a fix for the controller.

1 star because this product shouldn't even exist. Nintendo's R&D team should have spent more time developing the wii mote to actually work properly."
1214,1,Pure crap

1220,1,This was a very disturbing game. Whoever thought this game up has a genius but sick mind. I do not recommend this game to the faint of heart.
1221,1,"I'm a sid meiers junkie and have played pretty much all of his games since Civ1 and was in love with all of them up to this game at which point I'm just now disappointed with what his studious put out.

The game play itself is really great and the graphics are awesome. It's too bad that after 30-50 turns the game becomes unplayable due to performance and you'll never get to actually finish a game that you start.

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did. Of course the joke is on everyone because the game runs slow even on higher end systems. I have a friend running a PC with 32GB of RAM and two NVIDIA 680's in SLI with a 256GB SSD and even on that beast of a machine the game crawls to a screaching halt of performance after about 40 turns. The farm graphics disappear completely from the screen so knowing what is built on a tile requires you to hit F10 to see what's actually there or to hover the mouse over each tile until you find something that you haven't built on.

Summary: Good game made bad by Steam DRM and poor coding.

What I would like to see Firaxis explain: How much did firaxis pay for this to win game of the year and did the people who gave the award get to actually play a complete game all the way through on a huge map with multiple city states and civ's? If so, what was their trick to actually getting the game to work the way that it should?"
1222,1,This was so difficult to play that I didn't bother to finish it. I had played the first one. This one required that I use a walk thru right from the start which is more work than I want to put in to play a game.
1223,1,"it broke in 5 months of using it, the paint was chipped and it was pretty bad"
1224,1,"Need a group game to play at my place so i went to gamestop and got this turd. you would think playing this together will be fun, but you are dead wrong. The game sucks and it only cause us to yell at each other, after 20 min we stop and gave up. We just watch the lion king and eat chicken wings with french fries. the food was good so we had fun that day."
1225,1,Don't buy this game.
1226,1,"Just received my ""Cronusmax Plus"" and after some fiddling around in setting up my specs for the game, here is what I encountered thus far;

After inputting my desired game packs and modifying the parameters, ""I can't hear or talk with other players from my earphone which is hooked up to my controller!?""  I've tried for hours in figuring out how to reestablish connection to no avail.  I've had to resort to sound from my ""monitor and advise my friends on the PS4 that I can't hear or speak with them but still able to play the game.""  I've contacted the manufacture to no avail with how to resolve this issue.....

I will post additional information as this is an on-going evaluation.  Still no word to address my issue, which has been over a week so i guess you're on your own when you purchase the product..... Sad..."
1227,1,I hade sun tachos but my mom cook them hamburg in teh shells too long so soggy bottom tryied to pray game but then hamburg fell out of bottum and all over my lap on the flor and on the box cover of the gane.

1228,1,"From watching videos of this game on YouTube,I can tell that ""Shadow Of Mordor"" is absolutely beautiful on next generation consoles. The gameplay looks great and seems very smooth,the graphics are amazing,the nemesis system is interesting and the presentation is overall beautiful. Sadly,the same cannot be said for the last gen version of this game(at least the Xbox 360 version anyway). For starters,the graphics are DREADFUL! HONESTLY! I've seen better looking graphics on original Xbox games from 2003! The textures in this version of ""Mordor"" are downright UGLY! While the combat isn't all that bad,the game often time lags and there are occasional freeze-ups during gameplay and main mission cut scenes. One in particular froze up on me THREE times! I thought for sure,that I was going to have to return this game,but fortunately it finally started working. I couldn't continue on with this review,without also mentioning the annoying loading times. Every single time you exit the options menus,to tweak your options or to upgrade your items,the game loads for about 10 seconds. It's SO agravating! There are also occasional cut aways during certain cut scenes. Clearly ""Shadow Of Mordor"" was meant to be on next generation hardware,and this mess of a port REALLY shows it. The last generation version of ""Mordor"" was even delayed for two months,probably due to hardware restrictions and the programmers trying to FORCE this game on last gen consoles. Overall,this is a great game...just not on Xbox 360 and probably PS3 too. If you want to enjoy ""Shadow Of Mordor"" how it was MEANT TO BE,then buy it for Xbox One or Playstation 4."
1229,1,"I have bought this game on release day and so far I have not managed to connect to a single online server. Every time I attempt it disconnects me and I need to restart the game altogether. When putting a ticket out this is the exact answer I got; ""The Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising servers are currently experiencing excess demand, as everyone tries to connect to the game following the worldwide launch. We are working with the company that runs these servers in an attempt to increase this bandwidth, however we would expect demand to reduce following the peak that we expect this weekend, and so you should be able to connect more consistently after this time.""

It has been a week and nothing has changed. Buy this game only if your planning to play it single player. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
1230,1,"Paying to play with Bots, Hackers, and Idiots. If I had to sum up my WoT gameplay experience that would be it.

I played up to Tier 9 (10 total tiers). I spent a lot of time on this game before I gave up. Here is my final review of the game:

No matter what you like about this game they will change it in the next patch. Particular vehicles, classes, maps, whatever.

Don't even think about building up your arty. They nerf it over and over and over. If you were unfortunate enough to have rolled arty a few years ago then you pretty much lost all that progress as they took every single ounce of fun out of arty. What they do is change the game mechanics to your shot has a lesser chance of hitting, then they slow your reload and increase the time it takes to aim. You can literally do your homework while waiting for arty to reload.

Getting a good tank is a matter of luck. You might spend months playing a particular research line (as it takes that long) only to find out that there is a TERRIBLE tank in that line. One that will take months upon months of playing a tank you hate. You have three choices at this point 1) play another tank then pay (a lot: $20+) to convert your experience, 2) play through it. 3) Start another line from scratch. World of Tanks knows you'll eventually just get frustrated and pay your way through. WoT also uses patches to change the stats on vehicles. You might find a tank you really like but they change it so you will want to play something else. They absolutely do this on purpose. Why? To keep you moving up lines and buying gold to skip almost unplayable tanks.

The game is built to encourage people to buy gold. The model works for sure. But, if you aren't one of those people thats going to put money into every single round then don't expect to do very well. If you don't have a premium tank you don't make as much silver (money), don't get as good of match making (who you fight against) and your crew increases in experience slower. Pretty much, you can grind for months and get now where.

Micro-transactions are a huge part of this game. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you aren't will to pay and pay often. It isn't cheap. I have probably spent over $150 on this game so far. Now that I'm not spending more money on it the enjoyment level went WAY down.

Edit: for those of you who think you'll get to T10 then just play that, you're wrong. Those tanks lose money on average, so you're forced to play lower tiers (which only make a small amount of money), buy and exchange gold, or buy a premium tank."
1231,1,"I remember this game being way more fun on the computer. For some reason, the ds version was just a disaster. Horrid graphics, and gets boring very quickly. I'm kinda disappointed..."
1232,1,"Why it stinks?

1: there's only 8 missions per good or evil side, and no world map to choose where to go, you're trapped in the story.

2: The voiceovers are horrible compared to the old one, and just mimic the old ones, not very authentic at all, shameful.

3: The character pictures are done in cartoon, and substandard.

Why it's good.

1: There's trolls in it, we all love those, or love to hate them.

2: That's it, i've got nothing else. Someone shoot me for spending $60 on this sorry knockoff unworthy of even being qualified as an expansion."
1233,1,"I'm a gamer.  Sure - I've not spent half my life or more grinding out every single achievement on every single mindless game out there - but I've put in enough time on titles such as Oblivion, Skyrim, Eco Draconis etc. to feel that I know reasonably well what I'm talking about with respect to RPGs and game playability in general.

I bought Dark Souls because of the review on Gamespot.  There - I said it.  I mean - come on.  This thing is ranked fourth best XBox title OF.  ALL.  TIME.  It's up there with GTAIV and the original GoW.  How could I go wrong buying this?  Well - the other night I tore off the cellophane wrapper from this game and found out.

Most of the great reviews of this title praise it neverendingly for its realistic gameplay and unforgiving style.  Yes - on the back of the box it says ""Prepare to Die"".  This should actually have been rewritten to read ""Prepare to spend hours on this game and get nowhere - then die.""

First of all, you spend about an hour designing your character - only to find that you cannot click accept and start the game.  Why?  Well - after about 30 mins of Googling, I discovered that this was because I had not specified a NAME for my character.  Which was intended to go in one of the nondescript, unlabeled black boxes in the character creation screen.  Okay.  I guess that obscurity and sheer non-intuitiveness should have been my first warning.

Secondly - when you are finally thrust into the game, you are faced with a cheesy-sounding female voice actor who is SO overly dramatic and theatrical with her emphases etc. that she sounds like a reject from Lord of the Rings.  She walks you through what is - I GUESS - an apparent run-down of the world you are about to be thrust in to, talks about nymphs and bad guys and gods and omnipotent beings with weird names.  None of which means anything to you - because this is your first experience of the game.  I think the devs for this story really failed to appreciate that their curve was all off here.  How can I care about a story if I don't even understand what its main elements are/about?

Thirdly - THEN, you discover that that nice shiny character you spent an hour developing.....well, you can't use her.  Or him.  You are actually an undead type zombie thing, rotting in a prison until some faceless character breaks you out with a broken sword hilt.  Mmmmkay.  You then proceed to break out of the undead asylum by fighting zombies and skeletons, all the while trying to master the control and inventory system, which leads me to.......

FOURTHLY.  The controls and inventory system.  They're horrible.  Not only do they LOOK like the were designed for the NES - they ACT like they were designed for the NES.  You can't pause the game - so, tough luck.  IF you actually manage to find a quiet area to delve into your menus and inventory/equipment list, you will be faced with a dizzying array of items that you have picked up - with no clue as to what any of them do.  'Humanity'?  'Firebombs'?  'Souls'?  Do you actually know what any of those does?  No?  Why - you must have not sat down and spent hours reading every little load screen card that pops up in intricate detail.  Silly you!  You want to equip that new shield you just found?  Tough luck - because while you (the player) are sitting there squinting at the inventory lists trying to figure them out - guess what?  A horde of lying-in-wait skeletons have r@ped your character in the meantime.

Aaaaand fifthly.  Gameplay and combat.  Wasn't this supposed to be an RPG?  Because I have spent four days on this game, completed the 'tutorial' and made it to the first city.....or realm.....or place.......or whatever it is, and I still HAVE YET to find any true RPG-ing aspects to it.  What I saw was basically a hack-n-slash walkthrough without a plot that is insanely hard.  And talking about hacking and slashing - yeah, you can forget that.  If you are not interested in picking your way around corners like a field mouse looking out for enemies, and choosing your skirmishes with intelligent discerning - you can forget playing this game.  See those two skeleton derps in the distance?  Well - unless you want to die quickly, you'd better not fight them.  But wait - what's that?  You HAVE to fight them to proceed?  Well crap.....

The combat is really rudimentary and random.  Camera angles seem to actively HINDER you instead of help you - and there's a lot of generic, recorded ""muaaahhhh!""s or ""acckk!""s from the zombies when you kill them.  Animation doesn't fare any better.  I literally took on three skeletons at the same time last night, and while sitting there mashing the trigger to slash them, I saw each and every one of them animate in the same way, take the same hits in the same places, fall down and die in the same manner at the same time.  Is this the XBox 360 or the NES?

SIXTHLY.  That mashing I was talking about?  Get ready to do it.  A LOT.  Combat and fighting skills seem to account for nothing - each button on the controller seems to be linked to a random assortment of attacks with your sword that really seem to mean nothing.  You will hack and slash your way through every area, not caring what you hit so long as you're alive afterwards.  Except when you press a button once too many times, and it locks you into a five-second-delayed triple-strike animation that sends you flailing past that skeleton you were trying to hit because you didn't line it up exactly (*EXACTLY*) right, and powering on into another horde of enemies that will subsequently r@pe you.  And kill you.  Which, in turn, means that......

SEVENTHLY.  You die.  Dying seems to be an intrinsic mechanic in this game - but not in the fun sense.  They scoured any fun out of it by respawning ALL non-boss enemies when you die.  Not only that - but there is no way to save at a certain point.  NES come to mind?  The game utilized 'bonfires' as some sort of would-be 'calm-amongst-the-storm' moment of reflection - but all they are is checkpoints.  You die - you respawn at a bonfire.  All that grinding you did to get up to that bell?  Well forget it - you got killed.  You just wasted 45 minutes of your life because you didn't coax your enemies into a certain area which means you could face them one by one instead of all together......or you stepped off a cliff........or you got pelted by a firebomb while trying to walk along a bridge.

EIGHTHLY.  This is an RPG?  Holy cow.  I would have never guessed.  The story is convoluted and reads like some kind of druggie on meth put pen to paper, with random stuff thrown in that we are just supposed to accept just......well, because.  I have encountered a total of two NPCs - there's no dialogue with them or option to say things to them.  They just talk at you.  In their stupid, inflated, overly-dramaticized ways.  Remember the villains from your favorite kid's cartoon like Skeletor from He-Man or something?  Well - if you like that sort of voice acting you're in for a field day in Dark Souls.

There is no map, no world map, no sandbox feeling, no free roaming.  It's a hack-n-slash game with a trumped-up story that inflates it's own self-importance.  As an Oblivion/Skyrim/Bethesda fan - that's where I'm staying.  Screw this.

1234,1,Game won't download and i cant redeem the cd key on steam or rockstars website.
1235,1,Unless u want ur order messed up I recommend u not to use them very bad not Even worth the one star
1236,1,"I purchased this game because, I had purchased the Ridge Racer Unbounded so I thought it was gonna be cool, not as good as the Unbounded but good enough. However, when I opened up the game and played it, I got disappointed. When you see the intro, the game looks amazing but, when you actually start playing, it is not entertaining at all. The game is so so so easy than even i if you try to crash, the cars refused to do it. No matter how hard you try, I will never crash. The graphics on the game are really bad.

I am 22, I am used to play games like forza motorsport, grand turismo, formula 1 and things like those. So you can see where i am coming from.

I recommend this games to children who just want to have fun and race. If you want to have a real racing experience, buy one of the games i mentioned before.

Also, I suggest not do buy like the previous series of games that you played thinking that they are good as well because you will find nothing but disappointment."
1237,1,"Overall, horrid sound quality make great design and a cool concept worthless. Although I can hear others crystal clear, friends say it sounds like I swallowed the mic instead of having it around my neck. One commented that it sounds like I'm being mauled by a bear. The only time it sounded crystal clear to them was when I was standing up to grab my wireless headset. Believe it or not, I don't feel like standing up every time I want to use this. It appears to boil down to either bad wiring or a bad connection. If you're still willing to try your luck and would like to know more about the design then read on.

One of the primary issues with the MW3 version of the same mic seemed to be the ""one size fits all"" that didn't fit all. This version is expandable. Each side has 4 settings for a total of 8 possible sizes. Each setting seems to expand it about an eighth of an inch for a total of (go math skills!) an inch of customization to play with.

A sturdy, adhesive backed, foam rubber strip is included to go along the inside of the back of the collar. Does this make much of a difference? I don't think so. If there were more weight to it and if it rested on your neck rather than wrapping around it, maybe it would.

The connection going into the controller is looser than it should be. I'm using it with the new GoW3 controller so it's not like it's an old controller that has worn from excessive use. It has fallen out without me noticing once. It also crackles here and there when moved. The wiring and connection design seem to be flawed.

Lastly, there is ample length to the wires, but wireless would have been much preferred. Unfortunately, Microsoft won't allow third party developers to create wireless peripherals. Without getting into my personal politics on this policy, I'll just say that you can't fault Madcatz for this shortcoming.

In the end, it looks like I'll be attempting to return this item for a refund."
1238,1,"I realize this game came out before the god of war series on the SNES i believe, but it seemed like a God of War wannabe. The camera movements were ridiculous and the story wasn't even good. I couldn't even beat it, it was that boring."
1239,1,"I have been a Sudoku fan for about 3 years now.  I do well at solving the ""difficult"" and ""fiendish"" puzzles in the New York Post Sudoku books (in my opinion are the best Sudoku books out there).  I thought I'd divert from these puzzles and try a shot at Platinum Sudoku after reading some of the reviews.

So far I've spent about 3-4 hours playing and have only solved 10 puzzles.  The puzzles are frustrating and challenging.  The ""Easy"" mode is not that easy, and I've barely scratched the surface on ""Medium"" mode. The numbers in ""draft"" mode (for guessing numbers)is so small that you have to get out your reading glasses to see what you've marked.  Also, the default font is incredibly hard to read and to get used to.  Unless you unlock some new fonts by completing several puzzles, there's really not a good font to select.  That alone makes the puzzles difficult to complete.  One of the things I have to agree with many other reviewers is the stupid girl and guy that supposedly pumps you up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something after completing a puzzle.  Give me a break!  It would have been nice to have the option to turn this feature off, similar to the music option.

The graphics are okay, but that's not what a good Sudoku puzzle is all about.

All in all, this game will be on my ""used games to sell"" list.  My friend has ""Ultimate Puzzle Games-Sudoku Edition"" and this beats out Platinum Sudoku by far.  I'm also sticking to the old school version of paper and pencil with a real eraser!!"

Sadly you don't get to pick your character & story
You have to play what the game gives you & i hate it
The gameplay is awefull

Can finish off a bad guy without wasting a turn
Cant let a team die
This game sucks & its stupid"
1241,1,"This game cannot be purchased, you can only rent it due to the horrible DRM system. Don't support customer abuse; don't buy this game until Ubisoft removes the product activation limit!"
1242,1,"This is for the delevery of the game and not the actual game.

I have a very poor internet connection - I got hosed by a girl at the cable company telling me our future home was able to get broadband - only to finish the build and move in and before anything was hooked up I called for broadband... nope we don't service that area (would have never bought the house had I known)

Anyway - I bought the disk copy of this game and i am not sure why... I guess all you are doing is buying the key code and you can use the disk as a coffee coaster.  You must install the entire game via download (for me 1 day and 18 hours)  Ugh.  So I guess it will add anticipation for this game.

Huge fan of Fallout 3 / vegas... can't wait to actually play this."
1243,1,I just played this so I can have Jirachi
1244,1,"I am 30 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Alien films, I was 16 or 17 when the first Alien vs Predator game came out and I loved it. I have always been a PC gamer and have stuck with it through the hardest of times both for me and for PC gaming itself. I enjoyed Borderlands 2, I thought it had some enjoyable coop but I quickly realized how the majority of fun came from the fact that I was playing with friends, not necessarily the game play.

This is not to say Borderlands 1 or 2 are bad games, they do what they set out to do well, and because of that I had faith that Gearbox would deliver at least a semi-decent product, but this game is one of the most shameful displays of a 2013 entertainment product that we will likely see all year. I actually went into this game expecting it to not be that great and I was still completely and utterly let down. I am also a pretty big Left 4 Dead fan and have 500 hours between both games clocked on my Steam account, Aliens Colonial Marines takes a few pages from L4D and shoves them into a lifeless, shell of a game.

There is not one single little detail that this game does better than anything else, and I say that with zero troll-ness in my heart, I say this because I really do not want people to waste their money like I did. I am a sucker. I fell for the marketing and the nostalgia brought on by my childhood. I should have realized that the embargo on reviews meant they knew it was bad, I should have listened to my gut when I first saw game play footage and the animations looked like something that came out before Doom 3. My friend and I are most of the way through the campaign right now and I had to quit because it was so mind-numbingly dull and repetitive. I will go back one last time to beat the campaign because I spent $50 on this ""game"", but I will never play it again after that, I will never pre-order another game and the chances of me buying another Gearbox title are pretty much slim to nil.

For reference my Game of The Year for 2012 was Far Cry 3."
1245,1,"This DS port of Syberia is just plain awful.  The DS version is actually from an earlier port of the cell phone version.  The thing that is wrong with this version is that this game is too watered down, and yes im aware that this a DS game and I shouldn't expect a full fledged PC adventure experience but seriously, this game is sad.  It has bad hit detection, which means you have to click on an object several times in order for the system to acknowledge what your clicking, the same song Loops throughout, no voice acting, graphics are junk which makes it hard to tell where to go and what is a obtainable item and overall its just a dull adventure.  I beg of you to pick up the PC or xbox version, which  are vastly superior in every way!!"
1246,1,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Worlds/dp/B000NJH6YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Worlds</a>

Two Worlds was something I had waited for.  Touted as The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion on steroids, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this; and as most things that get over hyped this one, too, fell on it's face and left a nasty mark.

Pros:  There are not many.  Character customization is simple. Game play is simple, press the button and bash something.  You can create your own weapons by combining two like weapons or adding an item, such a gem, to make the weapon stronger.  This also works with clothing (armor), and you can make your own spells by picking ingredients (if you can find them) in the wilderness.

You can not die, well you do, but instead of having to reload a prior save you are instantly ""resurrected"" at one of the many, many shrines you find along the road.

Cons: Story, if there is one somewhere, is your typical Fantasy fare.  You are the heir to a magic thingamabob, only you can use said magic thingamabob, bad guys want magic thingamabob, kidnapped your sister to force you to comply and go get / find magic thingamabob, blah-blah-blah, yawn.

The graphics are sub-par for what one has come to expect from the next-gen consoles.  You'd swear you were playing Gauntlet (arcade style graphics) or Baldur's Gate.  YIKES!  People look melted and backgrounds, although nicely done, tend to be muddy and mush into one big blob of grey-green space indiscernible from one area to another.

There is no tutorial, so to speak, and the on screen text will make you go blind, it is so bad you CAN NOT read it.  Legibility is the key to making a game fun for me!

The in game map is as close to useless as one can get, with no text or the same illegibility problem, navigating the rather large world takes some doing.

The voice acting is terrible!  I play with MUTE on!  I'm sure they tried very very hard and such a valiant  effort, but it is difficult to take all the ""Forsooth""-ing and ""Varlet""-ing when it is used in every sentence, it just kills the game.

A good intention gone horribly awry.  Don't waste you time unless you absolutely have to play another RPG or are a glutton or punishment."
1247,1,Tried to get into it. But it wasn't happening because I found Tekken more appeasing than the mortal kombat gore effect. Let an old friend borrow it; haven't seen it since. Oh well.

1250,1,"I've come to the conclusion that there are no decent gaming headsets under $100. I add this to the list headsets that are a waste of money.

First, the cord on the headset cannot be plugged into the xBox360 (regular not Elite edition). Turtle Beach advertises that this works with xBox360 and Playstation but those are usually hooked to televisions, and many people own HD TVs now. We have an HD TV so we cannot use this with our TV for console video gaming ""as is"". (A Tritton headset we own comes with the cord able to be used immediately, not this Turtle Beach headset.) After researching this problem I found that non-elite editions of the xBox360 need an adapter cable that you must purchase separately. I shopped for that product and found two non-Microsoft items for sale on Amazon (under $10) but customer reviews stated for both that due to the design and size of the inputs on the non-elite xBox360 adaptations would have to be made using screwdrivers, a hammer, and for one of them, a soldering iron. I read that the Microsoft cable costs $50 but was unable to find it for sale on the Microsoft xBox360 website to confirm. I was hoping for a headset that just plugs in, period. I note that with the HD TV you need both the HDMI cable for the video and the other outlet for the audio, that's the issue. The price of the official Microsoft HDMI dongle is $50 full retail (that adds a lot of cost to the lower price of this Turtle Beach headset.)

Second, These begin to hurt the ears and head after one hour of use.

There is high sound quality which is nice but if they hurt or are not compatible with your TV what good are they? There are other nice sounding headsets on the market.

Our family decided we'd use it with the laptop when watching homeschool lectures, online driving school lessons, listening to music with the laptop while doing other work with the laptop and using for gaming while on the laptop. However after an hour, there is pain, so I can't recommend this headset.

I recommend that you buy a high quality headset and treat it with loving care, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRITTON-Pro-5-1-Surround-Headset-for-Xbox-360-and-PS3-Black/dp/B00B1MVNDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRITTON Pro+ 5.1 Surround Headset for Xbox 360 and PS3 - Black</a>. Just spend the money on a high quality item and don't waste your money buying multiple cheaper headsets that you will ditch in search of a decent one.

I rate this product 1 star = I Hate It.

1252,1,"Well, first of all, I have to give this game a VERY low rating, because it seems to ME, you have to use the money cheat JUST TO GET STARTED in the game. Otherwise, you will wind up not even having enough money to house the inmates.

Secondly, all this game consists of is pretty much waiting for the next parole period to come up so you can decide who stays, and who gets out (based on length of time inmate has been there, how many rehabilitation projects he's completed, how many fights he's been in, and what, if any, gang affiliations he has). There's really nothing you can do about the fighting that goes on in this game between inmates. I have yet to see a guard break up a fight. So to me this game is just long and boring.

The graphics, in my opinion, ARE kinda cute, but not $20 worth."
1253,1,"its a toybox for graphic designers to kill some time.

I could see this finding a spot in elementary/middle school classrooms....it borders on being fun but is really, absolutely not scientifically related to evolution beyond a child's understanding...and it has all of the gameplay of about 5 free flash games with tons of expensive graphic design.

NOT WORTH THE MONEY...get the free creature creator if you wanna stretch your artistic creativity."
1254,1,"If this game allowed you to use a USB mouse and keyboard, it would probably be quite fun.  As it is, the console control setup is terrible.  It is very hard to successfully move and select troops, and it is nearly impossible to group them.  I give this zero stars.  I bought it used for $10, and I still consider it to have been a waste of money."
1255,1,TRASH. more of the same. if you want to have fun buy Titanfall2. it smashes this fool game into fairy dust.
1256,1,it only work for 1hour than it stop working do not buy this cable for the ps4 safe your money
1257,1,"How long did it take the studios to catch-up to COD4 PC users? Theyve had AI Bots and Castle maps for years! Sure the Stonehaven Castle map is a long needed breath of fresh air from freight yards, slums, and destroyed towns. But COD4 mp-burg is far superior with its battlements and tunnels. Youre not kidding anyone here studios, we know the creative talent has long left the building...

So I ask this of the Infinity Ward / Treyarch guys: Why not be brave and set the next game somewhere new? How about China ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Dont like that idea? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Dont like any of those? Then how about Japan or Dubai? Either way folks, treat yourselves to a little world travel, you definitely have the resources. But please no more Ghosts of Christmas Past"
1258,1,"I LOOVED MW1. I have been playing it non-stop online since I bought it (of course I beat the single player). When MW2 was anounced I was so happy. Got it day of release, shame on me for not reading the preview buzz. It seems the game is completely gimped and broken on the PC. The multiplayer experience, as PC gamers are used to, is completely gone. Still a great single player game, however it was way shorter than the first game. Wait for a patch to fix the server issue, till then, avoid."
1259,1,"Don't buy this game, it some how managed to get even worse then it has been in previous years. It blows my mind that EA can put this same game out every year with no improvements and charge 60 dollars for it."
1260,1,I never liked club penguin but I was given this game and it sucks all you do is look around and tap on stuff and play minigames that's the whole game so enjoy this terrible game I mean don't buy this game it is linear and no fund what so ever and uninteresting but if you're a big fan of club penguin I still don't recommend this game to anyone so don't get anything cp related
1261,1,Game is taylord to children. Game controls are simple and that's where the problem is. The combat system is all to simple no skill based assets what so ever. Just a really basic hack n slash. Its pretty much a grind fest on higher difficulties just need to triump the enemy by being a higher level. If you want a combat system that rewards you for skill then look somewhere else. At most you just press attack and the character attacks
1262,1,"I deally don't understand the hype about this game. I know GTA V and this are totally different, but GTA V blows this game by a bunch. Don't waste $60 on this."
1263,1,"I wish I could tell you something good about this software but unfortunately I can't. Don't waste time, couldn't use even the joystick with this failure game!"
1264,1,Not very well written
1265,1,"I download it and it regures downloading more stuff and registration and online connection... too much trouble and they don't tell you all that before you download ""game"" which is just registration application...."
1266,1,Does not work
1267,1,"This is only a rumble if you are under 8 years old, otherwise it's ...tremble that is not worth the money or the AA batteries that you need for it. The Rumble Pack fits into the slot of your N64 controller, and then a save pack fits into the Rumble Pack, making the controller quite heavy! There are two settings for the pack, low and high. Another annoying part of the pack is that there are two modes, one to turn the Rumble Pack on, and the other to work your gamepack to save games. Its just a hassle, and the only games that really use it are Zelda when you are fishing and sporting games, so you can feel the action."
1268,1,"Can't adjust the fit, it is really uncomfortable
also it is said to have 100 feet of range but signal gets lost when I walked from third to second floor, and the worst part is when signal is lost it makes a really annoying beep sound and beep again when it reconnects so it would beep again and again and again.....
really nice design tho....lol"
1269,1,"5 worlds a world with about 6 minigames in each. That's about 30 or so
(some don't have bonus mini-games- and I'm not reloading my game to double check the exact number) minigames and over half of them being the same as the ones in the previous levels. And before you go to the last world, you have to complete the mini-games in the current, or all previous worlds (I can't remember) 3 times each. There are 4 main mini-games that repeat, and then 1 or 2 bonuses that very slightly or a lot from other bonuses. The main mini-games all have automatical scrolling, and you are either in a maze in a jet/tank that shoots, or in a jeep/robot that jumps/flips to avoid holes/enemies. This game is a side-scroller outside of the mini-games, and there are no levels other than mini-games. There is a half way point in each world where you do a special task of playing tug or grating ice. I admit that the sheep minigames were at least fun (who wouldn't enjoy using a jet to shoot sheep or toasting sheep while a timer is running). You can win cards, which is pointless, by playing spin the wheel, etc. You can't win all the cards unless you also have crash or a link."
1270,1,"This is an awesome charger when it work, one side died after 6 months of normal usage, very disappointing! Amazon decided to replace the item, 5 stars for Amazon, 1 star for the product! Rubbish item!"
1271,1,this was another one of those stupid games. hated it would not reccommend to anyone. It had no storyline. who wants to play a game with no storyline?>
1272,1,These have been opened then sealed by third party not from manufacturer.
1273,1,It was flat out horrible it would stop working five minutes into the game after it was guaranteed to work
1274,1,"The core of the game seems ultimately fun and enjoyable, however this is currently clouded by game-breaking experiences such as an infestation of hackers and bot players. The game is playable, but not enjoyable, and the lack of a response from Bethesda has left the player base feeling ignored.

This might be a great game someday, if we still care."
1275,1,"I played Diablo 3 for around a week. I got all 5 classes past act 3; my best 2 characters (monk and witch doctor) got through normal difficulty.

=====  VISUAL  =====
The art style was cool to look at; it is one of the few 3d hash-and-slashes that I know of to go with a dark atmosphere, and the rocks in act 2 (desert, with black pointed rocks) were very stylish. I even got as far as to think that if the game keeps up the good artwork, it would be worthwhile to buy this game just to watch the artwork. But getting to act 3 (snow) and seeing the same rocks colored differently sunk all of my fantasies about the game's aesthetic value. The images are also a bit grainy; my guess is that the graininess is because Blizzard began designing the game around a decade ago, before we had today's screen resolution. The art style of acts 1 and 2 is about the only pro about the game.

=====  SERVER  =====
Given all of the connection issues (sometimes you can't connect), Error 3006 login issues (sometimes you connect, log in, and fall 1 step short of accessing your characters), and boss fight disconnects (sometimes you get disconnected during boss fights and reconnect as a corpse) already flooding the forums, I do not have much to say much about the server. (yes, Blizzard put me through all of them) The only things I have to add are:

1. While I was fighting solo to the final boss, I saw the message ""server will be down for maintenance in 15 minutes."" Just imagine that you fought so hard to finish the game, and failed because your SINGLE PLAYER server went down for maintenance!

2. I'm taking my time writing this review because Blizzard's server is down. Again.

=====  DIALOGUE  =====
You would think that, with all the time Blizzard invested into making Diablo 3, they will have plenty of time to polish the conversations. But instead, it seems that Blizzard ran out of audio/scripting funds from their long years of inactivity and had to cut the dialogue bank short. For most of the dialogues (including all of the quest dialogues), you have 1 set of NPC dialogues that fits all 5 classes, and each class works his/her dialogues around the NPCs'. The conversations are ok at times, but other times, it just feels like nobody's paying much attention to what the hero says. For example, take the following conversation between the Zoltun Kulle (a ghost) and your character:

If you play monk, you get:
Kulle: The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away. They must have been very angry with me.
Monk: They couldn't kill you. What else can they do?
Kulle: They were never very creative. (me: yeah, that sort of makes sense to me. So they aren't very creative about how to get rid of Kulle.)

And if you play witch doctor, you get:
Kulle: The Horadrim did all this to lock my body away. They must have been very angry with me.
Witch doctor: Are you surprised? Few people take betrayal lightly.
Kulle: They were never very creative. (me: huh?? what does taking betrayal harshly have to do with creativity? Kulle, ignoring me is not cool!)

=====  GAMEPLAY  =====
This is actually the biggest issue I have about the game. Diablo 3's enemy attacks for normal is divided into 2 categories: scratches... err...no, gentle touches, and nukes. And around 90% of the latter take the form of an unmoving circle that explodes after 1-2 seconds.

So gameplay (at least for normal) basically goes like this: you run around, squashing everything in your path, and getting blown into pieces because a few enemies cast circles under your feet. This is especially frustrating in acts 3 and 4, when even a type of normal minion can throw these attacks. It feels like the monster designers ran out of ideas and decided to throw bright circles in every act, hoping to get away with ""we're testing our players' reflex!""

=====  IS IT WORTH IT?  =====
Overall, I'm glad I got this game for $35. Is it worth it? No. It's worth $10 at best. But it's better than the pre-order price of $60. And it's one of those games which has such an epic predecessor that I simply had to try it despite its accumulative 2-stars. But after Diablo 3 leeched Diablo 2 of its fan base, I will be a lot less tempted to buy Diablo 4 should Blizzard decide to make it.
For those who wonder why I still put up with this, it's because I already invested $35 into it. And because I want to see if anything changes during late game (though I seriously doubt things will change)."
1276,1,"First of all I would like to know,just why in the hell is Kyle Reese on the cover of this game?? I swear to God,the very first time I've ever seen this game in the video store back in the day,I could have swore that this was based off a movie and Michael Biehn was the lead character. Anyway,that aside..this game is an absolute and total nightmare!! Even Hideo Kojima himself,was ashamed of this monstrosity. This version was NOT how Kojima originally intended the game to be!! The gameplay is absolutley awful and the punishing difficulty,shows NO MERCY on you!! The graphics,music and sound effects are promising,but the horrid gameplay,the extreme hardness and the crappy controls,completely put those to none effect whatsoever. Overall,if you wanna enjoy the original ""Metal Gear"",how it was meant to be..then I recommend picking up ""Metal Gear Solid 3:Substance"" for PS2 instead,which includes the REAL original ""Metal Gear"",and not this lackluster insult to such a great iconic video game!!"
1277,1,"2 to 5 player game? Seriously? Nintendo can't do that! Why would they make such an awesome game a 2 to 5 player game? I mean it's all this ""Well, lets make this level long"" and ""Lets make a 2 to 5 player game"" but I can't believe it!"
1278,1,"I have had this controller for only a few months and today I was switching battery packs and it wasn't working. Despite the fact that it never fell or was thrown or mishandled in anyway, there is a crack at the bottom of the area that holds the battery pack. This bottom area seems less thick than the one on the black xbox controller I have had for over a year and a half with no problems. Really upset and disappointed because it is a beautiful controller. Buyer beware."
1279,1,"first off, you have to have some sort of silly windows authentication or windows live account to even get the thing to install. When i went through all that it still freezes on launch for me. I've been through all the support info on forums and tried everything I could think of. I loved the 360 version of the game and really wanted to play it on pc since i sold my xbox. No dice. I'm a professional IT guy and a gamer to boot and it took me 2 hours to get it installed and another 2-3 days trying to get it to launch before I gave up. I hear even if you get it to work the save game data blows up after a few days anyway. This game on pc in it's current incarnation is not worth the plastic it's printed on."
1280,1,ICK
1281,1,"THIS IS NOT A VIDEO GAME, first of all.  And to make matters worse, EA didn't even bother to get permission from the NFL owners, so the names of the owners on this game are fictitious.  Stupid.  THAT'S NOT EVEN BILL COWER ON THE COVER!  It's a cheap imposter...that right there should tell you something...

Just another attempt by EA Games to squeeze a few more dollars out of the saps who are crazy about football.  I borrowed this game from a friend over the summer, waiting for NCAA 07 to come out, AND I'M SO GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT!

It's alot of reading, alot of negotiating, and a whole lot of nothing else.  If you like calling plays, but not actually running them yourself, you might like this.  If you like to spend the whole evening trying to pry T.O. away from another team to be you starting wide out, you might like this.  BUT IF YOU JUST WANT TO TURN ON YOUR PS2 AND PLAY A DAMN FOOTBALL GAME STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS DUMB ""GAME"" AS POSSIBLE.

WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE.  I'd give it ZERO STARS if I could, and I love football games."
1282,1,"This has got to be the worst game I have ever played. They used false advertising. It said Shooter as the genre. YOU DONT EVEN AIM OR SHOOT THE GUN. You tell the 8 soldiers you control to shoot the bad guys but they cant even aim good and they don't shoot unless you tell them to. Even if they are going to die they don't shoot. You cant even walk around you tell the soldiers where to go. Also on the box it says its based on a army training thing. I thought it would be a action packed shooter because thats what it looked like on the box, but I was wrong. There is no action at all, you just move around while you see a couple bad guys who just wound half your guys. I rented this game from Blockbuster, went home and put it in my PS2, played it for 25 minutes then brought it back to Blockbuster. If all US army soldiers trained on something like this the US army would be the worst army in the world."
1283,1,"After my first xbox 360 died and was not covered by MSwarrenty........  I gave in and bought an elite with the new falcon chip.  (only because I have alot of money invested in games and accessories.  I also wanted to finish assassins creed).  Hopfully this one will last longer.

For all you fools out there singing praises to this new falcon chip .......Its too early to tell if it will hold up over time considering its only been out for a few months.

I love the xbox 360 but will give one star because I had to buy two and have to pay extra for for an Elite with a chance it has increased reliability."
1284,1,"I have been a long time fan of Harvest Moon. I was as excited as everyone else about this game and was also just as disappointed. Everything about this as just terribly wrong. The camera view is awful and the entire digging and all of that nonsense was just confusing, awkward, and often left me dizzy. If you like Minecraft or games like that then you would like this game. It really is a knockoff of Minecraft and a major disappointment for those that are used to the Harvest Moon series. It really doesn't even have a slightly interesting story line to it and is just boring. Won't be buying anymore Minecraft themed Harvest Moon games after this mistake."
1285,1,Diffrent game.
1286,1,"I think this game would have been a lot of fun. But I got part way through, then saved what I had, and went to bed. When I went to continue playing, it said I had a game COPY, and would not let me play any further.

If you read page 3 of the Dracula booklet, it clearly states that some computers have this problem with this game!!!!!!!!!!!!

But I had to open the box to read page 3. So I have a game that I cannot play."
1287,1,"Bethseda took the fallout series and bent it over. The endings are garbage. It has 200+ endings.... They are merely a different picture. Not like the original Fallouts where it would tell you what effect your actions would have on the wasteland. The main story is a little tacky and short. You can skip most of it and jump to the middle of the story line which makes it evem shorter. Bottom line, save your money for a game that has not been molested."
1288,1,"I'm not even gonna waste my time writing a review for this piece of zhit of a game. It's a completely revamped game copying ""some"" of the elements of diablo 2 and alter it to make the game ""innovative"". Well innovative my ass, the only innovation blizzard did was masterfully lure players to pay 60$ with their humongous chain of ads, and included that idiotic RMAH to get more money. Thank God that RMAH actually ruined the game so I don't have to vitch and vitch since the game will slowly die by itself.

End-game is non existent, except you want to sit all day developing some cool ways to invent a new macro that will allow you to grind repetitively by using one button (and its bannable too apparently). Ironic isn't it, they designed the game to be repetitive, yet when we make our lives easier they have every right to pull the plug.

Blizzard will never be the same company they used to be during the diablo 2 days. They're here, they're big, they're cool and their goal is to rip you off selling zhit that you won't touch for the rest of your life. Read the comments with 1-3 star, trust me I didn't believe the game was such a failure either until I tried it myself.

Played diablo 2 for 7 years and quit for dota. Played diablo 3 for 2 months, quit after realizing wtf have these morons developed for 6 years??"
1289,1,"so i bought this product a few months back, i was thinking ""oh wow, 3600 mah's, i cant pass this up!"", i was dead wrong, i don't know what system they use in japan or wherever this was made, but it IS NOT 3600 mah!, i figure its abt half of that, which would mean MAYBE 1800, i tested it out and it has exactly the same play time as the PSP 1000 stock battery, i know it was only 3 bucks, but id rather have that 3 dollars than a fake battery, i read online and found these babies can even explode if you over charge them, the real sony batteries cut the current when the charge is full, but this one will still allow more power, sounds dangerous to me. DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY FOLKS! just spend the 22 or so dollars it is for the real sony battery, at least you won't feel ripped off and violated!"
1290,1,"This is a 2K14 copy and paste with out a showcase mode. There are no new features like in crowd fighting, new taunting positions, or revamped ladder matches. This garbage literally just removed showcase and put nothing in it's place."
1291,1,"While this game was colorful and pretty easy I stopped playing it about the time  your party ends up going to the king and the king 'checks out' the female in the party. The screen focuses on her bust area and her bottom area . There are other comments up to this point that are inappropriate for children and teens . I just thought ""Really?"" Dissapointed since this was the first dragon quest that I had ever played even though I often saw them on the SNES in Japan. I sold my copy."
1292,1,"Game does not work. Every time you go ""exhibition"" the game stops. Also the disk is so scratched and useless I don't even know what happened. It worked the first day but hasn't worked since. Next time you are trying to sell something try to figure out it's useful."
1293,1,Dont buy this its terrible the battery charging cable sucks and the battery only works for a limited time
1294,1,"The Last Guardian is a mess. Trico is at times difficult to control, he takes a while to obey and do what he is supposed to. The game suffers from frame rate drops under 30 fps on the PS4 Pro sometimes, its probably way worse on the original PS4. The controls are super laggy, floaty, janky and unresponsive, it is unacceptable for a game to have such poor controls in 2016. I regret buying this game for full price on PSN but if I can help someone save their money, that's still better than nothing. Shame on Sony for releasing this game in its current state. Avoid."
1295,1,Noise
1296,1,"Being in the military I was disappointed with the requirement to have access to Broadband to play the game. This game is simply unplayable in a deployed location and in many overseas bases there are regional issues that make playing with co-workers impossible.

If you are in the military I strongly suggest that you do NOT buy this game. Blizzard refuses to add in support for LAN which is what most military members use in deployed locations to play these types of games.

Shame on you Blizzard for not allowing deployed military members able to play your game!"
1297,1,"Well, I didn't want a Tv in my room because my new computer has the ability to play live Tv and It would take up too much space, so I ordered this item in hopes of playing my Wii, ps2, and nintendo 64 on my monitor. BUT it didn't have the right cord that plugs into my computer and was unable to use it so I returned it. DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HDMI CABLE INPUT IN YOUR COMPUTER!!!"
1298,1,This is weak sauce. This should have included a better game. No wonder they gave this game away for free. I regret buying this bundle. I quickly sent this back as soon as I played it.
1299,1,"This game sucks, seriously what was Nintendo thinking?"
1300,1,"Bought this for my wife since we game together a lot and she's never had a half-descent headset. I guess she still doesn't have one since when it showed up and we plugged it in, the left speaker we completely dead. No sound from the left side. Mic worked ok, was quite but perhaps we just need to adjust programs/mic settings to boost it. That half the product doesn't work though is unacceptable. We already through away the box it came with though so I don't think they'll take it back at this point, plus they usually make you pay for return shipping anyways so just marking it off as a failed purchase and moving on. My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE."
1301,1,This was the worst game I ever played! it was hard to figure out at first and even when I changed locations  didn't seem to do much.
1302,1,Rather go to Walmart and pay 3 dollars  not 12
1303,1,"I realized it was going to be a ""movie"" based game, so it wouldn't be up to par to it's stand alone counterparts, but the garbage this game has delivered.. wowed me.

- Single player is not exactly short, but not long either.. For the low quality of the game, I found it to be too long, but just because I wanted to be done and over with this game..
- Graphics quality.. oy, where do I start... there isn't any quality. in some areas textures are overlapping each other, the boundaries of textures are often expanding over the visual border (so you cannot shoot ouf of the corner, or walk close to it, or toss a grenade.. you WILL get stuck)
- Multiplayer could be fun if the graphics and programming was done right, and they figured out how to prevent lag..

All in all, this game would be ok, if it was priced at 10-15$, but if you want to spend money on a good game, this one isn't what you are looking for."
1304,1,"I want to love this system, but after two weeks with hours of time with support this system is highly flawed against families.  My kids still can't play games (even on games rated E for everyone it is giving a content lock).  Adding accounts is filled with error codes (haven't been able to add any, only download).  The guide for adding family doesn't work because the first thing it tells you to do has an error (in the system location).  For everything this console is supposed to be, it shouldn't have made the account process worse (360 didn't have this many hoops).  My kids just want to play their Christmas presents and instead of relaxing on Christmas I am still stuck with this nightmare (they have only been able to play as guest).

I also dislike that the controllers are much harder to tell who is which player which helps a lot when you prefer to play 4 player games."
1305,1,I ordered two of these and neither one would charge either our Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL. One wouldn't work at all when plugged in and the other would work only if you held the cord with your hand in exactly the right position. I have already returned these and replaced them with the original Nintendo chargers which both work fine. You get what you pay for.
1306,1,"Way to be loyal to your fanbase that has supported you all these years capcom. This is no different than what sony did with the psp go, except this is physical media instead of dlc. Now, everyone's saying that capcom did this to destroy the used game market and in essence they have with this title in particular. However, I don't foresee them doing this with future releases because this game is different. Mercenaries is simply minigames that have no story and consist of individual levels which should still be available even after you beat the game. What I'm saying is that, they did this because they knew people were going to buy this game and play through it a couple of times in one day and then sell it, which in turn would not leave much room for the market of new games. I'm definitely not siding with capcom on this, because it is their fault to begin with for making a game that consist of only minigames that should've been included on the upcoming revelations game. I didn't purchase this title, but was going to buy it used in a few weeks, however, I'm never buying this and will probably never buy another capcom title again. It's shameful business tactics like this that eventually lead to the demise of good companies. Greed is for now, but disloyalty is forever!"
1307,1,"The EA servers are completely offline for this classic PC game, so it is virtually useless now :("
1308,1,"I purchased this game for my niece since she is a huge fan of Power Puff Girls! We played this game once and were really disappointed. Why? Simply put, every single thing in it sucks like hell, from graphic, game play, music, replay value, etc. Worst of all, however, is that this game doesn't have Wi-Fi! We rather play MKDS or DKRDS! Do not buy this game. You might regret you did! I sure did at least."
1309,1,"ok before you write me off as a PlayStation fanboy, I'm not!

I own the wii, wii u, and PS3
I own every smash game except for the 3DS version.

I'm not impressed with this game, it's too similar to Brawl, and I'll be damned to buy an adapter to use a controller that's 3 generations old!

Why didn't they include story mode????
Nintendo made a huge mistake by not including it, the cinematics are lacking and gameplay is very similar to brawl.

All that aside, if this is the only system you own, then get the game, but I highly suggest purchasing Brawl first.  This game isn't worth the $59.99 price tag.

If you're like me and own multiple systems, do yourself favor and purchase PlayStation All Stars, the game is made extremely well, very good level design, nice selection of characters, great graphics, awesome sound, and easy pick up and play gameplay.

I already sold this game and will pick up this new iteration when it goes on sale.

Personally I don't like the snide attitude of the creator of this game, people save your money, the sleeper hit that's going to be Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, retailing for only $39.99"

How could the company that gave us Catacombs, Wolfenstein 3d, Doom, Doom II, Final Doom, Quake, Hexen, Hexen II and Heretic give us such garbage over the last few years like Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 4 WTF!!!, Doom 3, Heretic II and now this piece of trash.  If you want to make these games make them but don't ruin them but slapping a Quake/Doom logo on them to sell them, that only makes fans think you sold out and are now making horrid games.....which you are.  Id have served their purpose now they have been bought out, hopefully we will see some respect and dignity and most of all fun brought back to Doom, and maybe a real sequel to Quake 1."
1312,1,Supreme Commander 2 is a crappy game. Nice graphics. Nice path finding. But the story is silly and intrudes on the game. The game play has very little in common with the previous Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation games. They took Command and Conquer's game play and story mode and slapped Supreme Commander's graphics on top. I don't recommend this game unless you really really really enjoyed C&C Tiberian Wars.
1313,1,thanks to EA you have to break an arm a leg and your back in order to get Mass Effect 1 to even play on windows 7. I did tons of research only downloaded patches got new game codes everything you could imagine never got it to work. if you don't believe just google mass effect 1 install not working. you will see tons of forums still not answered to this day. Buy ME2 or ME3 but don't bother with ME1 just buy for xbox or ps
1314,1,Pile of absolute garbage. I despise Nintendo for this kind of crap everything they design breaks inside a week.

1316,1,"This game is ridiculously clunky and s***ty. It looked rather cool, videos and pics really drew me in. Cinematic are garbage, usually a aperture of a game that a creator tries too hard on and u wish they tried more on thr story. However it all just sucks. A cinematic cuts out beofre it seems like it should leaving question and uncertainty and to what is happening in this story that you already know nothing about. I've spent hours aimlessly wandering around looking for the first person who is supposedly going to die if I don't find him..im pretty sure he's freaking dead. There's no direction. As to where you need to go. Just ""find this guy"". Which makes me wonder if I'm even going the right way or if the games just letting me wander around stupidly.
game play isn't horrible, it can respond how it should, but I haven't seen my enemies be a staggred much at all even though the game claims I could. Making a character class seems pointless as the character can be adjusted to fit whatever play style you want. Sooo it's a useless setup.
to add to the frustration of the game just overall sucking. The voice is completely off in every scene my character attempts to speak. Basically he screams in pain, and a few seconds later thr act that caused pain happens, or the other way around and it has happened and then he's screaming about being hit.. don't give this company your money the games trash and they should've released updates to have at least fkn solidified the game to be enjoyable to play. But no."

1323,1,"The third Adventure Company game based on an Agatha Christie novel, Evil Under the Sun is disappointing evidence that this series - never great to begin with - is actually getting worse over time.

Puzzles are few and far between, and nearly all of them are simple inventory puzzles. As with the previous games, you just pick up anything the game will allow you to take, and tote it around, ridiculously, until you eventually have need of it. In a couple of cases the game even gives you detailed instructions for how to solve a puzzle. If you think that following instructions (complete with diagrams) is a lot of fun, well, this is the game for you.

Otherwise, you can just sit back and watch Poirot walk around. There is no way to fast-travel between locations, so much of your time will be spent walking. Hopefully you'll find that very entertaining, because the pace of this game is astonishingly slow. The game is composed of eight chapters, and the murder doesn't even occur until chapter five. Until then, most of the ""action"" comes from two new storylines created for the game: a Fifth Columnist hunt (the game takes place during WWII), and a plot about a glowing green ghost that even Scooby Doo would find silly. And don't even think about skipping any dialogue - if you don't painstakingly work your way through the dialogue tree, you're likely to get stuck.

But far and away, my biggest gripe with this game is the ""new ending."" Do not be fooled by this - the murderer is the same as in the novel!  Apparently the ""new"" part comes from the, um, action scene that follows (in cut scene, of course, because heaven forbid the player have to do anything during the climax of the game). The new ending doesn't even make much sense, really, but I was so happy to see the game end that I won't nitpick.

Bottom line: this game is a joyless, plodding exercise that never would have been made if not for the Christie name. Read the book instead. If you're looking for a good detective game, check out the Nancy Drew series. Honestly, you could just watch paint dry and it would still be more fun than this game."
1324,1,"I got this game from gamestop and woaa big disappointment, poor development like the one that came, out few years ago. I can't believe i fall for this again."
1325,1,"This game is an example of everything that has ruined games for me since the early 90's. No pause, no manual save, no map, and even though it's classified as an rpg the character doesn't level up by defeating enemies, nor can they sell items they collect, neither can they gather information on where to go and what to do by speaking to other characters. Strangely, this is not what ruined the game for me. It was the arbitrary soul tendency system, which IS the most cryptic pile of nonsense I have ever run across in a game. I got to hand it to the people who marketed Demon's Souls, they decide to call it an old school hardcore gaming experience, and critics and gamers buy it. That's the reason I bought it. But those old games were hard because of a lack of game testing or technological limitations. This game was probably not tested very much, or at all. It would go a long way in explaining the shizbomb story, and lack of character development. If they can make a game this lazily, call it old school or hardcore, and have the critics and gamers eat it up, I'm going to find it very difficult to trust reviews by others. I would also like to add that I destroyed the game disc, then threw it in the trash. It's home now. I should also add that I beat this sucker. I've beaten many games of this sort, and I always feel the same, that the experience is akin to having teeth pulled sans novocaine. Yeah, it makes you hardcore, but afterwards you won't be smiling much, and you just might deck the doc!"

Think I will send it to the guy who does Will It Blend?"
1327,1,EA has got a lot of nerve when it comes to customer support. How have they not made this compatable with Windows 8? Are they just abandoning their fans of this franchise? Didn't like the Sims 3 Either. But that is another story. I'll stick with the Sims 2.
1328,1,"I've had the pleasure of owning one of these controllers in the past. It's a fake, it does a real good job at looking like the real thing. The controller does hold up for light games but breaks down in games that require some pin point stress. Y button broke down fast, A button got stuck, R button became unresponsive. I got it for 10 dollars and it wasn't even worth that, it lasted less than a week. As other reviewers said, it's cheap plastic. As for even opening the product, I didn't bother, but the original gamecube remotes require a tri-head screwdriver, same one that is needed to open a DS. It's something that has to be specially ordered to fix or modify their products.

Seriously there are so many people bailing on this game that by the time you level a toon to 50 they will already be merging servers.  I have had 5 friends get there accounts baned only to have no response from customer support for the reason why and no ability to contact the aion GM's (if such a person exists) that the guild of 50 that I was in is down to 10 for people who have gone back to playing console games because of the incredible lack of caring on the part of the Aion team for their customer base. not to mention how retarded it is to try and level once you hit 30 because you are constantly getting killed by people 10-20 levels above you, that's right...there is pretty much no safe place to level up after level 25.  You might as well wait until an actual MMORPG comes out instead of a mess like this.  And yes I am bitter, I put all that time in getting a toon to lvl 50 to just have it banned with no given reason and no ability to get in touch with someone who can help me after 2 weeks; and what is more insane is that this is not a rare thing that is happening."

1348,1,"Two Worlds 2  or (TW2)has some improvements over the first one, but the improvements all have their pitfall which makes the game feel like rubbish.

Although the graphics have been revamped the environments and everything in the game world looks blurry and out of focus regardless of the HD or regular tv you may have. The draw-in distance is not very good either with lots of pop-ins and graphical glitches like a characters leg showing through solid objects (clipping).

There are also sound glitches which cut off an on abruptly at times. The music which is rather good, is very short and loops back endlessly, except that it doesn't have any musical transitions if it restarts again.

Voice acting is certainly better for the most part, but the character you control sounds like a sleezy porn star with a raspy voice.

The controls and in responsiveness of the character on screen is sluggish, you mash buttons wildly and see your character swinging the weapons in a limp fashion. Which brings be to the combat gameplay.

One button can be used to block attacks but it feels sluggish and unresponsive at times. You can dual wield weapons but the techniques look goofy and ineffective. You cannot lock-on to enemies during melee combat so a lot of times when you thought you had a solid hit, you actually end up slashing nothing.

The character animations still look sloppy, and they still move a bit stiff. The animations in Two World 2 lack the fluidity or any life-like movements found in many other open world RPGs.

Probably the only thing I really enjoyed in Two Worlds 2, is the crafting system which allowed me to create or repair weapons and clothing and magic spells. Also Liked how it allowed me to ""dismantle"" items and break them down into core elements such as metals, fabrics or potions.

The story was lackluster and tries to rip off the better Fable games. In TW2 main quest you have to rescue your sister from the evil Gandahar (incorrect spelling sorry). After the the boring and sloppy combat, blurry graphics and long list of glitches, I didn't care for TW2. The fanboys can attack me all they want but It won't change the facts that this tries to be a good RPG but fails on many fronts.

The first game sucked bad and I had high hopes that the improvements to this sequel would make me enjoy the game.
But this the second attempt which SouthPeak, and the developers fail to bring a good title. TW2 should be the final nail to coffin and hopefully this game gets buried or sold in the bargain bin.

Pros:
+multi-player game modes
+crafting system is easy and fun to use
+open world gameplay

Cons:

-glitches galore
-music and sound cuts off
-some of the voice-overs still suck
-blurry graphics
-sloppy controls
-sluggish response
-goofy animations
-goofy looking combat
-no lock on system
-navigation on maps an compass is not easy
-interface takes a while to get used to
-lacks intensity in action

If you liked this game you might also like Oblivion, Mass Effect or Fable series."
1349,1,"Well kids, I just returned the Xbox One my wife bought me after only a week of ownership. With the One being my first gaming console since the original Xbox I was in for a big shock.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me. I'm not standing for it so back to the store the Xbox went"
1350,1,"No physical damage. my son was very careful with it and the mic just quit. I realized they had a two year warranty. I contacted them and they agreed to exchange them, at my cost. It cost me $9.32 to return them. Plus the $7.43 for a 3 year warranty that lasted 3 months and won't carry over to the replacement ones. That is a pretty big chunck on a cheaper set of headphones. I am done with Turtle Beach products."
1351,1,"I recently purchased this console for my nephew and it's already collecting dust in the shadow of his Xbox 360.  This product feels rushed to market with so many cut corners that basic amenities modern gamers have become accustomed to are nowhere to be seen.

The OS is slow, poorly laid out and filled with all sorts of hurdles and 15-20 second loading screens every time you want to explore ANYTHING with it.

After enduring the painfully slow day 1 mega-patch on Nintendo's anemic servers and installing all sorts of additional patches to make the system work as advertised, I found it to be highly underwhelming.

Hulu+ causes the system to periodically lock-up completely (requiring a hard reset - unplugging it and then plugging it back in), the F-Zero mini-game that came bundled with the Nintendoland title constantly causes the system to prompt the user with a controller re-configuration while pausing the game (I believe this is due to the user's hands covering up the IR emitter on the top of the controller - something difficult to NOT cover up when instructed to hold the controller sideways) and the other titles just don't really feel like anything more than old Wii games with an up-scaled resolution.  Compatibility is still an issue as well.  The ""Pro Controller"" (the Xbox 360 controller-like peripheral for the Wii-U) isn't even supported by games like New Super Mario Bros. U!  The shared sound between the Wii U controller and the TV is disorientating and annoying (not to mention, it nullifies any advanced sound system many home theatres use).

This console doesn't offer anything that hasn't already been available for many years (with time to be refined and improved -- something Nintendo has failed to do with any of their software/hardware).

As someone that has been a Nintendo fan since the original Famicom/NES, it pains me to give such a harsh criticism to the company that helped dig the video games industry out of a New Mexican landfill.  Nintendo is banking on the nostalgia factor and, sadly, the gamers in this household don't live in the past (where this console belongs).  Save your money and either hold off for the truly ""Next Gen"" hardware rolling out next year or wait for something worth purchasing from Nintendo's game catalogue."
1352,1,"The key bad points in this game are:
1:Way too much grinding and farming
2:semi decent graphics just slightly better than ps2
3:boring music but just below average
4:It has some nice armor and weapons textures but not much differences between them expect new armor and weapons may look worst than what your wearing and it takes too long to make them in the item creation, to make all of them could take over a year of boring grind/farming. Possibly over 900-3000 hours of gameplay is a big turn off for me.

If you go online to the game servers its a scam, the amount of time consumed when playing online is ridiculous the farming is hard the amount of rewards are rare and if you go on DLC psn network you know why, all the DLC combined is over 100 $150+ buy this and that such as increased drop rates, and have it lasts for 30 days only, a lot of the best gaming is supposed to be done online but at a high price, the game is a 2/5 at best such a game should not be so hard to play online with all that grinding, You've been warned its a serious grind game just as bad as world of warcraft, I'm a hardcore gamer but this game White knight chronicles is only just okay offline. The moment i went online i was scammed out of so many hours spent and only little reward to be had. A lot of people reviewing this come from the game company themselves. Trust a real person a real gamers review, I will say this offline it has some fun to be had with it, go through a half decent storyline your main character remains silent and boring throughout the story which doesn't make sense, its very anti-climactic for all those hours u could spend creating your character is only useful online.

So when you do go online your whole world changes you have to grind and farm even more than a typical hardcore gamer is used to, I gave up playing this online as the game isn't good enough to promote such grinding and rare drop farming. Just to make your gear/outfit/armor that overall has better stats than what your wearing but lacks in style and appearance, such as I'm wearing a cool armor and weapon but I make or find something that has way better stats than what you already have on, just kills the whole point in spending hours farming and grinding to make the new piece or armor and weapon look really shabby and crap all that time spent to look more ruined in the game???

A lot of people stopped playing this game so the community online is dying, I'm sure this is because of the lack of game mechanics to keep you playing, this is what happens when you force people to spend more than 300 hours doing nothing but rare item hunting which does nothing but waste your time. Imagine this going out looking for groups to do a quest for rare monster drops, you spend some time getting a group then you all go out together when you go through the level and kill the end boss say spending 1-2 hours or more in it and the boss doesn't drop the necessary material thats needed to make a piece of armor or weapon? You catch my point in games like this thats not an MMORPG massively multi-player online rpg all boss drops should be once defeated a 100% drop rate so people can work on other pieces of gear instead of farming the same one over n over. A note to the developers this game isn't an MMORPG so don't try to emulate the grinding and farming on doing the same repetitive quests over n over.

The game is full of materials and a lot of them cost a lot of time and money to get, and the game isn't rewarding when you kill enemies you do not end up with much money at the end and mats you have to grind for a long time to get quantity of them just enough to build the next armor/weapon. The music in the game is just below average, the storyline super cliche, The graphics are just slightly better than Playstation 2 quality, the only thing thats decent is the texture of the armor and weapons, but most of them are too similar in design and only have different designs on them so really I'm going to farm 400 hours just to get another piece of armor thats worst looking has better stats than my good looking armor and weapons and with slightly different characteristics? No thank you. I completed the game and the sequel because I'm one of those hardcore gamers even though I don't like a game if i find something of small interest in it I will continue to play it till i finish it, but that damn online mode that kills out your psn wallet for little reward isn't worth it or the time spent in building the rest of your gameplay. The problem is you have to go online to get the chance to make all your weapons and armor as some quests you need help from other people to complete. Having to spend months to a year or so on one game... that to me is just super lame.

If you want a decent RPG that will last you a decent time without the process of involving a 400-500+ hours of pointless grinding/farming avoid this game at all cost trust me you will thank me.

I miss the days of Grandia, Final fantasy 6-7-8-X, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Secret of mana, Star ocean 2, Valkyrie Profile, Zelda 1, 3 and Ocarina of time just to name a few top ones there. So you guys know I'm for real a hardcore rpg fan since the release of Zelda 1 NES and even further back Heavy on the magic keyboard adventure game on the Amstrad."

Sometimes Starforce won't do any damage to your computer, it may simply state that it won't work with a generic Windows message. Other times Starforce may stop your computer from starting up correctly, resulting in headaches trying to get the computer to work again.

Beware all games with Starforce on them."
1357,1,"I am a huge Diablo fan. I love the first two games and expansion and have waited years for #3. I wish I had never bought it. Where I am located the game is unplayable. And, in this case, location does have an impact on whether or not you will be able to play Diablo. I think Blizzard underestimated the sheer volume of fans they have that live in an area where extremely fast, stable and unlimited internet is unavailable.

I have internet through mobile broadband and while it is OK for surfing it is not fast enough to play online games. I knew this before I bought the game but hoped that Diablo 3 would just use a connection to validate your character and then play as a normal game off your hard drive etc. but this was not the case. Even when playing single player the online aspect of the game is so entwined into the game itself that I was unable to play with my current internet setup.

Another problem is the lack of support for some common video cards. I understand a new game will not run on all systems and that even after a few years your PC maybe be falling slightly behind unless you upgrade but I have an Alienware for Christ's sake. It maybe be one of the cheaper models (M11X) but until Diablo 3 I had not tried to play a single game that my system would not run, this includes recent titles like Dead Island which I played with maxed out graphics for hours with no frame rate issues at all. Even when I took my PC to a location that had fast internet I was still unable to play at any more than 4-5 frames a second (with graphics and resolution all the way down) and my system is overclocked.

My video card was not only in the not recommended list but the completely unsupported list. I guess I should have researched that before hand but I never dreamed my computer would not run a game like this. I had to add a (-launch) command to the exe and change a few numbers in the instillation file to even get past the games graphic card filter to attempt to play it (there is a guide online for this). I bought my copy from Walmart which means I can not return it. It makes me mad that Blizzard would block some users from even trying to play the game they purchased especially for those of us who can not return it.

I activated a new internet service with a slightly better ping which was the best I could do in my area but was unable to log on for most of the entire day due to the servers being overloaded. Even after the launch day storm is over, and even if I could play the game, I would not appreciate having to rely on servers to play a game that I purchased.

I always loved the first two games because I could play them offline but forcing players to have an internet connection is a bad choice and I think Blizzard will lose many fans over it. The best I can do now is wait a few years until I have the money and actually need a new system since I can't upgrade the graphics card in my model and hope someone hacks it and releases a patch of sorts to allow offline play. Funny, if you think about it, the choice to force players to connect to the internet in hopes of preventing people from altering the game in anyway may promote people to do just that."

1359,1,"I read the reviews that said it wasn't a good PC port. I read the reviews that said you'd have to play with a USB console controller. I even read the reviews about it being a ""game for windows live...beware!"" But...for $8, I couldn't resist trying it for myself. Well, I've tried to play it for a few hours on multiple occassions. You can play without logging in to windows live, but you cannot save, so there isn't much point in a game of this caliber. I cannot seem to play with only the keyboard/mouse OR only the USB controller. There still seems to be some things that I still have to use the mouse or the controller for, but I cannot seem to find the way to play exclusively one or the other. I'm sure this could be changed in the key bindings, but if the default game, as loaded from start up cannot be played without a higher level knowledge of such things, I am not a hardcore enough player to do be bothered with that."
1360,1,"I was very disappointed in this game.  It looked like a fun game where you walk around in a mirror, look for keys solve puzzles and maybe use magic but no.  Instead there's a little hand on the screen that you move around.  All you do is click on stuff.  I thought you would control mickey.  I mean who the heck thought of the stupid hand clicking.  This is not how the game should have been.  Every time you do something it shows like a 2 minute movie.  DONT BUY THIS GAME.  Save your money for good games like smash bros,  Resident evil series, mario sunshine, something good."
1361,1,Was already broken when it got hear after 2 months. Do not buy!
1362,1,"i baught this game becuz everyone on here said it wld be good and fun. i liked skyrim so i thought this wld be just like it. a fun rpg that i can play on an afternoo.

dont bye this game! by this game if you enjoy wasting hours trying to kill skeltons that keep getting back up for hours, diing and running back for hourss and hourss."
1363,1,"Well, I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and was pleased to find one that was reasonably priced. However, after he tried to play with it for a few hours we discovered some of the buttons did not work. I attempted to contact the seller to make an exchange but never heard back. Luckily Amazon refunded the money. I'd give it zero stars if I could but that isn't an option."
1364,1,Good awful
1365,1,Kept diconnecting never had trouble like that with any other razer mouse if the diconnecting issue is fixed id say it would be good idk if it was the software or the mouse but i had a razer nagae 2014 and never had issues like i did with this one every 20m it would diconnect and turn off i switch to a red dragon mouse and have not had trouble sense.
1366,1,"By this point, most gamers have tried the original ""Donkey Kong"".  While not quite as iconic as Pac-Man, ""Donkey Kong"" was effectively what put Nintendo on the map in the gaming industry, and the debut of a certain ""Jump Man"", who would later be renamed Mario.  You may have heard of him.  He went on to have a pretty successful career after this game.

So what is ""Donkey Kong""?  A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man. Jump Man must avoid the barrels, jump over other obstacles, climb ladders, etc, to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of Bowser . . . er . . . Donkey Kong!

What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.

One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.

The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).

By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of ""Donkey Kong"".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).

Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"", and ""Super Mario Bros.""), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.  The Japanese ""Famicom Mini"" series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the West.

In terms of Donkey Kong, I would pick it up on the Virtual Console if you really want to play it.  Do not waste your money on the Gameboy Advance version."
1367,1,This product when you download needs an update but you can't get it sooooo you can't play it.  My Antivirus software says it is dangerous to get the download.  Don't waist you time with it.
1368,1,These are great board games but awful DS games pretty much just tap the screen. Tap Tap Tap...  Tap Tap Tap... Done.
1369,1,This is just okay.
1370,1,"They do sound ok and fit nicely.  However they fell apart while on my head twice now.  The little pieces by the head padding randomly pop off.  The headband piece is 100% plastic, I am not sure how long it will last before breaking.  I will update if it breaks.
Update 12/21/2015:
The right speaker blew while listening to music at a moderate volume (less loud than the left now with a slight scratchy noise)."
1371,1,"Can't find anything to like about this game. I only play Multiplayer.

 Like previous MOH games, tiny maps, tiny.

 No team work. No one uses VOIP. No one heals or gives ammo. Few players, fewer games. Largest percentage of hackers ever. Worse browser ever. Slow to get in a game.

 Your teammates will run away from firefights, NEVER seen that before! High rankers slaughter low rankers. Low rankers are just targets. No bullet penetration, not even a wooden box!!

 I'm jones'ing for a fps multiplayer. MOHW is not playable. But, I think this whole genre is finished. They will never get rid of the hackers, the drunks, or the idiots.

 I've been playing fps since the release of BF1942. Not one improvement in gameplay, since that day."
1372,1,this game is absolutely disgusting. DO not buy this game unless you love wasting your hard earned money. DO NOT BUY AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1373,1,"I want Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection made by Microsoft Game Studios in the U.S.

But, I think most of these games are from Ubisoft, a European company. If it is from Ubisoft, the game can be installed in English, Dutch, German and a couple other languages. If you have the necessary system requirements, the game will probably work on your computer."
1374,1,"Wheres the 3D motions? Wheres the excitement? Wheres my refund?

1380,1,wasn't for me
1381,1,Doesn't work with window 7 it keep lagging!!
1382,1,We have never been able to get this program to work. We had people that do gameing as a hobby and they could not work the game.
1383,1,This game can't reach 1080p and it has frame rate issues. I think I will wait for the pc version to release. Should have been released on ps4 so this game could reach it's full potential.
1384,1,"The manual was missing, so I start playing the game for a few days, drop it, pick it back up a couple months later, and it tells me that my trial time is up and I need the activation key, which is on the MANUAL. I guess it's to be expected, their first game was trash too. No plot, characters you don't really see or care about. The game was shaping up to be just like the first one."
1385,1,"This game has a great story.  This game is compelling and interesting, and this game is one of the most irritating games I've ever played.  Any game that relies on reflex button press sequences is just cookie cutter weak and stupid.  WB middle management people who thought this would be a good idea should be summarily fired asap.  Each fight is an irritating button press sequence.  Too many stupid combos sends this game's play back to street fighter in the 90's.  We've come a long way since then, but apparently not this game.  This game has zero replay value. If you paid more than $5.00 for this game you wasted your money.  I haven't even mentioned the complete lack of sound track music.  For a game about sound, this game has the bar none WORST sound of any game I've ever played.  I suppose it is supposed to be evil and disturbing, but I hate to inform the game developers, static and poor recording hiss is NOT evil and disturbing, its irritating and stupid.

It has been a long time since I've actually become angry at how bad a game is.  This game shoots to the top of my list of most horrible games.  I think the worst thing about it is the arbitrarily stupid limitations on what you can do.  Like for example; at one point you are fighting a boss that's hurting you with an area of effect weapon, and you walked up some steps to get close enough to the AOE.  When the boss actually attacks, there is nothing apparent stopping you from just backing down the steps and reassessing the situation, but no, that would actually make sense so you can't do it.  Later after the boss is defeated you jump down out of the area in a cut scene, something you couldn't do before that.  This kind of physics neglect is one of the worst offenses of the ""Cut scene"" programmer games like this one.  The whole game is just a linear series of scenes and fights strung together with reflex button press sequences.  It completely offends me.  I'm guessing this type of game has become popular as movie people try and get into the game business.  They desire to have the player play through a movie they've written, and so the forced scripting of your actions drives you through it.  This has got to be the worst playing experience I've ever had.  People who make games like this, take a look at half life, portal, half life 2 etc.  These sublime games deliver the awesome story without forced action.

This game is the new Worst Game EVER!"
1386,1,what the hell? i thought this game would be like rainbow 6 or something but jeez man this is terrible all you do is bark out orders and watch the comp play... awful man i cant believe it
1387,1,"The PC port is so buggy you can't play it.  It stops at one point and that's it.  None of the posted fixes work.
Don't buy it."
1388,1,"Don't get this, like please don't get this i open xbox 360 controllers all the time to fix problems with them but this is not worth your money. the design at first looks really cool and all but when you try to size it up and switch it over to this case it barely fits. When i first bought this and got it in the mail I didn't even get all the parts I was missing about 8 pieces of the product (screws and main buttons). I contacted them and then waited for about a week and a half to get the pieces I needed to actually put it together. Even eith all th pieces it doesn't really fit. I would never get this again and will not recommend this to anyone who is thinking on buying this, there are others companys that will give you a better and more fitting product."
1389,1,"I did not purchase this game. I was a BETA tester. The game isn't bad. Pretty much ""more of the same"" with little new in the way of features. Missing the humor and overall vibe you expect with the Red Alert series. I would still purchase the game if not for the DRM scheme. EA, learn your lesson. This is not going to be a successful model. Go back to Westwood values."
1390,1,"The last star wars movie was incredible and I was looking foward to the game.  I borrowed it from my uncle and I was really excited.  When I played it it was like an earthquake hit the designers' heads.  The graphics are awful and looks like it came out of the garbage.  The game gets really repeditive after the second level.  There is no originality at all in this game which is really bad. Sure the multiplayer might be pretty good but it also gets repeditive just like the single player.  On the bonus stages you get to play as different characters, but they all handle the same way.  The controls are pretty good but you won't need them because all you use is the X button.  Overall the game is horrible."
1391,1,Thanks for making me buy an attachment to play the game nintendo.
1392,1,"Yeah, we've all seen the commerical, ""while all those pretty little actors are sitting in their trailers, being pampered, and fond over, the stuntmen are out having all the frickin' fun"". Just that line makes you want to go over to Circuit City and buy this game. STOP! DO NOT DO THAT! This game is a horrible waist. Truly an awesome video game idea, but it could've been brought to life on a totally different approach.
The first level starts off with a few simple tasks. Or so they seem. You complete the first task, ""hey, no problem, I've got this nailed"", then, almost immediatly, the director shouts out another task you have to do usaully within 5-10 seconds. Despite how terribly hard, annoying, and frustrating it is, I just have to wonder how the makers thought this would be fun? I mean, completing task after task after task. Now, in games like Grand Theft Auto, the whole task thing's fun. You can actully get out the car and do other things, but not in this game! You are strictly stuck onto one direct path for each level, and there is no time for rest. As I said before, all it is is do this, do that, do this, you failed, do it again, time up, restart level, do this, do that, do this, do that, do this, you failed, start over..."".
Please, spare yourself and rent it first. My friend and I both rented it and didn't even want to play it more than once. The first time we played was for about 2 hours (2 hours I could have been sleeping), and in that whole time, we did not even pass the first level. Now, to end this review, I'll be as frank as possibly: this game [is a mediocre piece of gaming]."
1393,1,"I love wii boxing and thought this game looked fun when I bought it. I should have looked at the Amazon reviews prior but I was at a store and excited to play it.

Complete waste of money.  You'd have more fun watching your $14.99 swirling around in the toilet bowl when you flushed it."
1394,1,"Terrible product, it worked 20 minutes and then it never worked again, it does not even turn on at all. And for those 20 minutes it did not work well either, I tried to play Rock Band but it was impossible.
Terrible cheap quality"
1395,1,"worst controller ever

i usually do detail here but just don't buy it, it doesn't work right"
1396,1,You must boot with the included software *every* time you want to play a game.  That [stinks].  Do not buy it because the lower price and additional memory are not worth the extra hassle!
1397,1,"Pac-Man has been having a really good run on the Nintendo Gamecube, really. With titles like the excellent 3D platforming adventure Pac-Man World 2 and the fun multiplayer experience that is Pac-Man Vs. under the dot-muncher's sleeves, not to mention a Namco Museum containing Arrangement games.

So why the heck did Namco allow this to be placed onto store shelves? Trust me when I say that the opening FMV video to the game was the best thing about it. Once you get that out of the way, you're thrown into a swarm of low-budget-ness, complete with Comic Sans font seen in menus and other bland screens. This includes the game itself, which is just a board game video game as a way to hop aboard the Mario Party train. Only problem: This is way worse than every Mario Party there is.

The game lets you pick one of THREE boards. Yes. Only three. Even worse, they are boards that you just race from start to finish on. I thought it'd be alright though, since a brief game could still be fun. However, they managed to make these boards DRAG. I could have sworn I was supposed to finish up my game like an hour or so prior. Instead, this is as slow as a snail's pace.
There are no dice blocks. Instead, the minigames actually start at the beginning of every turn. How far you move depends on how well you ranked in the minigame. Unfortunately, the minigames suffer from feeling like being made under a low budget, and were nowhere as fun as Mario Party minigames. Everything felt so static and soulless, especially in minigames where you drive a kart or throw darts/""discs"".

As a player walks across the board's spaces, there's no telling what BS could happen. There are Spring spaces (bounce player forward), Return spaces (opposite), spaces where a bunch of a player's coins could be taken away or earned easily. and Store spaces where players could spend on cheapness such as moving forward or SENDING OTHER PLAYERS BACK SPACES. Yeah, that's pretty fair, am I right?

With all that said, my first and so far only playthrough on one of the boards was dreadful. There were so many times where I couldn't land on a Store space, and I haven't even landed on a Spring space, yet the CPUs had several times. The fact that I won was nothing short of a miracle

I would have given this 2 stars, but the thing is - I never had fun with it. Even with crap games like Sonic 2006 or Rock & Roll Adventures, I've found a way to get at least a little bit of enjoyment out of them. But with this? I was rather stressed out by how luck-based many moves felt."
1398,1,"So, I looked over all the reviews here and thought I'd try out this cool looking headset. But when I connected it and started using it online, I was absolutely amazed at how bad it was, there was crackling on both ends(mic & speaker, it sounded liked the other players voices were speaking through a motorcycle helmet it sounded SO muffled and vice versa when I asked how I sounded, just a bad product, Stick with your old PS3 Sony Headset, its really not all that bad til you try one of these...

On a positive note, a 5 Star rating for Amazon, They are Fully refunding me for this unit."
1399,1,Terrible. I can't wait for COD to just die and go away. Getting worse and worse each year. Wouldn't have wasted my money if kid didn't beg for this for Christmas. I tried it out...what a joke of a game.
1400,1,"As a fan of playing tennis, I was very eager to try Top Spin 3. Since I use my Wii for exercise as well as entertainment, I like to play sports games -- especially tennis ones -- to get some activity. However, although I was initially looking forward very eagerly to Top Spin 3, I found that its execution was seriously lacking.

For one, there are only a handful of players even available, some of which aren't really all that intuitive to guess. I'm not a follower of professional tennis very closely, but even I could see that there are some glaring omissions. Also, there is no character creation, so the individual element is completely absent. They added a few original characters, but they somehow felt that they could not even include a rudimentary character creation mode? Sloppy.

What is most sloppy, however, and utterly disappointing is the game itself. No difficulty settings means that the unforgiving and often very bad control scheme has to be accustomed to on the fly. A pathetically inadequate tutorial does not excuse this fundamental omission. Furthermore, the controls themselves are as far from intuitive as possible; the controller is, for some reason, held sideways. The player's character moves on-screen in a stuttering mess that frequently prevents him from reaching an adequate point from which he may return the ball. The controls, which are supposed to mimic the player's own movements, rarely do this and are token at best. Typically you will try for a special shot exactly as the tutorial instructed, only to have it ignore your movements or misinterpret them.

That doesn't even begin to address the other fundamental problems it has, such as the fact that it doesn't feel like you actually control anything. Even the pop-up help instructs you to time your swings to match the on-screen player. Why, then, are we instructed to swing at all, if the game itself tries to anticipate our swing and then make us match theirs?

I thought that Top Spin 3 would surely be more satisfying than Sega Superstars Tennis which, while a pretty good game, lacked in tournaments and was too harsh when it came to unlockables through them. There also wasn't that much responsiveness depending on specific motions by the player, which Top Spin 3 was supposed to address. Unfortunately, however, it didn't. Sega Superstars Tennis remains a vastly superior game, both in entertainment value and tennis authenticity, even with the super moves.

To boot, Sega Superstars Tennis also had three control schemes, which Top Spin 3 would have benefited from; the movement in Top Spin 3 is atrocious and unresponsive at the worst times. Having an option to handle it automatically would have been a great relief. However, they opted for the extremely awkward option of holding the Wii remote sideways, for no valid reason.

All in all, Top Spin 3 plays like an unfinished tech demo that should never have left the studio. It's a poor excuse for a tennis game, but moreover it's a poor excuse for a game overall. With horrible music, barely adequate sound effects (and an absolutely gratingly annoying umpire/judge voice that belches out his calls), and mediocre graphics, it looks like an unfinished PS2 game that they thought they could slap a full asking price on and sell.

This game isn't even worth bargain bin trips. Give it a miss and buy Sega Superstars Tennis instead, or wait for a more satisfying realistic tennis game. Top Spin 3 isn't it. In fact, it isn't much of anything at all."
1401,1,broke my Xbox and then deleted all my saved data that was transferred on it and that was on my Xbox itself. do not buy.
1402,1,"I cant find anything in this game that really stands out that would place it above other games of the CRPG genre.  Any game that has regenerating crates and barrels that you can smash for gold, and pop-up monsters that come out of the ground out of nowhere takes this genre back about 10 years and in computer years, that makes this game ancient.  A definite no-go for me, there's too many other good games out there, including ancient ones (Arx Fatalis is a fantastic game that I would much rather play than this tripe)."
1403,1,Is not a real game booo!!! Is a story-line type of game. No sorry if I wanted that I have comic books. Very disappointed.
1404,1,"There are no difficulty settings in this game so unless you are a first person shooter hardcore fan, you will get stuck quite often. I play a lot of games and love the first person genre, but without the difficulty setting the game is only suited for people that have a LOT of time on their hands."
1405,1,"This was a 5/5 game. I've played it through on the 360 and it was great. But on the Xbox One, I'm stuck with a game ending bug. I cannot play through again since the bug could easily occur again so there's no point...

I backed out of the game when it was idle and it has corrupted a save. When the game loads, I hear a campfire but the screen is black and I cannot move or hit any buttons. Restoring from cloud does nothing. Square Enix forums, Xbox forums all seem to know about the bug...When it's fixed, I'll update again...

Update: I contacted the Square Enix tech support folks and they are supposedly taking gamertags of those affected. It took a couple of complaint emails -- their first responses are idiotic (please adjust the sound in the sound settings - how the hell would I do that if I can't even press any button whatsover - and who actually believes adjusting the sound would unfreeze a game - absolutely moronic response).

There are a few current crazy theories on how to fix this error. 1 way involves using 2 xbox's (you recover the gamesave to the new xbox (not sure if the 2nd one should or shouldn't be patched). another involves trying to pull down your save via cloud but disrupting it so it doesn't work, then creating a new game, playing to one of the cutscenes, then going back to the old save. I've tried something like this and it didn't seem to do anything...I'm going to try again with a more involved process...

Pretty stupid..."
1406,1,cannot change the controls and they are not what I play like.  RUINS it.
1407,1,"Well that sucked. Its so poorly manufactured that it didn't work.

I posted a picture of what the tip looks like.  Because its really obvious.  This is just zoom in to make it clear, but even a quick look at the bit and you can see it.  Someone at the factory or the seller should check these for flaws.  Because they are not hard to see.

Anyway I'm filing a complaint on Amazon and asking for my money back."
1408,1,"I don't think you can hit Play and enjoy an instant, easy, stress free racing game. Game forces you to join a team and forces play through pre-determined not-very-much-fun challenges. I've tried playing this a few times and quit after 10 minutes each time."
1409,1,"I'm an Orson Scott Card fan so I really wanted to like it--but it's just a terrible game.  The psychic powers are so overwhelming they feel like cheats.  With several of the powers you can clear the entire screen of baddies once every two seconds or so for the entire game so the only way to have fun is to intentionally weaken yourself.  The weapons are unsatisfying and a confusing chore to select.

The best thing about the ""flick targeting system"" is that you can ignore it.  The baddies come in Serious Sam type waves to be mowed down by your double guns plus smart-bomb psychic powers, so precise targeting is pretty silly.  Navigating your character is frustrating. You can stand next to a platform you're supposed to grab onto and jump many times before your hands latch on to the edge.  I died from that and the buggy jump controls more than from fighting the bad guys.

About half the sound effects are flat out missing, so many actions have little impact. Overall the game feels very untested and buggy.  The story is kinda cool but VERY lightweight next to Card's novels.  The characters maintain their same flippant attitude no matter how many of their own people die around them. If you're used to playing quality FPS games like H-L2, FEAR, Call of Duty, etc you will be disappointed."
1410,1,Boring Boring Boring Boring waste of money
1411,1,"I Would love to give this negative stars...What kind of monster would overprice and reproduce a game so extensively. This game being released on any major device besides being a downloadable app is complete garbage. This game/company is literally trying to prey on any young person with access to their parents credit card or weak-willed parent willing to indulge their spoiled child...I got angry birds star wars edition free through itunes as one of their free-apps of the week...

Honestly..from the looks of it..activision bought the rights and reproduced this game at a high price..I never remember angry birds being an activision game in the past...so I feel that activision bought the rights to reproduce the game at high prices and rip people off... F you activision, you are obviously a piece of s***, money grubbing company who I will be sure to never trust or buy anything from ever again!"
1412,1,Not very interesting unless you like to kill thousands of enemies using the same combos over and over. The game also doesn't run as well on the original 3ds compared to the new 3ds.

1414,1,"This game is SO OVERRATED. Campaign was short. Multiplayer was the same as Halo 3. The missions in campaign that were ok are what kept me giving this a 1 star in the ""fun"" rating. I mean, this game blows. Its Conflict Desert Storm with a different case and slightly different missions and characters. This game is such a disgrace to the COD series. I LOVED 1,2, and 3. This one BLOWS!!!!! Get Army of Two/BioShock/R6V/R6V2 and put your 60 dollars to good use. See you later!

UPDATE4/12-I know Halo is unrealistic. I think everybody knows that. At least this game is somewhat realistic. But
1)Turrets Overheat in this game. TURRETS DONT OVERHEAT!!! I've shot turrets before, and you have to reload them after 100 shots(which you don't do in COD4 i think you know), BUT THEY DONT FU**ING OVERHEAT!! WTF!!
2)Why cant you take silencers off the guns? I know you cant do that in AO2, so don't tell me. But why cant you reach down, and screw the silencer off. Thats BS
3)Graphics. Sure they look great. BUT ONLY IF YOU  STAY PUT IN 1 ROOM. THEN THEY ALL LOOK THE FREAKIN SAME!!!
Okay have a nice day goodbye"
1415,1,"ok were to start.  when i buy a new game i want it to be different from the last one in the line.  this is the same game, but shorter. i don't mean a little shorter i mean a lot shorter. you can beat all lvls of diff in lest than a day. the multiplayer is the real down fall.  the selection of maps are dismal. it take you about 20 minutes to play all boards then you are board. you do get a map editor but most people that you would play with refuse to play on eachs custom maps. no real change in weapons. some new vehicals but not significant. they added game modes within game mods witch was a waste, idont need a rocket ball when i can change all that in the match settings. the multiplayer is what sells these games,  they could have done alot better. the game is fun for a day or 2 but after that it is like well what now.  if you refuse to play any fps multiplayer besides a halo play halo 2.  if you wanna play a real fps buy a ps3 or a pc and play unreal 3.  that is how you make a multiplayer fps."
1416,1,"complete garbage, I tried to watch netflix on it, and it spent more time loading than playing the movie, and in gta it doesnt save any of my progress. not only that but the controller has rediculously low battery life. buy an xbox or a pc"
1417,1,"This is my third Razer mouse. Wish i learned my lesson with the first two. Razer mice DO NOT last long. First one i had lasted 14 months, second one lasted 12 months, and the third and final mouse lasted 8 months. Thank god this one is still under warranty but I can't imagine going through the RMA process with Razer. The mouse worked perfectly at first but after a few months of moderate use, it starts acting up. Side buttons would stop working. Mouse laser completely shuts off. Restarting the PC was the only solution. Imagine being heavily invested in a gaming session and you have to restart your pc because of your mouse. STAY AWAY. NO MORE RAZER PRODUCTS!"
1418,1,Fake
1419,1,"I would not recommend the sequel to anyone simply because it does not live to any of the expectations it was amounted to. The new infected characters are lousy and not very creative, it has become overly complicated and lost all of its fun as well as a notable decrease in the quality of graphics. It is no wonder Valve has spent over $25 million dollars advertising the game since otherwise it would have failed, which I believe it definitely deserves to. Instead of adding to the first feature of the game the company rushed through a second production in a year coming up with something that is pretty much useless and much worse than the first game. Left 4 Dead 2 does not really bring anything new, in the sense of concept, it just changes characters which I could do very well by using some skins and provides some new maps to shoot each other in. Not worth it."
1420,1,piece of crap but at least they paid shipping.
1421,1,"It is one of the most primitive fpc games in a while.  The enemies are as dumb as bricks, running straight toward you every time firing at you.  The graphics are no where close to current standards more like the standard of the old Duke Nukem 3D game. The weaponfire is the most unrealistic of any fpc I have played(that's quite a few).  Even the gore is fake looking and really unnecessary if you ask me.  Don't waste your money on this game unless you need something to go under the leg of a table to balance it or something.  This game is misrepresented by it's description as it says you are a cia agent using stealth and strategy when all you do is run and shoot the whole time. Avoid this game like the plague."
1422,1,"Often times I have been amazed to read 5 star reviews for truly awful games.  I have always viewed them with suspicion but allowed for the possibility of some folks simply having different tastes.  This is why I found the reviews for Major League Baseball 2K6 so facinating.  This is a game that is defective and due to the defect, freezes.  So, even if someone has very low standards, they could not honestly give a defective game 5 stars.  Well, take a look at the 5 star reviews here and you can finally see proof that there really are planted, fake reviews. Call me naive for needing this type of evidence, but guess I am too much the optimist. Now, who do we think planted them? lol"
1423,1,"I would write a full review, but others have written better reviews and covered it quite well. I just wanted to add in my bad review after being ripped off by Activsion/Blizzard. I will not buy another product made by them unless they totally change management and make games honestly, not to rip people off for profit."
1424,1,"Broke in a week. What can I say.
The left joystick will continue to break. I have owned three of these in multiple colors."
1425,1,It's an old XBOX game that wouldn't work on my XBOX 360 console.  That's the risk you run getting old games.
1426,1,"This game has GOT to be the dullest bore I've ever encountered.  And believe me, I've played a few.  And this is supposed to be the premier, the apex of the ""survival/horror"" genre?  Oh my God!!! I was too busy yawning to be even the slightest scared.  I FINALLY got to and wandered around the prison for a while trying to find stuff and finally said, ""Enough is enough"" and deleted this lame piece of tedium from my computer.  Look, if you're into traipsing around some town and it's various structures in the fog and dark, endlessly looking around for doors and hard to see items to add to your inventory and solving puzzles, which I hate doing, than this is the game for you.  The dialogue is awful, the story is pathetic, the combat is lame and I get more scared opening the door to kiddies on Halloween night for crying out loud.  I was getting so weary with this thing I finally downloaded a walkthrough just to end my agony and I still said to heck with this.  Life is too short.  I never felt so good freeing up space on my hard drive. After reading all the reviews about how scary this game is and after playing Doom 3, FEAR and Dead Space, which were scary, I was really disappointed with this game.  In fairness I must say I played the game on easy, easy on puzzles and easy on combat.  Maybe it's scarier on hard but I'm not going to hang around to find out."
1427,1,"-The money earned from races is pathetically little. MICROTRANSACTIONS! You have the option to spend real money to then earn more in-game money per race.

-The Suzuki Hayabusa is a free DLC in the Day One Edition of the game which I have. Should be standard.

-There are bikes as rewards, but I don't know what category they are. It should be listed what class it is 'cause I don't know just by looking at them always. Overall I do know them, but to me they're all motorbikes. List the category of the reward bikes.

-I can't ride the H2 or H2R in sport or supersport races because the H2 and H2R are given a class of their own. The cover bike has so little available show in the game.

-I'd like the ability to do a full custom paint job of the bikes and not have such little limitations. I'd like Gran Turismo options or something.

-When you try to sell a bike, it'll be at a loss. In Shift 2, you can sell cars and get back all of the money you put into it. Another way this game extends the grind to get you to buy the money/race DLC thing.

-(Girl riders could have nicer butts. This is an opinion.)"
1428,1,"Thought it was a version of Angry Birds that played like the popular cell phone game, instead it was more of a regular arcade game. Disappointed."
1429,1,"The first couple of reviews for this game is exactly on point. This game looks, sounds, feels like an original XBOX game.  I thought we were past horrible game development but I guess not. The graphics, sound, driving mechanics, repetitive missions are are horrible.

They need to release a Fast and Furious arcade port from the driving/racing game where you race to upgrade your car.  That arcade had a cruising USA feel but was really fun."
1430,1,"As much as I love Nintendo to death, I was never a fan of the Wii. Although there were a lot of classics like Super Mario Galaxy, Madworld, Boom Blox and Twilight Princess, there was a crapton of shovelware. Out of all the Wii games I've played, this has to be the worst of the worst. The gameplay is extremely repetitive,  the graphics look like they belong on the Philips Cdi, the music is bland and annoying and the plot is stupid (yes, this game actually has a plot). Basically, the plot of the game is that you're a farmer who all the sudden decides to shoot his chickens for no reason, that's it and there's even a cutscene of it which is absolutely pointless for such a simple plot. When you get in the game, you'll realize how boring the game is. All your doing is pointing your wiimote at the screen and shooting chickens and the sounds they make are so obnoxious. Heck, some of them don't even look like chickens, despite the game being called Chicken Shoot. Unless you've played it for yourself, you have no idea how unsatisfying and boring this game is. In my opinion, this is probably the third worst game ever made, only behind CrazyBus on the Genesis and Hong Kong 97 on the Super Famicom, it's that bad. If you want a good game where you shoot birds, play Duck Hunt. Unlike this pile of Chicken S*** (no pun intended), Duck Hunt is very fun to play. It actually feels satisfying to shoot something and it's not even boring because it actually plays like a game, I love Duck Hunt so much despite how annoying the dog is. Heck, Duck Hunt is so good that the dog and the duck are playable in Smash Bros! Are you gonna see any of these stupid chickens or that farmer in Smash Bros? Nope, because this game is garbage."
1431,1,"This is very difficult to play and not very realistic. The announcers suck and the movements of the players aren't lifelike. The run like they have to poop and throw like they are throwing for the first time. Madden has steadily gone down hill the past few years. There needs to be another competitor to compete with them because madden is getting way to cocky. They are making no improvements and you are basically buying the same game every year. Although they add a bunch of ""new"" stuff, it makes the game worse.

I would pass on this one"
1432,1,"I can not make the change the code, residue in Venezuela, that can help me?"
1433,1,"it has not worked like advertised out of the box and  although i went looking for the Cd it did not come with any. went on line to  download software/update and could not get the action replay to connect to the program, with and without the ds lite. today(15-10-2012) it is showing a white screen after it is  put on and cannot access any data. hoping this will  warn people before buying product(sigh). really wanted this to work though. needed some of the  events. only got it the day before. probably got a bad batch or something."
1434,1,The code has been used.. wasted all my time and gas getting it..
1435,1,"But releasing it so late for the PC makes it an unworthy competitor to today's top FPS games like UT2003/Unreal 2, America's Army: Operations, the upcoming AA: Special Forces, and other FPS games.
Halo multiplayer is also extremely flawed. In Blood Gulch, good banshee pilots will simply start spawn killing and the opposing team won't be able to get a foothold in the battle (CTF).
Or worse, you have team killers who also ruin the fun.
The banshee and warthog interface isn't what I expected.
If they used the Descent engine for the Banshee, and Rallisport Challenge for the Warthog, then it'd be one heck of a game.
Overall, it's not worth the money to buy this game since it's already 2 years old. Save your money for something up to date and more fun."
1436,1,Worked for a few days then stopped. Safe the money and buy a good one!
1437,1,"I WAS GIVEN A UK VERSION OF THE GAME WHERE YOU CANNOT USE ANY OF THE ONLINE DLC CONTENT AND YOU CANNOT BUY OR USE ANY EXTRA CONTENT. ON TOP OF THAT WHEN I TRADED IT IN LATER ON THEY DID NOT ACCEPT IT BECAUSE ITS THE UK VERSION, BUT THAT IS WHAT I WAS SOLD"
1438,1,it feels horrible
1439,1,"Worked well for about  3 weeks, and started losing connection. Garbage, would advise another cable.."
1440,1,"I had high hopes for the Venus mouse.  First off the packaging is nice, still smiling at this point.  The mouse also feels pretty darn good in my hand.  Comfortable and ergonomic enough. After getting through a bit of the Chinglish (poorly written English, from China) I got the mouse installed and working.  This is where things start to get bad.

The smooth plastic footing was stuck on crooked and was peeling up in two places.  Not a huge deal as they provide a replacement with the mouse.  The tuning weights were also not included with my mouse.  There is a black container but not metal weights in it or the mouse.  :(

The most important thing for a gaming mouse (imho) is the ability to track well as well as programmable buttons for MMO.  The list of features, and price, look good but the tracking is pretty bad.  I am using an expensive gaming mouse pad and thought this might be the problem.  I tried it on a wooden desk and also with a plain black mouse pad.  Long story short there is significant lag and jittery movement.  I restarted my gaming rig, I tried re-installing the software, etc... It would work well for 20-60 seconds and then the cursor would hop around.  I have a hard time believing this is true 16,400 DPI.  I have no way of figuring this out.  If it is a true 16,400 DPI mouse it must be using an inexpensive sensor.

Sadly the tracking issues are bad enough that I can't use this mouse for gaming let alone daily use."
1441,1,"I like TMNT but this game es like playing a SNES game in a super computer. Every time you die, the game returns you very far and start over smashing. Terrible, you have to find the out of shadows game."
1442,1,"Tales from the Boarderlands. I bought this thinking it would be like the other games in this series. However there's no crosshair, your view isn't first-person and there's very little actual shooting you can do. They really dropped the ball on this one and it's fair to say that I will not be buying another product from these developers. To switch the genre of game when your previous games were so much fun is a massive mistake. I really hope the developers have a word with themselves and they lose lots of income with maybe a few redundancies because I lost out big time paying them for this abortion."
1443,1,"I haven't used this even once because I don't need it. All it is, is a pricey audio adapter for xbox controllers."
1444,1,"Unfortunately this is another game with draconian DRM. The always-online DRM combined with Blizzard's server instability have left me with what amounts to a defective product. Pirates on the other hand, are happily playing the game offline. Yet another drop in the ocean of proof that DRM only hurts paying consumers.

Vote with your dollars. If you have already bought the game and are dissatisfied, request a refund from amazon(or your vendor of choice) as this product is defective.

If you have not already bought the game, see below.

Do not buy if:

-You want to play your game when Blizzard's servers are down.

-Your ISP is unreliable

-You want a game to play when travelling and offline

-You are otherwise without internet for any period of time when you might play

-You care about consumer rights"
1445,1,"I got this hooked up to my PC with minimal fuss. I plugged the USB cable and optical cable into the base and my PC. I configured the Windows audio to use the USB for communications and the Optical for sound. The instructions are pretty vague but it isn't too difficult to figure out.

I charged the headset fully. Then I put them on to try them out and to my horror there was a constant buzz in the right channel. Not a blow my ears out buzz but a nice low annoying buzz like electronic interference generated by computer equipment if you know what I mean. It didn't change frequency often but does alternate once in a while between two different pitches. It persisted in the background and was audible through music and sounds during quieter spots.

I tried disconnecting from my PC thinking it was the source but it still persisted. I tried putting a ferrite core on the USB cable and it didn't help. Even when I power the base off and plugged my cell phone directly into the headset with the included cable it persisted.

I normally use a set of Corsair Vengeance 2000 wireless headphones on my PC and a set of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 earphones everywhere else.

In my testing I found the sound to be average at best. The bass was there but the mids and highs sounded off to me. Especially the highs sounding harsh to me. I even think the Turtle Beach PX4 wireless headphones sounded better than these and I wasn't too crazy about those either.

Nothing else I could say about this headset really matters with the constant buzzing problem. It is unacceptable to me. I did a search for afterglow buzzing and found lots of hits for PDP headphones, this and other models. Maybe I got a bad set but with the number of hits I got in my search I question the quality control or maybe even the overall design. I am not sure what is causing the buzz but I know that none of the other wired or wireless speakers and headsets that I have exhibited a buzz like this. It isn't too often that I dislike a product enough to give it one star but this one just rubs me the wrong way. Even if it didn't buzz I don't think that I'd like it that much due to the way it sounds to me.

Overall in my opinion a headset that I would not recommend. If you do decide to try them make sure you get them from somewhere with a good return policy so you can try them out and return them if you don't like them or have buzzing like I do."
1446,1,"I'd hold off a bit until they work some bugs out. I installed, then had to un-install to get it working. I actually havnt played it yet but I am a big fan of all the GR series. I am sure I won't be disappointed, but I'd wait for it to be cheaper and less buggy. The forums had some PO'd people on it. It appears it may have been a quick release or a bad ""port over"" from a console. I really don't care what it is/was as long as it plays well. Hold off though.

UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

The forums are a bloodbath and tech support is overwhelmed. There are many horror stories.
The game CTD's for many many people. I could not even get it to run for 3 weeks. It CTD'd before getting to the main screen. I finally had to fix it myself by uninstalling and re-installing many times and trying different methods. My key was to NOT let it patch the first time and setup the game first with the orgininal version 1.0 Once I got that to run, I saved all my settings and then let the game auto patch.

If you are a fan of the Ghost series, you might be disappointed. This is a port over from a console game. Very badly. some fo the in game screens are from an Xbox! lol.
There is not ""first person"" view. Extremely disappointing for me. I haven't played much but I don't believe there is any AI. It took like 10 minutes to find and join a MP session. I had no control over selection of servers. It just placed me in one.

Frankly, at the moment its a horror story. I'd hold off buying until it hits the bargain bin ,,, or the waste bin. Its not worth the current price."
1447,1,Awful
1448,1,Game is not good as 2K14...should've listened to the reviews.
1449,1,"Context
==========
I'm a web developer and gamer. I spend at least 15 hours each day every day on the computer using this product and 2 other Razer products. All three products (including this one) were purchased approximately 2 years ago.

My Relationship with Razer
==========
I was a Razer fanboy when I first got all of three of these products. In hindsight, I was about as stupid as people who blindly buy any Apple product.

All three Razer devices I'm writing about have failed. Using a BestBuy warranty, I have replaced them all at some point or another for failing.

I would NOT anymore recommend Razer products to anyone. I apologize to my friends who I raved about their products to, as now they are experiencing the same issues and terrible products I am.

Razer Lycosa Keyboard [This review] (In trash)
Razer Naga Mouse (In trash)
Razer Carcharias Headset (In trash)

Simple Summary Review - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
This keyboard is a very nice looking keyboard that functions decently as a keyboard. However, considering the premium price, I expect that the advertised features work and that this keyboard, at a minimum, functions as a keyboard should with no unexpected and unbelievably frustrating behavior. Unfortunately, not with this product or brand. After going through 2 keyboards over a period of 2 years, I'm throwing this device in the trash where it belongs. I'll never buy a Razer product again.

Pros - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard is truly a beautiful piece of plastic. I'm a particular fan of the matte buttons, which are hard to get dirty and easy to clean.
 - It is perfectly visible and usable in completely dark environments.
 - The buttons are very easy to press, leading to less wrist strain over long periods of time.

Cons - Razer Lycosa Keyboard
==========
 - This keyboard has a severe issue of getting stuck signals. It's like a key is stuck, but it's not. The only way to resolve is by unplugging the keyboard. This happens quite regularly, even without using the keyboard at all. I can't count the number of mornings I've woken up, turned on my monitor, only to find my keyboard just a typing an infinitely long Windows password on my locked computer. It's dreadfully annoying in gaming environments. Example: ""Sorry guys, I didn't mean to pull the boss. My keyboard is acting wierd!""
 - The media controller (touchpad) is absolutely useless. I have never gotten it to work, and it always goes crazy. It will regularly turn your volume down. It will constantly flash the keyboard lights. It will always start playing music when you aren't even near your computer. I contacted Razer support, and you know what they suggested? That I put a quarter on it! Yes, it a quarter will completely disable the touchpad. So for the past 2 years, I've been using a quarter to keep my wonky keyboard under my control, sacrificing one of the biggest reasons I wanted the keyboard to begin with.
 - The included USB port doesn't work. The power strength is a fraction of what normal USB ports are from my computer (so charging a phone, for example, takes multiples longer than using a USB port on the back of the computer). In addition, I've yet to get any device to actually function in it. Thumb drives are so convenient to plug in there, but the port simply doesn't work. Yes, I plugged both cables on the keyboard in. It just doesn't work.
 - The lights appear very dull through the buttons. This can be a pro or a con, as the lights shouldn't be distracting. However, I think it's just a little too dull, as it looks like the lights are failing. Pop a key off, though, and it's plain to see that the actual light source underneath is insanely bright.

In Hindsight
==========
I wish I had more nice things to say, but unfortunately, the truth is what it is. I wish I wasn't initially blinded by brand name, and I wish I would have done more research. Unfortunately, the past is the past, and the money spent on these 3 Razer products is lost forever. I hope Razer can fix their products in future generations, but I will never give them another shot. This is a premium product with a premium design. However, the functionality of their devices are equivalent of cheap knock-offs made in China."
1450,1,"The original XCOM is one of the best games ever made. I liked the more recent one okay enough, but it felt a little empty and so I was looking forward to XCOM 2 which promised more content.

Well the game looks great and seems to have the content, but ti's badly broken. Steam refunded me - I'll wait a year and see if it's all patched up then. I should have listened to reviews."
1451,1,too difficult and not enough hints to even be bothered playing this game. I hated it
1452,1,You actually get the cheap  Mario Bros series rosalina
1453,1,"I would like to give a higher rating, however I just can't bring myself to. I had the highest expectations for this game and it did not deliver. I pre-ordered back in August and when it arrived I played for a week straight. After that I would play maybe a couple times a week, now I haven't played it in over a month. This game has no replay value and once you get over the initial awe of Star Wars sounds and environments, it is just re-skinned Battlefront with less functionality and NO CAMPAIGN WHATSOEVER. If they would have delivered the exact same minimalist single player campaign that Battlefront 2 had ten years ago I would have given this a 4 star rating.

To top it off the content is extremely limited and they want you to pay another $50 for the season pass!!! When the game 10 years ago already had so much more. $110 for an incomplete game? No thanks.

What a joke, although I guess that is to be expected with EA."
1454,1,"As a long, long time fan of Sim City, this was a day 1 purchase for me. Along with the rest of the world, I was in for a gaming hell attempting to even play. With features of the game being shut off, and no way to play offline at launch, I was along many that for weeks had an unbearable experience even attempting to play the game. After getting one city finally in a ""cool"" state, my area ran out of resources and shuttling in new ones wasn't functioning. Everything I struggled to build, died shortly after. I tossed the game on my shelf and haven't looked back since.

Maxis has tried with several patches to fix things, but each time it sounds like they break just as much. Just recently they have announced an offline patch, so there is a chance the game has come along ways and would be enjoyable again. Personally, i'm not willing to back at this point. A sad story of an amazing franchise."
1455,1,"Update: I am now having the doubleclick issue, so I have to buy a new mouse. Also, the Logitech software is loaded with SPYWARE.

Intermittently drops out during play when used in hardware mode. Not portable in the sense that you can config it on hardware, put it on any computer, *and expect it to perform reliably during play.* It's not a gaming mouse, if it doesn't perform reliably. Also incredibly frustrating is the extra third click button's incredibly low tactile feedback compared to the other two. it's mushy and inaudible, and feels the way your mouse would click if you'd been gumming it up on your desk for 2 years already.

Update:
Now using only the offboard profiles.
The software has been very buggy and sometimes completely ignores my user-set lighting settings (static obviously) in favor of running its little crazy pulsing breathing color-cycling demo mode. Very annoying and distracting esp in the dark.

The tilt-switches (left-right/forward-back) on the scroll-wheel don't have consistent tactile feedback between left and right so one of them you have to push a little harder than the other. Kinda distracting.

The 12-key has every button labeled something like ""G9"" through ""G17"" to represent ""1"" through ""9"". Yes, 1 is G9 and 9 is G17. Logitech are total idiots and this is the sad result of overbranding.

The 12-key is a little soft, chunky, and *wobbly,* hard to tell if you're over the right button and reduces overall stability of your grip on the mouse while you're activating. Something a bit more rigid and *not totally loose in its housing* would be more ideal for fast-paced precision gaming, which again, this mouse does not fit the bill for. It is nowhere near the quality a pro or even weekend FPS player would be looking for.

Update 2: Wow, I still can't stop the lights on this thing from pulsing when they decide randomly they want to do that. I verify the config is set to all effects off. If I don't want distracting pulses I have to kill the lights entirely. Boy am I tired of throwing money away on garbage. This mouse just lost a core feature, because it's unusably f annoying. No more RGB lighting."
1456,1,"After all these years playing video games I'm still searching for one like Nato Commander (Commodore 64). I was hoping this would be it. This is more like Command and Conquer(PC). Though I like Command and Conquer better.  The voice control is the only thing cool about this game.

 I felt like I had very little control over my troops, tanks and helicopters....and then when you give them a command they attack as if its a free for all....totally un-organized and very unrealistic. To me the way they attack you'd think they had 0 training, no clue of war strategy, and a dead commander.

I was also disappointed with the view of the action going on....it would be nice if you could zoom in and out your view of the battle field....

....rent it first, then buy it if you like it....I wish I would have, then I could have saved $60+tax."
1457,1,"I am serious. This game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to WCW Nitro for Playstation but it ranks up there with it. This game has two modes, no endings, 20 Characters, no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured Smackdown. I suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it. THQ failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is 4 stars. THIS GAME IS BAD! And this is coming from a gamer of 20 years...."
1458,1,"Man, this $50 game from the Big Corporation called Electronic Arts totally stinks.  It's got some of the worst car racing physics I've ever seen, and the controls are totally user-unfriendly.  The cars handle like crazy, and the A.I. of the computer-controlled racers is totally uneven and takes away the last bit of fun from this game.  Don't waste your $50 on a crappy game like this.  I'm already very pissed I wasted $7 renting it from Blockbuster.  Even though I could have kept it for two weeks, I returned it after less than one.  This game truly sucks, big time.

If you want a good racer for the PSP, check out Ridge Racer, which, admittedly, is a different kind of racing experience but at least it's got good car physics models in it.  Or just wait for the release of Gran Turismo or Burnout."
1459,1,"It's like they made an Elder Scrolls game and removed all the good things about the Elder Scrolls, and they made an MMO  minus all the good interface and interaction of an MMO.  If anything this should be a free to play, waste of money for this product, but the story is dry, graphics are ok, not a lot of impact in combat or PvP.  They basically sacrificed having a good game trying to make it more immersive and failed.  Bethesda should of stuck to console ES."
1460,1,"I'm a huge fan of shooting gallery games and have been ever since playing Operation Wolf in the arcades and Capone on the Commodore Amiga back in the day.  I was raised on Taito shooters and weened on Time Crisis.  Lucky for me, the advent of the Playstation Move has afforded the PS3 some good light gun games, including Time Crisis, The Shoot, House of the Dead Overkill, and Dead Space: Extraction.  They're not the most advanced games on the planet, and that's undoubtedly reflected in their review scores, but if you're looking for shooting galleries on hi-def system, you could do worse.

Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is the aforementioned ""worse.""  Oh, boy, is it ever worse.

There are so many things disastrously bad about this game, I don't know where to begin.  Remember Area 51 and Maximum Force back in the arcades?  Remember how cheesy they looked, even at a time when full-motion video in arcade games was ""hip""?  Hell, do you remember Revolution X with Aerosmith?

HFA is a worse-made product than all three of them.  While the environments you pass through during missions are passably animated, the animation of all characters is amateurish and looks about early Playstation 2-level.  That would be excusable (heck, I like Crypt Killer and that game is ugly as sin) if it weren't for the actual FEEL of moving in the environments and interacting with these generic Taliban ragdolls.

For one, the controls are misbegotten.  You CANNOT use this game with any gun controller because the default controls are so needlessly complicated.  Instead of adopting Time Crisis' system of reloading and seeking cover with a single button press, HFA seeks to emulate the controls of a first-person shooter:  You need to press X, O, Move button, and trigger to do different things at different times, and simply taking cover requires moving the Move controller itself in some arbitrary direction while holding down a button.  It's NONSENSE.  Whoever thought up this control scheme is a masochist without any penchant for the light gun genre.

The firefighting itself is no better.  The Move controller requires a more finicky calibration than in other light gun games, and you'll notice that the smallish reticle will move in a jerky motion no matter how you've set it up.  Foes jump out from the requisite positions of ""behind generic crate"" and ""next to exploding, conveniently-placed barrel,"" but your only indication that their poorly animated firing is hitting you is a tiny bullet hole in glass and perhaps a chip off your health bar.  You could be excused for thinking you breezed through one of the game's levels only to find out you were actually hit three times--you just didn't notice.  Hit detection on the enemies is similarly and predictably poor.

Perhaps most hilariously, a giant SAVING GAME message appears WHILE enemies are shooting at you and obstructs your view!  What genius came up with that brilliant idea?!

Somewhere in all this mess, there's an actual story and lots of levels in which the player does generic Military Video Game things, like shoot from turrets and... shoot from turrets on helicopters.  The setting, ""story,"" and main character all feel so rote and tired that the game and its use of Afghanistan end up feeling more exploitative and insulting to our men and women fighting there than it does patriotic.

Perhaps if they had made a better video game....

Look, if you're like me, you're a shooting gallery fan who is interested in this game because you figure it will give you something of a cross between Time Crisis and Modern Warfare for a budget price.  Let me spare you the misery: Don't be tempted.  At $19.99, Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is approximately $19.98 too expensive."
1461,1,"Worst gaming experience EVER, bar none!!!! Avoid like the PLAGUE! Seriously, it is worse than the black death!

Pros:
Its not Battlefront
can quit while 'host'
video glitches in MP seem fixed (apprently they traded glitchy lens flares for a complete crash - way to trade up there guys!)
uninstaller does NOT crash

Cons:
Controller aim-assist!  How is that NOT an aimbot??
Empty servers (unless you like deathmatch modes)
The Lobbies
The limitless number of prestige'd ""pro-players"" who still live in mommy's basement/garage/attic.
No players in the FUN game modes. Nothing but DM players, cuz wtf?
Matchmaking is typically 6 lvl 40 vs 3 lvl 2-6. Seems fair I guess?
Black Ops III Stoped Working (just because??)
Hosting a game == hard reboot required
Playing a game == hard boot required
The crashes. OMFG the crashes.
Forced hard reboots count as ""Play Time"" apparently.
Balance?  WTF is THAT?
Zombie mode?  Really?  That's just hands-down asstarded!

Worst gaming experience EVER, bar none!!!!"

1468,1,"On BioWare's official site, Kingmaker costs $8, Kingmaker Lite costs $6. Shadowguard costs $5 & comes with Witch's Wake for free, putting this pacakge at a value between $11 & $13. Apparently, the box they come in & disc they're burned on cost between $6 & $8, making this a bad value.

There is a reason BioWare is selling Shadowguard & Witch's Wake on their website at 2 for $5, & that reason is that Shadowguard & Witch's Wake are incomplete modules with unresolved cliffhanger endings. In Shadowguard, you're just about to persuit the party that razed your city & killed your father, & that's where it ends.

Kingmaker is a good mod. Do buy it, but don't buy this overpriced set to get it."

UPDATE: This piece of junk broke after exactly 8 months of use. I sat down at my computer this afternoon and the mouse was unresponsive, weird. A couple minutes later the lights turned off, okay. Plugged it in and out, 2.0 and 3.0, reinstalled the infamous synapse crapware, tried a different computer, prayed to the ancient cannibal gods, you know the usual stuff. Now I need to decide if I'm going to use this thing for batting practice or see if it I can chop wood on top of it, you know recycling is important to me, go green!"
1470,1,Returned you sick at making games.
1471,1,"It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it ""best game of all-time"" or ""best Castlevania game you'll ever play"".
I don't think so.  If you want a ""real"" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.
Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.
After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.
Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!
But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.
Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.
Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.
You're probably thinking by now ""Alright, talk about the actual GAME!""  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.
I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.
Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.
Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it."
1472,1,"Pros:
lots of customizable buttons
glides the best of any mouse I have used
I liked the razor software

Cons:

Stopped working after a week I had to return it, the mouse would no longer track
didn't fit my hand well- though I adjusted the way I held it, it was ok at best, crummy at worst
the build quality was cheap, it had some rough edges
The buttons weren't placed very well, it was hard to use the side buttons.

I have a death adder that I love, but it just doesn't have enough buttons for me, and having on the fly DPI adjustments is important to me...maybe not others. I have had MANY different mice over the years, the Lachesis looked good on paper, but not in the real world. The Lachesis seemed to work really well until it just stopped tracking. The buttons still worked and so did the scroll wheel, but it wouldn't track. I would have to say this mouse is pretty much a failure for Razor, especially when you read all of the people are having problems with this thing. Too bad.

I would have to recommend staying away from this mouse, there are too many good ones out there. I decided to replace this with the cyborg RAT7.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyborg-R-A-T-7-Gaming-Mouse-for-PC/dp/B003CP0BHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyborg R.A.T. 7 Gaming Mouse for PC</a>&nbsp;Maximum PC gave it a 10 kick a$$ award, I am going to give it a try. I will review it after I have had it for a while."
1473,1,"I bought this on sale at $40 from Amazon which is $30 more than it's worth if single player only is your thing. From the get-go the game is nothing but repetitive sequences of sit-and-watch cinematics with some guy screaming at the main character strapped to a chair and hurling F-bombs every other word followed by short linear action events, all of which got so tiring I was repeatedly hitting the skip key. The graphics are the only positive thing I can say about this iteration of CoD. PC Gamer magazine was right with it's review that - paraphrasing - likened CoD:BO to the Titanic having struck an iceberg. Absolutely no single player replay value whatsoever."
1474,1,He didn't like it
1475,1,"Hoo boy. Look at the pictures before buying. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this game, but it was not another installment in the series the way I wanted it to be. It's on me for not looking into it before I picked it up."
1476,1,"This game isn't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1. For a release on the PS2 this is a pathetic excuse. You'd be better off buying Syphon Filter 1 or 2, or Medal of Honor for the PS1, or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the PS2."
1477,1,"this is a really junk game... I tried it three different times to just see if maybe I am doing it wrong.  Nope, just a poorly designed mess... sorry I wasted the money.....already deleted from the drive."
1478,1,"Bulb sold me a broken ps3 then claimed it was for parts, while he posted pictures of gameplay and never mentioned parts, he had a foul attitude. But did return my money. Only the disc drive worked. Motherboard was fried, bluetooth antennae busted. The fan worked in a different ps3."
1479,1,"I have a new PC with windows 7 64 bit and I installed this on it. It installed OK (I think), but when I try to run it, I get an error on my monitor 'Unsupported Video Resolution'. My monitor is 1920x1200. I'm guessing it's trying to launch in something like 2560x?. I'm stuck because I have to start the game to change the resolution and I can't start the game because of the resolution.

I'm using the latest patch.

Hopefully EA will come out with a patch for windows 7.

I played it in Vista on my old computer and it was pretty good."
1480,1,"I played the first Starcraft and I enjoyed it as RTS was so new back then. This one is better graphics but similar gameplay, so what is my issue? Simple, same as Diablo 3, a server connection is always needed but so many people are playing at the same time that you are disconnected. I do not even do multiplayer online, don't have time for a crowd to join but I must stay online, fine I do and it still drops me. Before it was just perfect if you had to keep your game disk in and Blizzard would play for you knowing you could not copy their media at all. And I do have disks for this game which I purchased from Newegg or Amazon, don't remember which but I must quit after so many times I get disconnected. NOOOO, my internet service is on, I can go Ebay too and I am writing this on Amazon as soon as I got dumped by Blizzard server. This is exactly why I stopped playing Diablo 3. Frankly, I have the Reaper of soul and Heart of the swarm still in shrink wrap but I cannot tell anyone go buy Blizzard, if this is the best they can do for you."
1481,1,"Rockstar Games Social Club and Windows Live requirements just KILL this game for said reasons in the reviews ... and patches do not work.  It is like the STEAM STORMTROOPER COMPANY;  RUINING EVERY GAME THEY TOUCH.  But this time around it is not for GREED (as with the STEAM CO.).  It is so strange that I have absolutely NO problems with any other games on PC EXCEPT when STEAM is involved.  And now RG Social Club/ Windows Live, appear to cause the same type problems.  LEAVE THE GAMES ALONE !!!

Update: with some calls - got it going. my son loved the game,  Hated the R.G.'s Social Club and Windows Live crap (doesn't use it) and I didn't appreciate the R.G.'s Social Club icon latching onto my toolbar.  Leave the game alone!!!"
1482,1,"Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a dated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing."
1483,1,No grip.
1484,1,"I bought this back in may 2017. I use it strictly for Star Wars Galaxy. This stick is fantastic for the JTL content.  The buttons are easily mapped and stick is stiff, but responsive. Perfect for PVP.  My gripe though seems to be a common one after doing a lot of homework on way my ship was constantly rolling to the left. The twist function within the joystick doesn't seem to be durable as I've had to set up a return order.  Now this is where I really am annoyed.

Logitech, one of the largest accessory companies has been absolutely horrible about the claim I filed.  I've been waiting days on end for a response and was forced to go go back to amazon.com to see what they'd suggest.  To my surprise, Amazon went and ok'd the return due to the manufacturer not being supportive.  Big Kudos to Amazon.

Overall: maybe I just got a bad joy..  I really like the stick during the first few months of ownership. It's comfortable and ofters a wide variety of buttons that's convenient for your casual flyer. I've seen other sticks with separate throttle and buttons on this, but to be honest, i'm a lazy pilot and I don't want to have to figure out 2 controls vs having everything on one package. If something could be done about the poor durability for the twist function,  I think you would have a product, but like I said, maybe it's just a defective joy.

UPDATE:  11/14 -- Upon ordering a replacement, that was fulfilled by Amazon.com for a new replacement. I received a clunky oversized box and the joystick in a bag. No packing materials like popcorn. Needless to say, being livid is an understatement.  It's busted too.  Amazon has issued a refund for #2.

Honestly...  Don't buy this.  No joystick is worth this much headache."
1485,1,"This game blew me away with the opening.  It looks like a movie, Hollywood all the way!  Then you get to the race, and it all falls down.  Sure, it still looks spectacular, with smooth scrolling scenery and beautifully rendered tracks and cars, but then you hit the gas.  Then you hit the wall.  Then you hit the other wall!  Then you switch from wheel to gamepad, and hit more walls.  Then you finally try the keyboard, and nothing but wall!  The controls are beyond horrible.  You have ALL right, ALL left, or shaky center.  As soon as you get over 30 MPH, you'll start drifting.  As soon as you try to correct that drift, you'll find the nearest wall.  Simple as that.  I've tried all the sensitivity settings in the game and the only difference between them is how far you have to turn the wheel (or move the analog stick) before the car does its FULL turn.  It seems like such a simple thing that could really fix this game, but there it is.  Steer clear of this game while you still can steer!"
1486,1,Not enough MB's to play.
1487,1,"I am a shamed to say i purchased this game, it was brilliant until after you kill 200 ""baddies"" using the glave it's all the same old splat and blood, only 2 or 3 close range kills that get old quick. Guns sound under powered and uninspired. I feel that i have heard better sounding guns on the Mega drive.

Some of the skills you unlock for the glave are fun like shocking people with a flying glave is fun the first few times, but after that it's same old same old. Puzzles are the same one or two are difficult then they get easy.

Boss fights yawn o rama just lately i am feeling that boss battles aren't challenging in most games.

I am sorry if liked this game, but for what it was made out to be... just a waste of good game funds that could of been better spent

Not even worth a purchase from the bargain bin

Thanks for reading"
1488,1,"You say this fits the regular 3ds. Well, no it's too big. Kids were upset. Even the screen protectors won't work. Waste of money completely."
1489,1,It feels like your playing against a bunch of rabbits people jumping everywhere...
1490,1,"So i bought this game yesterday 6-11.  Couldnt wait to get off work so i could go play.  put the game in and actually sit through the tutorials.  Lets say i was very impressed with gameplay and how fluent it worked.... remember i am only in the tutorial.  After i finished tutorial i went to the saga.  Now being someone that owned all budokai's i was expecting a decent length and substancial storyline.  To say the least i was wrong.  I finished the story that night.  I mean what a rip i only got up to the cell saga?  I came in thinking it was all the way through to buu at least and had all the characters i came to love in budokai tenkaichi 3, seeing as that only makes sense.  What really bothers me is after each saga they fabricate a movie based on gameplay to wrapup what happened.  I think this space and time could have been better put into including a buu saga.  I mean most people just skip these low budget in game movies anyway, so why not give us something we want.  When i buy a game i buy it for substance some good gameplay.  Not half of a game with better graphics.  Btw they include the first disk of season one ......  Season one came out over a year ago and most of us fans already bought it.  Why give out something we already own.  Even worse why give out part of a season where you will still have to go out and buy the whole thing if you don't own it.  I mean seriousl what are we going to do with one out of six disks in a set.  Just a way to get ppl to sink more money into this franchise.  I strongly urge everyone to rent this game before buying so you can see exactly what its worth.  This game to me is WAS worthless and i am ashamed that they would even sell this game in the market let alone sell it for such a steep price.  Trust me you are better off getting something else.

Cons
1.  Game is short only through the cell saga.
2.  Game has cutscenes every 5 seconds during actual fighting which throw you offguard and confuse you.
3.  Maps are incredibly small.  you can successfully hit someone about 2-3 times before you hit a wall.
4.  Gamplay has no learning curve its ez to play with no skill involved
5.  YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SPECIALS with little to no delay before refire. tisk tisk
6.  Limited characters maybe 13 or so.
7.  Transformations make you weaker......why why would they do that.
8.  Game is 100% completed in one night.
9.  Absolutely no replay value at all.  I sold the game first chance i got.
10. When you near the end you hope the game finishes soon because it is soo bady.

Pro
1. Graphics look pretty good.

I know you were expecting more pro's but honestly this game is terrible."
1491,1,I just bought this from game stop for $36 this is way over priced

1493,1,Okay I just tried playing the demo of this game because someone advised this. I couldn't play it. It took like 5 minutes for him to close the door. Why do they move so slowly?

1494,1,NAAAAH
1495,1,I was really hoping it would be on the same levelas doom 3 and what doom 4 looked like. Sadly this game is stuck in the 90s with not much replay value and stunted mp.
1496,1,"Easily one of the most infuriating games I have ever played and I have played every RE game. - Not being able to defend, being stuck in some stupid house for hours only to get 1 hit killed - on easy mode mind you. Games are supposed to be fun and not infuriating. I had reservations about getting it because I prefer 3rd person over 1st person but stupid me got it anyway. Never again Capcom - I cancelled my preorder or MVC infinite beacause of this stupid game. - I'll just wait until Injustice 2 comes out and play that.

I'm still playing it but I'm only doing it because I paid for it not playing out of enjoyment, which is what a game should be."
1497,1,"I started out playing Console games Back when you had to place an overlay on the TV screen before there were PC games. When Pc games came along I switched to them. I have watched Pc games get better and better over the years untill thy reached there zenith about 5 years agoe. From that point on it has been a slow down hill slide. The games themselves seemed to get less Interesting to play. The graphics did not get any better. It just took a more expensive graphics card and more memory to play them at the optium resolution. The games started having a lot of problems even on the higher PC game rigs. The players had to start downloading more Patches just to keep the games playable even then they had to learn to live with multiple Crashes. The big Game producers started Introducing More road blocks to the PC games in the form of DRM,On line activation,Limited plays,Manditory joining Social Clubs,Having to regester the game. At the same time the lowly Consoles started getting better And better Graphics. Now the Console Graphics have finally cought up with the PC.I have switched back to playing Console games. Thy are the same games,Thy come out on the Consoles first then are ported to the PC,Thy play smoother on the consoles with less problems,No DRM or any of the other problems that plague PC games. The Games cost a little more for the Consoles but on the other hand a Console Rig costs less than just A top of the line PC Graphics card. Now that new PC's come loaded onley with VISTA or WINDOWS 7 Older games can no longer be played on them while thy can still be played on the Consoles. A few years agoe I predicted that Pc gamming would become Obsolete if we continued to buy PC games with all the restrictions. All I got was a lot on Flack from PC Gamers. Now it has got even worse than I thought it would. If you don't believe I predicted this check out my older reviews. As for the game review:Assassins Creed 2 is one of the best of a bad bunch!!!!!"
1498,1,This game would be wonderful if it worked and we were given maps that are larger. Sim City is more like Sim Town. This game should have been polished more before release. EA you suck why use always online DRM in a single player game wtf. Thats why Ea will ruin all their beloved franchises and have ruined other game companys as well(Bioware).Maybe I will give this game a chance if EA can fix the darn thing in future.

1501,2,"Don't purchase this expecting to get DLC that is story, they're just trials against the alien.
Wasn't worth the money in retrospect. I probably spent no more than an hour or two with this DLC."
1502,2,"Decent game. Would have enjoyed it more if I had played it before the Xillias. There was a lot of it that I really didn't like. The battle system was watered down, slow, neutered, tedious, unresponsive, the fusion with the Seraphs often made it more difficult to fight, and the artes seemed wholly ineffective. The rest of the gameplay was comparatively lacking as well. The master weapons were garbage, the weapon/armor creation system was more annoying than it was useful. The Lord of the Land system was horrendously slow to level up and was area specific so you'd have to level up the Lord in every area to get the benefits. The character level system was all predetermined, no control.  The storyline was really basic which made it sort of anticlimactic. It wasn't an anticipated denuoment, it was an ""alright, let's get this over with."" The characters were all annoying which made the skits painful. It really just didn't do anything well and all the stuff I liked from previous games was absent."
1503,2,"This expansion pack (EP) was a complete wast of my time, and money.  It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor, some new spells and a couple new areas to explore.  There is no plot to the the EP, just some NPC saying  ""Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower. . . ."" and stuff like that.  The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a  lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate, and increased Experience points  to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level.  By the way, it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you  decide to replay Baldurs Gate.  In conclusion don't buy this EP, it isn't  worth it, unless any new EP's come out that require it."
1504,2,"Pros:
Great graphics!

Cons:
It's short (but I got bored and didn't bother to finish it).
Gameplay is too conventional and not really that innovative.
Not realistic:
- One man army
- Dumb enemy AI
- Lots of bullets
- Believe it or not, I can do stealthy sniping with my silenced pistol!!!

If you like FPS, it's worth a try.
But if realism matters so much, don't bother..."
1505,2,"Upon receiving this case I opened it up, pulled it out of the box, and my first reaction is. ""Hey, this feels like it will do a good job of protecting my $250 Vita!"" Well, I was extremely disappointed when I unzipped the case only to find out that all of that sturdy feeling I was feeling was actually the Styrofoam space-filler inside that you just throw away! My initial thought was that the case had rigid walls that would prevent it from being crushed, well it's just a padded case with no structure. It's better than nothing, but just barely. It does look nice with the PSVita logo on it, and I do take good care of my electronic devices, but it's far from the protection I thought I was getting. This should be a $10 item tops!"
1506,2,"When I first bought this game I was looking for an excellent battlefront game.  it was fun at first but later it just got boring.  The campaign is the worst i have ever played in a game.  Its short choppy and really easy.  You do the same thing in every level.  Besides that, the jedi suck.  Your lightsaber attacks are like swinging 2 inches.  Also it is really hard to move from place to place without falling of a ledge and landing in lava or whatever.  The grafics aren't a huge improvement.  The only good thing about the game is the loading time.

grafics: 3/5

loading time: 4/5

gameplay and fun (for me):2/5

campaign: 1/5 (this is were the game fails at miserably)

multiplayer: 2/5

  If I were you guys I would really buy other star wars games, like the force unleashed or renagade squaron."
1507,2,Dragon age 1 was a greate game this one...
1508,2,"I've played every Need for Speed game since the first one, and this version of Most Wanted wasn't too bad. The player can hop into any car available on the map (except for the ones that require money via DLC) and drive off, engaging in missions or running from the police. The graphics aren't too bad, but the physics engine is very arcadish not unlike the other NFS games. Unfortunately, technical issues like stuttering and horrible framerates really detract from the experience. I have an ATI HD Radeon 4870 that can run most games at a low resolution without any issues, but Most Wanted runs like a slug when there is a lot of motion/activity in the game. I tried keeping it capped at 30 fps, I tried removing the cap, I am running the latest version, etc... but the game is sluggish. I also play GTR, GTR2, GTR Evo, F1 2012, Borderlands 2, and a myriad of other games on this PC and everything flies. F1 2012 is absolutely glass smooth and that has a far more realistic physics engine. Need for Speed Most Wanted is just coded very poorly!

The poor choice of cockpit views also makes me mad. The default perspective has your car taking up most of the view, and it is difficult to see ahead in traffic and for judging distances/steering when maneuvering around traffic. Going to the other cockpit view sends you into a very low to the ground nose camera, which is better for steering but I can't see much of the traffic ahead.

The game also isn't fun when everything you run into causes a massive crash. The game isn't realistic to begin with, so why are they making a huge deal out of crashing especially when the intent of the game is to race illegally in a crowded city environment?

Forza Horizon did an outstanding job of racing through traffic... The graphics are insanely good, even on an Xbox 360, the framerate is stutter free, and the driving physics is great - and crashes aren't as big of a deal so the fun factor is kept high. If the Need for Speed franchise wants to survive beyond bargain bin gaming, they need to look at what their competitors are doing.

Overall: 2/5 stars. Could have been a really fun game, but the technical problems combined with a poor selection of cockpit views detracts from the fun factor. Luckily I picked up this game for 5 bucks, and even then I don't feel it was worth this amount."
1509,2,"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings brings us ever so deeper into the world of Hobbits and wizards. The game is design to be a RPG, but doesn't deliver. The game lacks aside elements that make a complete RPG. The game could of use more interactivity with the environment, more things to do(the game will take you about three hours to beat!) and the graphics are not up to X-Box par. With that, it does include the adventure with Willow and Todd Bonbadil which is a little good addition to the game overall, but is forgotten later in while you progress. Although it may lack in dept, it makes up with a fun engine, supposily a RPG, it reminds me of a  platform: Worriors of Might and Magic, a good game, but not great."
1510,2,"This game is bright and shiny and futuristic and not my cup of tea. It would probably be a lot more fun to play online, but I prefer to play FPS games by myself. The action is too directed for my tastes, but a great looking game anyway."
1511,2,This controller is very lightweight but it doesn't affect the game as must as the rumble (vibration). Great if you don't care about vibration. DO NOT get if you play Call Of Duty or similar games or it will affect your game.
1512,2,"The best thing BF1 has going for it is that it hasn't dropped into the futuristic abyss like the now-lame COD franchise...this game is fun if you have an abundance of patience...load times take 3-4 minutes...WAY too long...maps are WAY too big as you can spend 2-3 minutes just running to the area you want to be at only to be sniped by the dozen or more noobs laying prone...and repeat...when you do clear the prone campers there is no hardcore mode so it's basically just a noob sprayfest with very little strategy or skill involved...also, very uneven play as you can headshot someone 8 times in a row and they can turn around and kill you with one shot because their weapon is stronger than yours but...c'mon...8 headshots at pointblank doesn't kill someone? Lame. What's also lame is that at least half of players camp in and out of the out-of-bounds zones...skirting into OOB for the 10 seconds allowed, crossing into bounds for 1 second, entering back into OOB until finally camping JUST INSIDE the allowed boundary only to lay prone and snipe for the duration of the game...and how fun is that? Assault weapons only chip away at these noobs so without a hardcore mode, this game gets old fast.

On the positive side, the number of vehicles you can use is impressive and, if you can get past the 3 minute load time, the beginning of Operation maps usually provide vehicles that, if you're faster than a teammate, you can commandeer and use to rush forward to a marker...these vehicles usually end up getting destroyed quickly so the fun factor peaks at the beginning and only goes backwards from there.  So much better than COD...but that's not saying much these days."
1513,2,didn't work
1514,2,"I've had this mouse for quite some time now. This mouse is functional and works fine as a plain mouse. Where it fails is in the design category and it's a huge miss.
The scroll wheel is set too far back. If you position your hand to reach both sets of side keys you cant even use yhe scroll wheel because it is down below the joint on your middle finger. If you settle in to use the scroll wheel, you cant reach the second set of buttons. The angle on the back of the mouse is also stupid. The back, right of the mouse drops down and causes your hand to pull your thumb even further from the function buttons. All of this combines into a huge failure for me.
The mouse also frequently fails to pick up profiles regardless of OS version or software/firmware version."
1515,2,"Imagine Minecraft, pre-redstone.

That's about how good this game is, but with prettier graphics.

It's not Privateer, or Elite, or anything like that.  No trading.  No alien interaction.  No... anything other than mining. Crafting is lackluster.

I've had minimal crashes.

Don't buy this at full price."
1516,2,"the game is slow as hell, by time I finished loading my gun, I was dead and back at the command center.  you need good stuff for this game."
1517,2,"It works, but for a lot of games, you need to be about 2 feet away.  I recommend a Nintendo brand sensor bar"
1518,2,"Game loses two stars automatically when it freezes twice within the first half hour of game play. I don't care if there is a patch coming, tired of games being produced like this. Finish the product, then release."
1519,2,Boring.  Combat was cool for 5 minutes.  Then I was over it.
1520,2,"I was looking forward to this release. I had enjoyed Fallout 3 (didn't love it, but liked it), and was hoping this would be better. It wasn't. (NOTE: This review will contain spoilers).

The gameplay was pretty much the same -- which was good. That's one of the best things about the previous game, and this one as well. There were many aspects of this story that were average-ish, but others that were either contradictory, absolutely stupid, or annoying. Example (spoilers): the Legion path.

** LOTS OF SPOILERS **

Yes, the Legion. Because there is nothing more frightening than a bunch of futuristic guys dressing in skirts, err, ancient-esque tunics. And it's great armor, of course, to go around with bare legs. Stops bullets, I'm sure.
The Legion is a group of deranged fanatics, loyal to their leader Caesar (pronounced [by the Legion only] with a hard 'C')...who is an olive-skinned dude who sounds like he comes from the Bronx (and, as an Italian American, I have to admit, the stereotyping ticked me off; that, and, as an avid student and fan of [the real] Caesar, this bizarre fantasy rendition also fell short of the mark).
Caesar, when not running around crucifying people, burning his men who make mistakes and casting them off cliffs, and dressing his men up in fantasy historical garb, eventually contacts the player. Despite the fact that the Legion despises and brutalizes the ""weak"" and ""profane"" non-legionnaires, Caesar ends up putting you [a non-Legionnaire] in charge of critical projects.
For instance, he requests that you destroy Mr. House [the sort of despotic leader of the Vegas strip]'s bunker full of robots underneath the Legion's camp. Naturally, he doesn't send one of his own trusted legionnaires, but instead opts for a complete unknown. It gets way better though. He requests that you destroy them. I had been planning to upgrade the Securitrons (robots), kill Mr. House, and ally with the NCR and Brotherhood. So as to avoid fighting my way into Caesar's camp, I agreed to do as Caesar commanded...and then upgraded the bots. I expected to have to fight my way out of camp.
Nah. Instead, Caesar remarks that he heard the earth shake a few minutes ago, and figures that must have been the robots being destroyed. Nice. No need to check it out. I mean, why would such a paranoid stickler for order and rule-following actually double check the stranger's work? Why not take him at his word, right?
Things continue in this stupid vein for the whole game...when you kill Mr. House -- the guy who lives in an airtight, locked down, heavily guarded area that only HIS robots know about -- everyone somehow knows...because, of course, you're going to advertise that you murdered the town's leader, right? The factions that are already vying for control surely wouldn't see this as a good opportunity to make a move. Right. Also, if you put your robot in charge, both the NCR and the Legion know about it. Because they have spies everywhere. Even in the secret, heavily guarded Mr. House's ultra secure hidden chamber. Umm, yeah.
I eventually did end up killing Caesar by botching an operation (that is one of the options). If you play your cards right, the Legion doesn't attack you...these bastions of mercy (you know, the same legion that lit one of their fellows on fire and threw him off a canyon for losing a battle) threaten you, but then apologize (!!) and ask you to continue helping. Just to see how far this stupidity could go, I stripped Caesar in front of this high ranking Legionnaire (I forget his name, he's the one who hangs out in Caesar's tent all the time) of all of his armor and then donned it myself. Did they attack me? Did they confront me? Nah. So, I went around wearing Caesar's armor.
Also, if you try alternate paths...it's good to keep in mind that the Brotherhood of Steel has a very convenient self-destruct computer in their barracks in Hidden Valley. I don't know about you, but that would absolutely be something I'd include in my barracks' design. I mean, could you imagine a more useful feature? Me either...
Anyhow...these instances exemplify what was wrong with this game. Fallout 3 was hardly realistic or anything, but it was a lot of fun. New Vegas was annoying more than it was fun.
And don't get me started about the bugs. I don't know how many times the darn thing froze on me. I was seriously going to give up at one point.
All in all, this game had too many problems -- software wise -- and wayyyyy too many problems story and gameplay wise. 2 stars is being generous.

EDIT 11/28: made the spoiler note a little more prominent...sorry that it wasn't more clearly stated before!"
1521,2,"very cool with the lights. fun for the kids. Sorry just gave it for Christmas and it just quit in the middle of a game, my daughter informs me today Dec 30, 15 Not working, they live too far away so now I'm ordering a different brand. Sorry, not happy with this off brand."
1522,2,not  work  fine i need fix
1523,2,Returned. Did not play well on XBOXONE.
1524,2,"Heavy Rain is one of the most massively over-hyped games to be released in years on any platform.  I bought into the hype to the tune of $60, as anticipation of this game was one of the top reasons I finally purchased a PS3 over the past Holidays.  My overall opinion is that you should RENT this one first.

As you can read in most of the reviews posted here, this game definitely has sharp graphics, character animations, voice-acting, and music.  My response is, so what??  This is 2010, so any game that is not strong in these categories is pretty much dead in the water.  Giving praise to Heavy Rain for achieving what should be expected nowadays on the current generation of hardware seems a bit like holding a graduation ceremony after every grade of school, or giving the kiddies loser trophies to make them feel like winners.  Oh yeah, we do that now, don't we!!

The Quick Time Event (QTE) cut-scenes are very well-crafted for the most part, presenting much more lengthy and detailed button sequences than those presented in some recent games such as Resident Evil 4.  The QTE scenes reminded me of those awesome old-school Dragon's Lair and Space Ace arcade games, which I probably pumped over $50 worth of quarters into each as a kid.

My two largest issues with Heavy Rain are that its characters lack depth and substance, and that the story contains so many plot-holes that the narrative often became frustratingly nonsensical and hard to follow; at least it was for me.  These flaws can be overlooked in a button-mashing or first-person-shooter action game like God of War or Call of Duty, but it is completely inexcusable in a game that is presented as an interactive thriller / mystery like Heavy Rain.

As for lack of substance, depth or emotion in the characters, all you have to do is compare the actual Heavy Rain game with the mind-blowing ""Prototype: The Casting"" trailer that becomes available to you about halfway through the game as bonus material.  I'm talking about the trailer where Mary Smith the housewife talks directly to the camera in the kitchen.  It is absolutely amazing, but unfortunately, it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Heavy Rain game, nor is it anything like the actual game.  Funny how the Gamespot website uses Mary's image with the gun in her hand from that teaser trailer as the main screen shot for their Heavy Rain review page.  Lie much do you, video game mass media hype machine???

I looked on YouTube, and that Heavy Rain teaser came out almost 4 years ago.  It was clearly meant to deceive gamers into thinking that THIS is what Heavy Rain was actually going to offer in the department of character depth and emotion, something that would have rivaled, if not surpassed that of live-action movies.  Nope, sorry gamers, we gotcha good with the old bait and switch!!!

The most dreadful part of Heavy Rain is the multitude of gigantic plot-holes and broken narrative in the story.  The manipulation, deception and border-line lies on the part of the game-makers reminded me of the worst of David Fincher or M. Night Shamalama-ding-dong movies.  Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but you should not have to completely check your brain at the door before engaging in a psychological thriller such as ""The Game"", or ""The Sixth Sense"", nor should have you be forced to do so in a video game like Heavy Rain.

There may be a fine line between a red herring in a mystery story, and an unfair plot deception, but my opinion is that the makers of Heavy Rain went well out of their way to make the narrative unreasonable, and this severely detracted from the game experience for me.  I often found myself asking questions like, ""Why is this character here now, when it was a different character that just received the clue in the previous scenes?"" or ""How does this character even know that character?"" or ""How did this character do that horrible deed, when I was in control of them for all but a few seconds in that one particular scene??""

In summary, Heavy Rain boasts sharp graphics, animations, voice-acting and musical scores, and its QTE cut-scenes work well.  However, the lack of character substance and poorly-crafted story made this game overall a major let-down for me.  Playing this game was like pounding cool-looking square pegs into cool-looking round holes with a cool-looking hammer, while the pegs and hammer made cool sounds, and cool music was playing.  In other words, I found Heavy Rain to be relatively entertaining for a while, but ultimately for me, it was a pointless exercise, and a waste of about 10-12 hours.

This game is the perfect example of a title you should RENT FIRST, NOT BUY."
1525,2,yikes... final fantasy fans beware. this game is awful.
1526,2,"Being a fan of the Fatal Frame trilogy, I was excited for this game after Nintendo bought the rights to the series but disappointingly passed on bringing Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse (Wii) to America; at least there would be some consolation by having the 3DS iteration brought over here...right?

There really is not much fun to be had. The 'game' involves two gameplay elements: flipping through the included AR booklet to find the right page to aim your 3ds camera at to advance the story, the other is gyroscope-based combat against ghosts, turning round and round to get the enemy in your sights.  No exploration of a haunted mansion or village, nothing like that from traditional Fatal Frame's past iterations.

The backdrop of the narrative portions is your own house, so while speaking to your spirit friend Maya or battling an evil ghost, you'll see such haunting background visuals as your kitchen stove or your cat or dog snoring on the couch next to a family member in your living room with the tv playing a rerun of Family Guy or something. It really destroys the suspension of disbelief that is necessary for a horror game. Again, the past games have provided an appropriate setting for a horror game (i.e a Japanese village or house) but Spirit Camera depends on your own place to create the atmosphere. Terrible. Are we supposed to go out of our way to find an abandoned building to play this game to get the proper atmostphere? Arent we paying $40 for the game to provide those things to the user? Again, because of this there is nothing to explore. You can even walk around. I think the player is supposed to be an immobile camera sitting on a tripod and not a human being with legs to walk around? Seems that way to me.

Tecmo's original idea was to do a 3ds enhanced remake of the original Fatal Frame, but Nintendo Japan's president rejected the idea and opted for this half-baked tech demo-y thing instead. Way to give a bad impression of one of gaming history's few worthwhile horror series to the faithful fans who (I think) this game was aimed for...

Other trivialities: the game can be finished in about 2 hours, and for some reason one of the bonus outfits is censored from the original Japanese version. Why have a T rating if the content doesnt exercise it? The game is really an E for everyone game."
1527,2,I bought this game thinking I could use the ps3 move joy stick but you can't you have to play with the regular joy sticks
1528,2,This quit working two months after we purchased it. It just quit charging anything at all.
1529,2,"Out of the gate, for those of you who loved the first part of this adventure ""Sherlock Holmes: Awakened"" - this second chapter is `nothing' like the first.  In `Awakened' the storyline and mood was very dark (something that I look for in a point and click game), this second/sequel is nowhere near dark and though it's really fun to bump into some of the old characters from the first game and stroll through familiar area's, ""Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis"" just didn't have the flair that the first game did.  I stopped playing half way through (even with a walkthrough) and started playing ""Darkness Within"".
1) The scripting & dialog were very good, the voice acting was well done
2) Graphics performed well and the environment had zero glitches
3) Overall performance of the game to include installation was solid
4) Storyline was good but was too cat & mouse with the villain; not enough horror.  Was expecting a darker theme due to the first chapter of the 2 part series, nixed a star for this.
5) Clues, hints, and adaptability to continue game play was harsh (for sure requires a walkthrough; nixed this star due to many clues being too obscure."
1530,2,EA and Origin are pretty evil. If you plan on buying this for PC or MAC don't buy it used. You can't play they game without a code and if it's used the code most likely won't work. I love this game on Xbox but this is BS.
1531,2,"This game graphic is good compared to other Wii games. I like the fighting scenes even though they're short. It might be because I'm not a hard cored gamer. However, the frustrating control makes this game boring after 2 missions. For example, while I was in a car form, I could not  reverse! I had to transform into the robot to go backward. While fighting, a lot of times I moved the Wii remote as instructed by the manual but I got no response!

After playing it for 45 minutes, I gave up. I saved $27 dollars by renting it."
1532,2,"The game play is fair. However, the plot and the dialog suffer from a distinct lack of polish. As a result, I found myself caring very little for the protagonist and Hel's plot to use the protagonist as a tool against Lenneth seemed completely arbitrary.

If a decent story is important to you in your games, pass on this game and look at some of the main entries in the Valkyrie Profile franchise.

If average game play coupled with pretty good (for the DS) visuals is important to you, then this game will satisfy your itch."
1533,2,"Was a defect in it. Movement is stuck slightly to the right, I have to push left on the controllr to make it stop. Every time I press right though it keeps going right slightly. This is apparently a known issue with these super overpriced 360 controllers. This is again, another reason why I switched to PC gaming. I'll leave console gaming for my son."
1534,2,"Taken in tiny chunks Bioshock 2 is, on a purely superficial level, almost indistinguishable from the first game. The graphics and fast-twitch combat are just as good as the first game, it's a competent shooter with an inherently cool setting, and it does make a handful of tangible improvements over its predecessor - like being able to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously, and some improved water effects. But it doesn't really rise above its predecessor so much as it tries a little too hard to copy its most successful elements, and never really finds a voice of its own.

Gameplay is straightforward, to the point of being simplistic; it's pretty much a run around and shoot things game, which works fine to a point, but the game is also stuffed full of padding - mostly the sub-missions where you guard Little Sisters while they harvest Adam, which start out harrowing but quickly get repetitive and dull. A handful of levels are total knockouts (one memorable one involves escaping a building while it's in the process of flooding, in what feels like real time), and the weakest levels are still competently done. A handful of new enemies liven things up, in a way, mainly by having annoying special abilities that make them harder to kill. In terms of gameplay it's a competent game, really, with a few standout points of excellence. Bioshock 2 just doesn't really bring anything *new* to the table, and doesn't improve on the existing stuff enough to make much of an impact. And even with all the padding it's still a surprisingly short game.

The real problem with Bioshock 2, though, is the story and plot elements. The first game had all the same flaws as the sequel (except perhaps the repetitiveness), but the straightforward on-the-rails shooter elements were disguised behind an absolutely masterful loyalty to the themes of the plot. All layers of the game - the vending machines, the insane splicer enemies, the creepy Little Sisters, the ubiquitous journal recordings, the characters themselves - were direct reflections of the central themes of the game. All the characters - even the insane ones - had their own motivations and objectives, and the conflict in the plot even down to individual levels always came from variations on those same central themes. That, coupled with an exceptionally strong opening and some truly creepy environmental design, made for a deeply involving game. Bioshock was scary and threatening and made the player feel constantly in danger, even though it was next to impossible to actually lose, and that was what made it work.

Bioshock 2, on the other hand, trades in the thematic elements in the plot that supported the atmosphere for new central themes - what sounds like a mushy version of Socialism and a take on fatherhood that's difficult to relate to. There are a few good minor surprises, but the game's story just feels forced, and none of the characters - including the PC - ever really came alive. Without any sense of connection with the characters, the game lost any particular sense of urgency, and even the game's legitimately well-done attempts at creepiness and horror mostly just sort of fizzled. There are also a few glaring logical flaws inherent in the premise of the game - it's set ten years after the first one, which means there's really no explanation for how exactly Rapture still has unlooted containers, people or even air still in it, considering the condition it was in in the first game. It also undermines the sense of imminent doom that Bioshock 2 tries to emulate from the original game, where it felt like the city was going to literally collapse around you at any moment; after all, it's lasted ten years with conspicuous leaks in every room and no discernible food sources, and you're playing as a nigh-invulnerable tank.

And of course, the control scheme is an annoyingly direct remapping of console controls. The only nod to the PC's vastly more versatile control options are weapons hotkeys; you can't even scroll in menus using the arrow keys. It mostly didn't bother me outside of trying to use vending machines, but there's really no excuse for game companies to continue using such awkward interfaces for game menus on a PC.

I also have to mention that the game has some deeply annoying copy protection systems, not least of which is the still-broken Games for Windows Live. I have yet to play any game with GFWL where the program actually works with any consistency, and Windows Live managed to keep my version of this game unplayable for the first two days thanks to mandatory login and overtaxed servers. There's also Securom and limited activations to contend with. If the game had opt-in Windows Live and a disc check instead, I'd be able to recommend it, if only to shooter fans... but this game is simply not worth the DRM issues it creates. I wouldn't have bought it myself if I'd thought to do the research beforehand on the DRM it came with.

Overall, I can't shake the feeling that there's a great game hiding somewhere under Bioshock 2. But it's bogged down by needlessly padded gameplay, a lack of engagement with the setting and plot, and a few gaping plot holes. It's not a bad game, and shooter fans will find something to enjoy in it, but it just doesn't live up to its predecessor... even to the point that it's unlikely anyone going back later to replay the first game will miss anything they added for the sequel. It's a good game, but it's far from a great game, and once you factor in the disastrous DRM it's just not worth buying."
1535,2,Not too impressed with the overall quality.  The controllers pop out pretty easily and the left charger broke after a week.
1536,2,"this thing is garbage, it performs like crap, it locks up all the time and has to be updated constantly, I threw it away and plugged in my old logitech mouse ...works great.

update: 06/04/2017, the mouse pad took a crap but really it was crap out of the box, the software is horrible always has driver errors, plus it updates every couple of days without fixing anything at all."
1537,2,So I put these on my controller before using it. I used them for a while and didn't feel empowered or improved. So I took them off. WOW I got much better performance with the plain control sticks. Cant recommend unless your trying to hinder yourself to improve once you take them off. try the FPS kontrolfreaks instead.
1538,2,"The maps are ugly and tired.  The exoskeleton does not really change much, one just jumps further and can dodge faster.  The mechanics are more frustrating than fun.  Why design maps with areas that it looks like one can jump to but cannot?  For the areas one can jump to with the exoskeleton, I frequently seem to just miss my jumps. I'm not the only one after spectating for a few hours on S&D.  The amount of exoskeleton jump does not match the terrain, the flow is very awkward.

I suppose the producers of the game wanted to appeal to both audiences of run/camp/shoot and the new genre of ""unrestricted movement"".  Unfortunately, the movement is really restricted.  Not much fun to use the exoskeleton.  The Second COD in a row where it feels more like work than fun.

This could have been a good game if there was some creativity and risk put into developing the maps.  Instead it is the usual ""competitive maps"" that make you feel like your playing every other COD Modern Warfare game.  This will be the second COD game in a row where I will not buy any DLC."
1539,2,"Upon arrival, I can hear a small ""something"" rattling around inside the mouse, like a loose screw.  It has not affected the performance of the mouse as of yet but it does not instill a great deal of confidence in the product.

The mouse comes with six removable weights inside which I don't think is mentioned on the Amazon product page.  This is a nice feature since the mouse is all plastic and very light without them.  In fact, I find that the mouse is a bit too light at the front as all the weight sits at the back of the mouse.  This makes fast precision movements a bit problematical.

In the Amazon description the company claims ""non slip"" grip.  This is a bit misleading as the mouse is made of hard plastic so even though it has texture in places, the slightest bit of sweat makes the mouse slippery to hold.  Tecknet really missed an opportunity here.  There is a strip across the top (palm rest) where the interior lighting shows through.  It's textured to look like a mesh cutout but is in fact just semi clear plastic.  If they would  have actually put holes here that would of at least allowed some airflow to keep your hands cool.  (I also may have been able to see what's rattling around inside).

I find the mouse to be super sensitive which is good and bad.  The good is high precision, quick movement.  The bad is that the lowest setting for dpi is 500.  This is still a bit too quick (at least for me) for precision aiming in games.  I think the RAT7 mouse I had has a low setting of 300 dpi or less, which is excellent.  As to the software (included on one of those mini disks, as well as instructions), it is easy and intuitive to use.  There are lots of lighting options such as ""breathing"", always on, etc.  And multiple color choices.  I do like that when you ""on the fly"" change the dpi settings, the whole mouse changes color to reflect that fact so it's easy to visually see when you've made the change.  There is a tab in the software that says ""Support"".  This does not actually lead to anything but a picture of the mouse.  No email options or anything actually support related.

There is a thumb button under the back and forward buttons which in the software is set as ""three click"".  I don't know what that means.  On most mice, this button is a sniper button which really slows mouse movement so you can get precise shots.  In game, I find that, set as it came, it just acts as a fire button.  If I was in something that could fire 3 shots fast maybe it would do that?  As is I'm having to either turn the button off or set it as something that won't screw up my games as there is no sniper setting that I can find.  It's placement is also a bit off since it sits pretty much right under your thumb so if you just squeeze a bit, you've pressed it.  Miss-clicks abound.

The buttons to change dpi are below the mouse wheel which is normal but the lower dpi button is pretty skinny and is recessed between the mouse buttons which makes it a bit difficult to accurately press in the heat of the moment.

It has a nice braided cable which is plenty long enough.  The cable is very stiff though and requires some ""breaking in"" time.  Also, as I mentioned, the front of the mouse is very light which means the stiff cable can tend to move your mouse around when you remove your hand from it.  Not always the optimal thing to happen in a game.

This is a very good mouse, so far, for the price.  It does feel quite cheap in your hand but that's what you paid for (less money, less quality).  It does look very nice.

Update 06Sep17:
I have to say that Tecknet has been very helpful and proactive with their support.  They have contacted me several times for further information and very proactive support.  Of course, this does not change my review of the actual product, but I thought it worth mentioning.

Update 22Sep17:
So now this mouse has gotten in the habit of randomly disconnecting from the computer.  Sometimes it will reconnect itself in a few seconds, sometimes I have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it working again.  Shopping now for another new mouse.  Subtracting another Star."
1540,2,"I wish i could rate this 2 1/2 star. I don't know maybe 2 stars is enough. The game is worse than i expected. I didn't expect it to be that good, but it turned out a lot worse than what i had expected. This is more of an online game, everything is based online. Here are the pros and cons to make it easier:

Cons:
- way to dark!!! the whole thing is way to dark and there is no way to actually adjust it. Its hard to see anything so it makes the game sort of unplayable.
- No 2 player!! Really capcom?? why when RE5 had 2 player. That's not much fun seeing how it takes forever to find someone to match up with and most of the time you can't find anyone!!
- Story isn't that good. (kinda unbelievable) why does nemesis in parts look like a robot instead of something extremely terrifying? even the lickers don't look as scary anymore. The brains on the outside just don't do it for me. expected something better (not that many scenes). IT honestly doesn't really feel like a resident evil game and i played every last one that came out on game cube before getting a ps3.
-AI is really stupid. its really annoying to have 4 partners that don't do anything. It's bad when its 1 but 4? Most of the time they are running around getting killed leaving you to go in the open to try and heal them because you need back up and it ends up putting you in a bad spot.
-herbs and first aid don't heal like they used too. Unless you have the medic Bertha the first aid won't get you full like it used to in the previous resident evils which makes this game suck even more...
- Did i mention one of the worst parts is no 2 player? I would rather have someone playing beside me that i know instead of having someone online or the stupid computer to always rely on...
- weapons suck. hardly make any impact. worse weapons by far. I even pre-ordered this and had an extra weapons added on but they all suck so it was pointless anyways. even the extra costume pack that came with the game sucked cause all it did was change the costume color not the costume itself....
- no item organization which makes it annoying and really feel like its not a RE game. IT also makes it one of the worst parts in the game. They were really lazy on this one... I have to constantly drop my weapon to pick up another one to use for the time being than try and find my weapon somewhere on the ground. No more can i switch between weapons so i don't have to carry the same two weapons all the time. no more can i assign a different weapon to one of the keypad slots like i used too. If resident evil 6 turns out like this you can count me out!!!

Pros
The graphics are a bit better more realistic looking, but that's about it. there are NO improvements in this game.

In the End, I really wish i would have never pre-ordered this game. Another game that got me all hyped up only to let me down (hint ssx).
I will be renting before buying again because i don't want to have to go through this again. There are so many cons to this game im pretty sure im not getting to them all because im so upset. I haven't said anything about the multiplayer as far as versus go because i don't like to play RE games online so as far as online play go im not rating just only the campaign. oh yeah another con to this game is that there are TOO many online trophies which makes it hard to plat. I love plating the games i play and this one is beyond me..... That really annoys me too. I will be trading this one in asap.

Another con - when i say weapons make no impact i mean they literally don't. i can shoot a human in the face 10 times and they won't go down. I can shoot a zombie 3 and they fall no problem? why is it easier to kill a Zombie than a Human? That makes no sense!!! why does it take like 20 shots just to take someone down??"
1541,2,"I own this game, and it doesn't come close to its original (Harvest Moon 64)!  In Save the Homeland, you can't get married, there are no sheep, no festivals, no babies, the game ends after 1 year of play, you must work for a horse, and there aren't many fields to grow crops!  I must say though, the graphics are the best I have ever seen!  But I didn't think the graphics were worth the price for the game.  So, my opinion is, Don't get it!  If you don't have Harvest Moon64, spend your money on that!"
1542,2,"Not sure where they were going with this. I started the campaign then totally lost interest, and for the love of all that's holy, YES we know ""Train go Boom"" you only hear that line 100 times, we get it. OK the story, you get your arms ripped off by a robot and they rebuild you, didn't they have a TV show in the 70's about this? So they stick crap in your brain so you can hallucinate with others in a dream world where you have guns. you start reliving someones dream or reality trying to learn what happened. The Windows 8 team strikes again! Way to mess this up as well. I've lost interest in the campaign, it is going no where for me and is so not fun. Let's try multi player ........ What the #$%#@ is this? I'm some 14 year old with a bow? I keep hearing some 14 year old telling me things are ready, Is this Rugrats Hug time game or something? Your a kid with a bow, and as you level up you get a player that is slightly older,  Till finally your a robot. I could not make this up if I tried. They say before the first week out this game made 500 Million, WHY??!!! Did they count all of the Xbox 360 returns? This game has taught me NEVER PREORDER Wait till people write reviews like this so you can make up your own mind, Not that ""Gamer Monthly"" gave this game 4.7 out of 5 stars. And Butt Muncher Weekly ""Best Game EVER"" Don't believe the hype, believe your peers, friends and reviewers. Black ops 2 puts this game to shame hands down. I feel like I'm playing Titanfall without the big robot. They did not need to over think this game as they did. And I do not care if you agree with me or not, I would rather play Ghosts than this game."
1543,2,A game where challenges come from the fact that the main character is programmed to run slower than an asthma sufferer and his gun to shoot paper wads making enemies immortal can`t score more than 2 amazon stars.
1544,2,"Honestly, not my first Kotion headset, yet certainly my last. The first one, had a mic that failed to be recognized properly and the output was so low (even on high playback setting which otherwise would blow others ear off) that it was nonexistant. This one however, did not even work at all. Appearance wise and comfort? 9/10 That 1 point off just because of how well it snugs onto you and clings. Audio quality was passable. At this point, just going to stay on the safe side and just keep with Turtle beach (almost never any issues there >_>)"
1545,2,"It works when it's not falling out of my SP. The headphone jack clinches my headphone connector like it's holding on for dear life. On the other end, the SP connector falls out whenever it feels like it. Volume and sound quality are fine."
1546,2,I gonna say it fast... don't expected great graphics of this game only cuz is in ps4 go and buy the ps3 versin and save some $...
1547,2,"Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z may in fact be the worst DBZ game on the PS3/X360. To begin with, the most obvious thing wrong with the game is the simple fact that there is NO OFFLINE VS MODE! I kid you not. What's one of the most important things about a fighting game? Being able to play in VS mode! The only way to fight someone (other than in the bland, scripted story mode where you can't control who you fight) is to play online. How could they mess this up this bad? What's so wrong with having an offline VS mode against the computer? Nothing, that's what. And that's just the beginning of a long list of things wrong with this game. The next big issue is the limited character roster and not being able to transform (go super saiyan) during battle. Mix that with extremely stale flying and fighting controls, and you have one huge let down. I mean, all the melee moves are controlled entirely by one button (that's what you want in a fighting game, right?). And only 8 characters have ultimate moves to top it off. All in all, this game is a let down by all means of the words. DO. NOT. BUY. IT."
1548,2,Take forever to charge. The charging station is kind of dinky.
1549,2,I can confirm the peeling issue
1550,2,"I believe this is not as good as compared to the Sidewinder that Microsoft makes.  It is a very clumsy controller.  It may look like a dual shock playstation controller but by no means does it perform up to the standards of the playstation controller. I got it for(X)and I sold it already for (X) . I tried the Sidewinder and thought it was a better controller and as the old saying goes, "" You get what you Pay for."""
1551,2,Halo called and they want their game concept back. This game does itself a disservice by coming out annually instead of bi-annually. It's almost like the designers run out of ideas so they just steal from other games. I will probably play this for a bit and then go with battlefield 1 or whatever.
1552,2,"terrible keyboard. keys are very sticky, and already squeaking after owning the keyboard for about 5 months. i do not recommend this keyboard."
1553,2,"But a game? Sure if it was done right.. Horrible port.
Max Res of 1024x768?? what is this, 1998?

This was a great idea for a game and more time and effort should have been put into it. Alt history games are really a blast. Unfortunately, I wish I would have passed this one by."
1554,2,"I don't understand all the positive reviews of this game, it has not lived up to the hype.
My biggest negative (and there are a lot of them) is that isn't intuitive. You get thrown into fights after long movie sequences, die, then have to go through the same sequence again. This happens frequently that there are no game-save opportunities and you have limited time to do the exact proper sequence to win a battle. Typically you have to do a major quest before moving on and there are limited minor quests to get points to level up. Several occasions I had to go into easy mode to get past a specific quest otherwise your stuck there running around not gaining any ground. I hate having to do that.

The maps are terrible and have no real use, the quest pointer isn't well thought out and pretty much useless too.
Somebody wrote that the quests are dull, I agree for the most part. Find and fetch, kill some rodents, bugs and annoying people.

Finally, I just don't give a crap about the pasty skinned central character in any way, nice that he gets to screw a couple times but WTF is that all about?

Not a great game in my opinion."
1555,2,"Auto modelista is a huge let down as far as racing sims go with only one saving grace. The thing that matters the most in a videogame is the core gameplay, length, and replay value, and auto modelista falls flat on its face in all three categories.
First of all the core gameplay. The game has very short, unmemorable tracks, which is really a shame because the graphics are excellent. The cars drive terribly, powerslide around every turn. As for the car selection, the game consists mostly of uninspired import cars, and the occasional viper or corvette.
As for the length of this game, it took me roughly 3 hours to beat, which is laughable compared to the 35 hours i have on final fantasy 10, and im still nto even close to done! The longest race is 4 or 5 laps long across a tin race course, really the load times took more than the race time most of the time.
As for the replay value, once you beat the game, your done, might as well use this game for kindling in your fire place. Yes, it does feature online game play, but  it is terribly uninspired, and just as boring and brief as the offline expierience.
So what is the one saving grace of this game? The pretty graphics of course! Through all of the flaws the light of graphics does gleam through on this not so shiny gem. Customizing your car is extremely entertaining, and finding all the perfect tones of paint for your car. There is also a wide array of stickers, and a custom sticker maker. The down side of the sticker maker is that it is no where near user friendly, and a tutorial would have been VERY helpful.
In conclusion your money is much better spent elsewhere. This is the kind of title that comes out terrible, then the sequel unexpectedly blows you away, so lets just keep our fingers crossed that if there is an aut modelista 2, they completely overhaul the terrible controls and make the races MUCH longer!"
1556,2,"We've gone through two of these, within 2 years, same problem, sholder buttons not working.  Anyway, we were going to return this and get a new one, it was then I realized that the metllic was on clearance and no other ds lite was, this leads me to believe that all ds metallics are defective.  I had a Onyx ds lite and it held up for 3 years of beatings.  The ds metallic can't stand 1 year."
1557,2,"I played this many years ago (2002) when it was first released and got stuck about midway thru the game on a mission where I kept getting mowed down by a machine game nest in an alley. I got tired of repeating that level over and over ad nauseam and I stopped playing.

Last week (2015), looking for some single-player FPS action on my trusty old PS2, I decided to revisit this game on NORMAL difficulty. The controls are completely wonky. NO sensitivity settings? WTH? The character moves way too slowly when moving and aiming. Now I know why I put it down many years ago.

EXAMPLE: Early in the game, my character was trapped in a corner with absolutely no escape. Maybe I can jump? Nope. Move left, right, forward, backward? Nope. I'm stuck. Hard. I had to reset the level. In the submarine mission, I was continually spraying the same narrow corridor with a German MP40 submachine gun and I had to unload 2 clips just to kill 5 Nazis. Gee, I had no idea machine guns were so bloody ineffective on enemy soldiers at close-range. LOL. I kept getting mowed down over and over again by the same 5 Nazis with no escape and no defilade while my character slowly reloaded his heavy duty NERF gun. Hurry up, grandpa! I made it thru at least 4 times with only a drop of life left, only to be mowed down again in another narrow corridor farther on up the road by another 5 Nazis with still no defilade and no effective close-range weapon. By the 5th and 6th try my character's view snapped up at the ceiling and started to spin around and around and around while those dirty Kraut sailors annihilated me. Stuck again? Staring up at the ceiling? WTH? NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE! I guess the generals forgot to supply me with some Dramamine before I got on this crazy U-boat. LOL. Forget it. Who's got the time when I could be playing something fun. This game is an exercise in futility. Shameful beta testing.

I had no problem beating MOH 1 & 2 on the old PS1 and had a great time playing those games. But, this franchise was ruined when they made this wonky MESS the 3rd game in the MOH platform series. Unless you're a glutton for punishment stay far far away. If you have to play it, set it on EASY. That's what I'm doing now just to rip thru it and see what the rest of it looks like. (ARGH! I just shot Wernher von Braun with the sniper rifle 3 times in the head and he won't go down. He's still scribbling rocket fuel formulas on his little pad. I guess the generals gave me blanks because they want to use him at the end of the war. lol. PAINFUL.)

They say that WAR is HELL, but this game is like being stuck in PURGATORY!

It gets 2 stars for the level design, weapons choice, weapons sound effects, soundtrack, and the dying Nazi animations. Everything else about this game is just plain awful.

If you need a break from all the multiplayer FPSs on the newer platforms and you're looking for a great old single-player FPS experience for your good old PS2, get BLACK (superior) or KILLZONE (great). Those games ROCK!

This game SUCKS a Nazi Potato Masher!"
1558,2,"Having heard all of the bashings on RTS games for consoles, I was not expecting much.  However, this game was impossible to play.  I plowed through a dozen missions just because 1) I like Tim Curry and 2) there was a lot of cleavage in the cut scenes.  Unfortunately, the novelty soon wore off and I plan on never ever playing this game again."
1559,2,"Some flaws and bad graphics for a $29.99 game when it should be in the $15 to $20 range. With owning the PS4 system, I expect the graphics and game play to be flawless, or as close to it as possible. I think the porting from the PC version to the next gen systems was a bad idea. The decent 2D choppy graphics weren't very good, the zombies weren't very good, and having the game lag a few seconds, whether you are playing online or not is unacceptable for me. I understand when I play online, that I do expect a delay once in awhile. And the movement went slow, I wasn't able to run, or even walk fast. Plus your choice of people to play as wasn't good either. Same type of person, just different clothing. I do love the fact that the game was more involved, by building things and your house, but I just couldn't get over everything else. So off to the store I went to return it.
At least with the older Resident Evil games, they have much better graphics, and you can get them at a more reasonable price."
1560,2,"Looks great and all but I have a few issues with this keyboard.
1.  The lights shut off after a period of non-use... which is fine if my pc was running on batteries... but the problem with this is when you go to type something again, you can't see the keyboard letters.  you have to hit a key for it to light up again.  When it's not lit, you can't make out ANY letters or numbers or anything... they are just all black.  Why is that a good idea when a pc doesn't run on batteries?
2.  The macro keys do not record mouse movements or anything like that.  It will only record key presses on the keyboard.
3.  No instructions for setting up the mail shortcut button.  It just simply opens the browser... like the Home key.  So whats the point?
4.  Enter key is too narrow...  I keep hitting the slash key.
5.  this is the first keyboard i ever owned that had the function key on the right side instead of the left.... so that is confusing.
6.  All the macro keys are on the left.  So Im constantly hitting them when meaning to hit shift, Ctrl, Tab, Esc, Etc.
7.  No point in even having the legs that flip out under the back since it only raises the keybord by about a half a centimeter.
8.  Some of the keys don't light up as well as the others ...so the minute you get it, it looks like you've done been using it for a year... cause it kind of resembles having faded key letters and numbers in some areas.

Some Pros to mention
1.  Nice to be able to switch the lights so that they are steady on one color or fade between all of them.  Plus the option to have it change colors can be where they fade from one color to the next or just changes quickly from one to the next.
2.  Ya... can't really think of anything else.  Exept maybe that it works.  What else can I say?"
1561,2,"This game is not good, it was OK. The biggest complain is that it Froze my brand new PS3 three times the same afternoon :("
1562,2,I like the ocasinal shooter game. Halo 2 is one shooter game for me is not fun. I didn't enjoy this game as much as I would of. The graphics are amazing but the controls were too hard. If you like the first halo get this game. But I'll get Day of Reckoning.
1563,2,its kind of a weak story line.  game-play is more awful than than the new duke nukem ... its not a free roam fps game like halo.
1564,2,This game is not for me
1565,2,"... when they realize they shelled out ($) for a game they finish in about 7 or 8 hours. Good graphics (not AWESOME... just good), but the controls can be tricky. You can complete it in the span of a 5-night rental at Blockbuster."
1566,2,"It holds vita games so you don't have to...with your hands. Get it?

Pros:
Conversation Piece
Plays Netflix if you haven't bought a device since 2006

Cons:
Vita with no screen
Vita with no accelerometer
Vita with no memory card
Vita with no controller
Vita with no full Vita library
Takes up an HDMI port better used on anything else"
1567,2,My wife and I didn't like it.
1568,2,If you pick Tiger in the game against others. He's got the advantage over other players. which isn't fair.
1569,2,On a rail the whole time.  Poor AI. Gets very boring quickly.  Not sure if I can force myself to finish.
1570,2,"As a child I LOVED these games. King's quest 7 is my favorite which is why I bought this. However, make sure your computer is compatible because I have spent the last 2 hours trying everything I can to get the games to work with no luck. I will change this review if I ever get the game to work.

UPDATE: Hours later I have even managed to get my hands on Window 98. Still no luck."
1571,2,"What is the purpose of making a keyboard even louder than cherry mx blue and harder to press?  It's tactile, meaning you don't have to press all the way to the bottom, but because it has almost double the required force of something like browns or romer-gs, you are going to be bottoming these things out and causing so much sound you won't be able to think straight without headphones. WTF is the point?  Luckily I got mine for 25 bucks at walmart and am ordering some o rings, but seriously is this for droolers who have to bang every key already... with hearing problems?"
1572,2,Lack of story mode and a campaign that walks you through the game really made me drop this game after 45 minutes. Needed an introduction like Borderlands had.
1573,2,The game I got skips and has very little gameplay. I would look around for something else if you are deciding on a new game.
1574,2,"Never having played the original Two Worlds, and seeing the rather virulent hatred or defense of this, I figured I had to give this a stab. I expected a Oblivion-esque free world RPG setup, which is essentially what it is. However, development and display is where this totally trips over its own two feet, and its a real shame.

Graphics are rather nice. I keep hearing comparison to Ps2 graphics,and while its true that the polish is not up to current spec, it makes up in depth what it lacks in detail. Creatures are almost WYSIWYG, very difficult to do if you're planning on making eq drops nearly random. However, there are so many clipping and coloring errors that its hard to go more than a few minutes without encountering some.

Audio is almost rather decent. Your character needs to lighten up a little, as he sounds nearly robotic with some of his delivery, as if he's expecting to strangle you and your little dog too during every conversation

Control and HUD display is where this starts to be completely crippled. Setting up your controls is painful and while quite a few controls are actually rather well put together (same button controls crawl and sprint, for instance) others are extremely ham handed. Targeting is a struggle, and certain item classes are bizzarely handled for how they appear in the inventory. It almost looked like they were trying to go for a Demon's Souls control scheme, which would've worked beautifully had they used it.

Story and characters are where this starts to die. In the opening sequence, Enemy General fights Friendly General, and beats him. And rather than kill him, cripple him, or even wound him, he spouts off an Evil Overlord quip and turns away, allowing Friendly General to kill him. I actually had to turn off the game and restart it, as my brain refused to believe something so trite and dated could happen in a game that otherwise appeared to take itself seriously. And while the advancement scheme is at least somewhat original, its so poorly executed that its a struggle to find your way through the maze of skill advancements.

Characters at least seem interesting, but the conversation scheme is bizzare it its setup, as you only have two dialogue choices, which 4 or more relevant options. Some characters have outfits so hackneyed and overdone that they're completely ridiculous, and its a struggle to interact with.

Further hurting chances are the absolute deluge of glitches. Graphical, audio, handling, and freezes abound.

Overall, this had some serious promise, completely obliterated by aspects of the delivery that totally ruin suspension of disbelief, as well as the feel that you're playing in an epic. A major overhaul of certain scenes and interface could change this from 2 stars to 4.5, but without a serious polishing, this is clearly still a beta game. Truly, a shame."
1575,2,worked for about a month and battery died. gave cable to family member who had an xbox so i guess it all worked out.
1576,2,"I had very high hopes for this game and went out to buy it as soon as it came out.  Now that I've been ""playing"" it I have some major gripes...

This game is beyond what I would call linear, you are confined to a set path, unlike KOTOR where you ran around zones, here you run down paths.  Dreadful.

Combat looks stupid.  All the fights seem predetermined.  When you enter combat a large loud annoying ""start of combat"" screen pops up.  You decide your attack, you execute your attack, then you run back to where you were to stand like an idiot waiting on the enemy to attack you.  I just can't get over how bad that looks.

What it boils down to is that there is little to no exploration and all the game is is a series of battles you run too.  Rent this thing if you have to play it."
1577,2,"unplayable at this time, I would give the gave 4 stars if it was playable and with time they will fix it(i hope) but for now its a 2 start game at best.
stutters, glitches, booting issues, unable to log on to server, all the standard mmo start up issues in spades."
1578,2,I bought this for retro gaming. I don't think the gameplay holds up.
1579,2,"I've always loved the Resident Evil series, but this game just fell flat.  It was an uninspired game.  It just didn't have what made the others great.  It was rather boring and the play control was a bit clunky."
1580,2,no comment
1581,2,Shoot everything. Collect the loot. Repeat. There might be a story but I was too bored to keep playing past a couple hours.
1582,2,"This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one.  I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time!  The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)!  The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog?  Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?!  Plus why can't I push the A button?  I swear.  Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)!
Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know!  However this is a cool color though, so I gusse that count's for something!  Otherwise I don't recomend!  Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!"
1583,2,Only had a few months and my 6 year old already broke it. 3ds games are hard to get in and out.
1584,2,"Best graphics of any PS4 game, hands down.  The game itself? It's a disappointment.  Online only, no campaign.  Do yourself a favor, just play the old battlefront on PS2; far better game."
1585,2,"This product is unreliable third-party hardware. I suggest you buy the official Nintendo Expansion Pak that will NOT ruin your N64 like the one on this page is said to do. If you value the life of your console and games, use the official Pak and not the generic hardware advertised on this page. Most people won't notice by looking at the picture, but the official Nintendo Pak has a circle pattern in the red top portion unlike the parallel slits in this image. If you aren't familiar with the official Pak, it is very easy to see the image and think it's the official thing. Make sure you either purchase one on Ebay where you can see the pictures of the actual item you're purchasing. Or read the Amazon Seller's item description very carefully before buying to make sure they explicitly claim you are buying the official Nintendo brand Pak.

I post this only because this page is misleading, making you think you are purchasing the official Nintendo Expansion Pak, which you are not."
1586,2,"A huge selection of cars is only awesome when the selection does not include 10 variations of the same car. I am not speaking yearly entries either. Their huge lineup of vehicles is greatly supplemented by multiple entries of the exact same car with different configurations, things you would normally do yourself in experimenting with setups. This in itself is reason enough for disliking this game but there are even more reasons. Previous generations of this game were oftentimes delayed by many years to make improvements over previous iterations, this one does not. Sure the controls are great but everything else about the game is iffy at best. There is still no real vehicle damage models, something that was perfected back in the Dreamcast era of racing games. How can longtime fans of this series blindly ignore this? The vehicle sounds are not great given the available resources Polyphony Digital  has at it's disposal compare to even the arcadey Need for Speed games. The car visuals are not consistent. It is very visually clear which vehicle models are recycled from the last game and which ones are new. The same can be said for the tracks.  For a company that only makes one game, I would fire the entire team and hire a new team to make the next entry or shutter the studio and buy/form a new studio of people who actually give a damn. The new Forza game is lacking in car selection and track variety compared to this game but at least ALL the content is new and fresh and even more accurate. My advice to anybody considering this game: buy an Xbox 360 and the last Forza game to get your sim racing fix. That is the last example of a truly remarkable racing sim game."
1587,2,i Liked the first 2 weeks i had it but then a mouth later some of the keys stop working but the wierd thing is it still lighted up
1588,2,The other games were better in the series.
1589,2,"This game is more like Bad Company 2 than anything resembling a Battlefield game.

For me, the Battlefield series has been as much about strategy and troop movements as it was about being a shooter. Not so for Battlefield 3. They put so much crap on the screen, both digital and otherwise, that any sense of tactics is thrown out. The maps have so much smoke, debris and crap floating around that spotting enemy movements is difficult at best. Add to that all the blips that are friendlies and every checkpoint on the map and your screen becomes a mess of useless information.

Further, most maps are about the same size as those in Bad Company 2. I've only managed to get on fairly large-sized maps a few times and even then there were only a couple of tanks on either side. Were you expecting pitched tank battles like you'd find in Battlefield 1942 or 2142? You won't find it here.

The bottom line for me is that they went after the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty audience (realism) instead of catering to the audience they had already established (tactical)."
1590,2,"I've been playing Triple Play Baseball since the 1998 edition.  Each year as baseball season rolls around, I've been duped (yes, duped) into buying the latest edition of Triple Play baseball.
Never again.
Now, let me say this: if you're not a true, diehard fan of the national pastime, if you don't get goosebumps at the conclusion of the of the Star Spangled Banner, if the thought of a dog and a beer and the pastoral pleasures of a 2-1 pitchers' duel don't appeal to you, then this game may be for you.
In short, if you're looking for a baseball game with all the trimmings of an arcade game on steroids, then you will enjoy this game.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a true baseball sim, then you'll want to stay away from this game.
There are no injuries.  There are very few extra base hits.  The pitcher/batter interface is simply remedial.  (You know *exactly* where the ball is going to be pitched before it's thrown; all you have to do is make sure your cursor is lined up right and gauge the speed.)  You don't have to warm up the relief pitchers.  It's impossible to strike out the CPU.  (To the other extreme, on All Star Baseball, I had 14 K's with Greg Maddux, who is NOT a strikeout pitcher.)  There are no walks.
In addition, there is no franchise mode.  Will we EVER see a game that combines great graphics, actual baseball simulation, great gameplay AND a franchise mode?
On the positive side, the graphics are terrific, and the controls are better than those on All Star Baseball.
Simply put, all that's missing is the keg.  Afterall playing this game is no better than playing in an industrial league softball tournament.
If you're a casual baseball fan, this game's for you.  However, if you're a baseball purist, this game is not for you.  Unfortunately, there's not a single baseball game currently out for the PS2 that's worth the $50.
We have to wait until 2002..."
1591,2,"Even if I was a great fan of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diablo/dp/B0007YBJ1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diablo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D2/dp/B0002BQN7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D2</a>, I was late in deciding to take D3 on. It was a combination of factors, from the bad reviews the game kept getting, to the constant servers errors I kept hearing about and to me being too busy to take up such a time-eater. However, I came across it at a great discount and, on an impulse, decided to give it a try. Three weeks of (casual) gameplay later this is what I think.

DIABOLICALLY GORGEOUS
The game is beautiful to look at and a visual pleasure to play in. The environments are meticulously rendered and yet they loose none of their details when zoomed in or acted upon. Blowing up tree trunks or exploding bodies of enemies is both fun and physically accurate. Sure, some heads or pieces of wood can be seen to spin for too long, but that is part of the game's appeal, right? You are become Death, the destroyer of Worlds!

YOUR CHORD SOUNDS FAMILIAR
The sounds are better than the music but they are both quite well made. What I found strange was that, at least once, throughout Act I, the background music clearly reminded me of the main theme from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baldur-s-Gate/dp/B002TOKQH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baldur's Gate</a>. Let's chalk this one off as ...tribute.

GRINDING BUILDS CHARACTER.
The bad news is that it builds exactly the same kind of character for everyone. There are no choices when leveling up. Everything eventually gets unlocked for you and you only get to choose what 4 skills to use and which runes to combine with each one. Your strength, dexterity, intelligence and vitality get automatically increased, depending on your class. No more making a tank out of a ranger I am afraid. And this is where the game looses its first star.
The fact that you get to have a sidekick that does practically little more than keep the mobs occupied until you dispense of them, does not help either.

CULTURAL PHOBIAS DO NOT A GOOD STORY MAKE
Yes, the story plot is infantile, disrespectful to the original games (I will refrain from spoiling it) and it offers very little help in immersing into the game world. It is unfortunate because, BLIZZARD has proved in the past that they can produce games with a very good back-story, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starcraft-II/dp/B000RE216U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starcraft II</a>.
However, this a game franchise that is heavily invested on the Judeo-Christian culture of the Devil. Just read the name on the box! So, taking away demonic pentagrams and most religious symbols (some crosses can still be found) fools no one. Because once you go down that road and then decide to backup, you should make sure not to step on yourself and trip. As in: if a golden-eyed Fallen Angel (Hello!) is helping you fight Diablo, are you sure who is the Devil and who is not?

LOOT. LOOT NEVER CHANGES.
Well designed and clearly labeled items make all the difference in the world. I would love for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borderlands-2/dp/B0085R05LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borderlands 2</a>&nbsp;items to have such a clear Damager-Per-Second (DPS) number to make comparisons easier. Pair this with an inventory that is big enough and free of the need to play item-Tetris in (all items take up either one or two vertical squares) and you have yourself almost loot haven. Almost because you still get too many unusable items, mostly because of class restrictions.
You can stash such items in your common stash to share with your other heroes (on the same BattleNet account) but make sure to find the necessary...700,000 gold to pay for all the extra stash space. Hint: use the Auction House while you still can.
The only thing I found missing is the ability to add sockets to magical items and enchant regular ones.

THE AUCTION HOUSE: BRILLIANT! (WHEN IT WORKS)
I am going to go against the current here but here it is: I found the Auction House a brilliant idea. Well designed and decently executed. I am going to be sad to see it go on March, as announced. I can only hope they change their mind before then.
In all honesty, I am currently a Demon Hunter at Nightmare difficulty. And I have heard the complaints that it is impossible to finish Inferno without Real-Money Auction House (which is clearly not how it is supposed to work) but up to Nightmare, using the Auction House is the only way to get enough money to be able to do the enhancements you want, craft or buy the items you covet and unlock the precious extra stash space you need.

CHAINS IN NEED OF BREAKING
I withheld the second star because of the always-online requirement. Because it is indeed a hassle and a hindrance (just try pausing in town for longer than half and hour and see what happens). Yes, the game does offer some gameplay features (namely, the Auction-House) to compensate for the inconvenience but they all give way to anger and frustration whenever BlLIZZARD's servers go down  and you are unable to play a Single-player game for days at a time(!). Take away the Auction-House, however, and the always-online requirement becomes a severe and now unjustified hindrance!

THE ORIGINAL SIN
No, D3 looses its third and final star for being both short and boring at times. There, I said it. Yes, it is a well balanced eye-candie, with tons of loot, problematic character development yet the gameplay feels like at chore at times and it is over before you know it. I even found Act I (the one offered for free as a demo) to be better designed and longer than the rest.

It is like that old Woody Allen joke: two old ladies are complaining about their retirement home catering. ""The food was awful, barely edible"", ""I know"", her friend replied, ""and such small portions!""."
1592,2,"Update: After using it for about a week, I have developed very bad headache. Either my head is too big or the headset is just too small. I try to set the headset to the largest setting and is still too small for me. I guess people may like it if they have a normal size head.

Original: I was expecting some awesome sound but it is nowhere close to it. My expectation was sure unrealistic. Perhaps the speakers and the sound card I have are pretty good already. Anyway, I was able to hear sounds I didn't notice before in game and it was awesome. The bass is a bit lacking but I guess bass can be distracting in games. My head is no way too big and this headset barely fit it. I wish it is a bit bigger. It is not as comfortable as I thought and a bit heavier than I like.
For the price (less than $100), the quality is pretty good. I think I can get another pair for my spouse."
1593,2,"These are ok for light use but I am not a light use player. I bought these for my Cinch controller and after about a week of use I noticed they started to tear from rubbing on the controller. The analog sticks have enough movement, and these stick out far enough, that they will actually rub against the face of the controller. I ended up removing them and am still looking for something better.

Shipping was great! On time fast delivery. The product is not so good."
1594,2,"This game was kind of boring throughout the story. It was never exciting or drew me into the game, more of a start and finish type game."
1595,2,Buy a sony product at your own cation.  I have gone through two controllers within a one yuear time span.  These controllers die out very easily.
1596,2,"I really should have listened to the negative reviewers. This game sucked. The story was way past kewl and I kept wanting to know what happened next and stuff. However, I didn't want to actually play the game to get there. I wasn't having any fun. The gameplay was just atrocious. I was forced to control characters I didn't like and watch as the computer (poorly) controlled the ones I did like. In fact my control was laudable. There was an ""autofight"" button that I had to rely on in order to maximize my battle score. Yes each battle is scored, meaning that the less time it takes to win, the better your rewards may be. Thus using the autofight button is almost required. It just took all the fun out of it. BTW, forget how much I disliked the gameplay, how is this a greatest hits in 2011 when it was released in spring of 2010? Why isn't prototype a greatest hit or mass effect 1? Well that was a waste of $20. I guess I'll just head back to ME2 and DA2."
1597,2,"Our 8 year old son played it for about 30 min. and asked me to come turn it off.  Very repetitive, just a lot of walking around collecting bones from what I saw...but for ten bucks (got it on sale), it's okay.  The characters don't really look like the one's in the real cartoon but the voices sound like the cartoon/movie.  Maybe we will like it more after playing it again..."
1598,2,"With an interesrsting storyline that will give you a chance to play as predator and restore your honor, 100 years in the future, the game is rather original for a predator on screen creation, but not without its so many flaws.

First, this game is NOT a free roaming game. And if it is, then forget grand theft auto, or Spiderman 2's deffinition of ""free roaming"" and think more like a small level that WILL actually let you go anywhere you can jump, or crawl to. Other than that, you can't go just ANYWHERE... And not only that, to make matters worse, you can't just kill anyone. Now let's think predator, that's pretty close to the real thing. But as far as sneakiness and staulking your pray is concerned, you just have to stay invisible, you don't have to watch your prey for very long before you can lock and flay, dismember, grab, punture, slam, burn, knock out, or even just completly destroy your victim into a heap of trembling flesh. With that said, this is a very violent game, more so than grandtheft auto in some respects.

I'll hand it to the creater's that they held true to predator style looking cut scenes, and did a great job at the first person vision viewers. But I take one star away just simply because, the graphics are beautiful... for a 1998 game! the graphics are horrible! Predator looks beautifully like predator, everything else looks like... an early playstation 1 game's graphics. The graphics are... horrible for a 2005 playstation2 game. The cut scenes are wonderful, but you have to get unshocked to really see it, since you notice your victims barly look like people sometimes.

The sounds aren't too much to hear either. There's more quiet than any actual car noise, or just city noise. And the score is on a ten second playback, it's almost like they pooled al their rescources into just making the story and left the quality of game play in the dust. The controls are easily mastered and most levels that don't involve you killing your prey are pretty challenging. And for the most part, the last 10 levels [of this 30 something level game], are very challenging indeed... on hard.

I'll hand it to the game, it is fun to play, once you realize there are new weapons, costumes and a host of other goodies hidden... mind you, HIDDEN, within each level, one finds himself going back just to find the goodies. The storyline is really good and played out, enough so that the mini clips could probably amount to a ten minute mini-movie; but don't worry, you get plenty of game play.
I'll take another star off for not letting predator swim... or for that matter, for just falling through the water as if it were an abyss [they do this for half of the barriers in this game], and with the exception of one level [the warf], you don't really have to apply yourself in the art of staulking [and in the movies, that's 2/3s of what predator does!], once you engage the enemy, he usually knows where you're at no matter what. Bosses can see through your cloak, which makes it more challenging, but takes away the feeling of predator... Since even Good old Arnold had trouble seeing him in the movie.

With all of that said, who needs combos? ... I do.
I like to keep games interesting with mixed attacks and creative killing capabilities... you can see all the combos and killing methods within 29 seconds flat. Then you have to resort to using tools [plasma mines, spears, shoulder mounted plasma gun, and so on]. But I will thank them for giving us three weapon choices [telescope stick, and the maul to name two]. But other than that killing your prey is very, very, very, very... repedative and mundane. So much so, ill take another star off for the sheer repedativness of attacks and kills. Once you've seen all the attacks twice... You rarly go looking for enemies to kill, and just try to finish the level. That's how boring the moves are.

Laslty, there is a level where you get to go up against your arche nemesis, ALIEN! And I wasn't thoroughly disapointed in that, in fact that was one of the more interesting levels, though if only it was a little bigger with more to do.

In the end if you just want a game you'll be entertained with for a few days, this is a good rent [39.99 is a bit too much to ask in the long run]. it will save you the embarassment of buying it and totally wishing you hadnt.
Don't get me wrong, I give it two stars just because it was so much fun to play. For it's funness alone I give it two stars, and with such a great story to follow, it really was that much more fun. But I am very disapointed in that it's not free roaming, the graphics are horrible, and once you've gotten all the little goodies hiding in all the levels [and you must finish the game to do so], there is ABSOLUTLY no reason... ABSOLUTLY NO REASON,
to play the game again [even on a more difficulty level it just isn't worth it].

This game is ruined by repedativeness, and riddled with unrelentingly bad graphics that made me laugh at the opening words [2005 trade mark] the second time i turned the game on. Very fun the first time around [first few levels], 0 replay value [unless you wait for 4 months to play it again, like i did[Midway through the game] Then at least you make it a little fun].

On a fun scale, this game is a 4, because you actually get t play as predator and he looks way better than spidy did in spiderman2 [the game]. You get to kill as him, and for the first 30 seconds of being him/it/she [whatever it is] i add two stars for that alone. Throughout the game [the begining] when things are simple and fairly realistic [and your enemies CANNOT see through the cloak] this game is very very very fun [hence two more stars]... when you get creative and come in at different angles, use your secondary weapons, grab your victims and make a sport of throwing them off rooftops [or kicking], and of course... just ripping them apart in a methodical rage. This game is so much fun in the first five minutes... But it's worth four stars for just those five minutes. The rest is... one star minus five.

Don't buy this game, rent it, you won't be as disapointed."
1599,2,"I have to admit, when I started the game, it looked really awesome. I kept playing it. I got to the third level and just realized it was not a good game. It is hard and the music is horrible. I would recommend Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 over this any day. I don't think you should get this game. Save your money. The levels are dumb, the graphics are ok, the music and sound is horrible, and the story line is lame. It is just like any other sports game, where you have objectives. The objectives are really dumb. The board doesn't go as high as you would think. It is like a few inches from the ground. I thought I would be able to fly with the character. Doesn't turn out that way. The mobility is not too good. The game seems a bit old, too. I just don't want anyone to be dissappointed the way I am."
1600,2,I don't like this game
1601,2,"The grips get in the way
Not really useful"
1602,2,"I had the oppurtunity to have my way with the Sims 2 with PS2 somewhat recently... it was an experience i would like to remember as good, but i cant, because it wasnt, it was a very lame experience. There are SOME highlights to the games (such as a new innovative way to control your sims using the controller and better graphics) but I had a very negative experience playing this..

- When in 2 player mode, if someone decided to, i don't know, talk to me while im in the middle of something my person would drop everything without my consent and talk to them... whats worse is i had NO control how long i would be in talking modes and the other person COMPLETELY controlled everything that happened, this was unfortunate because i would like to have been involved.

- Beginning the game you start out with 2 people, and if you don't like that, you have to generate someone until they look CLOSE to the way you want your sim to look. I am a very picky sims-maker, and the customization in this game was WORSE than previous ps2 titled. (for example: bustin' out was LEAPS ahead of this one in its SIM creation beginning) I literally sat there for 10 minutes regenerating my sims till they looked ""ok""... and the customization options were very slim pickings.

I was very excited to play this game, am a huge SIMS fan, have all of them nearly, but this was certainly a let down and i feel EA should repay me... for 1: the game, and 2: my time...

I DO NOT suggest this game, and I feel EA should recall them and REDO this game because it is such bull compared to all the others for pc and gaming consoles."
1603,2,Sucks. Hadn't had it more than a few weeks when buttons stopped working.
1604,2,"Bought this to play with my 6 year old son, result was play control is not the best and as reviewed by a kid = boring.  Single player mode is better but that is not the way we are playing it.  6 & 7 year old playing together also came to the same conclusion and the game is now collecting dust after only a day or two.  Thus a dud from a two player perspective."
1605,2,it fake
1606,2,"Rememember when arcade hoops games were so much fun, just pickup and play? I Remember playing NBA Hangtime in college with my friends, we did 2 on 2 action and it was the best of what Midway did, arcade sports! As of late, Midway has kind of turned me away from their titles. And with E.A.'s serious hooper called NBA Street, Ballers seems to fall short in the fun factor category.  NBA Ballers on the XBOX was Midway's first return back to arcade hoops since NBA Showtime, and while I did like Ballers quite a bat, the Chosen one gets away from the fundamentals of the game, and it's just simply not that fun to play. The first issue is the graphics. This simply is not a next gen looking game. The courts look sweet enough, but the players look fake, and their faces and skin looks too fakey fakey to be taken literally. Motion caputred moves get the job done, but once again, things are way over done and nothing looks amazing to knock your socks off. NBA Street Vol 3 looks better and that game was out quite a some time ago. The main issue with the game is that you don't have to check the ball out after a rebound. So basically the game consists of you ""if you wanted"" standing under the basket for a rebound then instantly going up for the dunk with no reason to take the ball back or play defense. This problem takes away zero strategy on both offense and defense. Checking the ball is a standard for all street hoops game, especially for 2 on 2 or 1 on 1 battles at 1/2 court. The gameplay is fair, but pulling out special moves seems to complictated for it's own good and the 360 controller is not implimented as well as it could have been. But even when you leave out the special moves and stick with jumping, blocking, and dribbling, the game still feels lathargic and the lack of any real strategy thanks to not having to checking the ball out, ruins the game.  I had the most fun going online and playing with people, you can 1 on 1 and 2 on 2 battles against people onilne ,but once again, the gameplay still is ruined. If you can request people to check the ball out after each rebound, makes the game to be more enticing.

I love arcade hoops titles, the classics like NBA Hangtime, Jam and Showtime will always be missed. It's too bad the step to next gen has been a step back  for fun, at least with Midway's hoops titles. The Chosen one can't even get the basics down right and ruins the game. Might be worth a rent or two with some friends, but other than that, you might as well keep playing NBA Street Vol 3 or wait for Street 4...

Graphics: Players faces look like their real counterparts and the facial expressions are nice, but the bodies look fake and their bodies are way over done. What is that, paint gloss over their bodies?

Gameplay: Performing special moves are tricky, and just not fun to pull off or watch as you do them. With the new midway rule of not having to check the ball out, you can stand there and wait for a miss, then go up for the next shot. Um, no Midway, this ruins the game.

Sound: Good music, good sound effects,  not much chattering.

Fun Factor: A few games online might be fun for a bit, but once again, the lack of having to check the ball out after a miss, takes any fun that there was available, out of the game completely.

Overall: Stick with NBA Street Vol 3, you can pick that game up for under 20 bucks now and it's still the better game of hoops. Better luck next time Midway. Bring back NBA Hangtime and I'll be happy."
1607,2,"Nothing could have prepared me or any other true Mega Man X fan for how much they messed this game up.  Apparently there was a staff shake-up before it came out, something that would not surprise me one bit.  It seems that these new people wrote up a list entitled ""Ways to make the players hate us.""  Here's why.

1) Why did they mess up the armor system?  I was surprised and disillusioned to see you start off with the X4 armor.  Wasn't a lot of the fun in the first 4 games starting off with nothing and finding stuff as you went along?  It also does not help that they RUINED the plasma gun from X4 and no longer let you shoot through walls.  Sure there are capsules in X5, but now it's eight instead of four for two sets of armor.  That may sound cool, but acquiring them is more annoying than fun.  You can't even use an upgrade when you get the capsule.  You have to wait until you get all four pieces to the SAME armor before you can use ANY part you get.  Of course it doesn't help either that both the armors suck.  Neither of them looks appropriate for a general armor that would come to mind if you think ""Mega Man X5.""  When you think about the first game, you can think of the completed armor he had in it.  In X5, both the armors look too specialized, and that's exactly what they are.  The Gaea Armor has kind of a cool gun that of course breaks certain blocks, but it is no fun to use because you can only move very slowly in it, and you can't even mid-air dash or use weapons in it.  The Falcon Armor lets you fly for a period of roughly five to ten seconds, but when I first saw the powered-up gun for the Falcon Armor, I wasn't sure if I was kidding myself or not by what I saw.  It is the worst gun X has ever had.  Mega Man's Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 back on NES would blow it off the face of the planet, even the universe.  How they could make a gun this pathetic is beyond me.  Simply put, one armor's all gun and no movement, and the other's all movement and no gun.  Where's the balance here?  A good armor would have at least SOME balance.

2) For those who haven't played X5, you will be stopped frozen at least five times a stage forced to read annoying text messages transmitted to you from some stupid new ally named Alia who you'll just want to kill more than anything else.  Think of Navi or the owl from Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time except 100 times worse.  No, there's no way to skip or shut off Alia unless you're revisiting the stage and already listened to it (with the same character).  If the text messages were interesting and useful, it may have been pardonable, but no.  Instead we're babysat with lectures like ""Don't jump on the spikes.  You'll die!""  ""Get off the train!  It's exploding!""  I don't ever recall playing a Mega Man or X game to be babysat.  The new staff must have thought that all of us Mega Man veterans out there never progressed beyond 5 years of age.  They obviously never did, so it's quite possible.  Alia is shown with her with her mouth wide open wearing some sort of earphone device in the mission report screen in between stages (a part that has the some of the worst Mega Man or Mega Man X music ever created).  I'd love so much to stick a piece of dynamite in her wide open mouth and never have to listen to her again.  I'd love to do even worse to the morons who made this game.  Where did Alia, Signas, Douglas, and all these other dorks come from anyway?  Even at X8 it's a mystery.

3) There is absolutely NO creativity or set of new ideas in this game.  This is quite obvious considering that they brought back the Rock Monster for the boss of the first Sigma stage, the eye boss from the first game for the second Sigma stage, a time stopper weapon, the Quick Man laser beams, the Mega Man X capsule music for capsules, Bubble Crab's music for Duff McWhalen's stage, and much more.  Yes, you read correctly.  There is a boss called Duff McWhalen.  This brings the review to the bosses.  It's hard to contemplate how much they must have thought about different ways to make the bosses suck.  Just look at their names.  Izzy Glow?  The above mentioned Duff McWhalen?  Dark Dizzy?  The Skiver?  Axle the Red?  Are these supposed to be cool boss names?  The bosses in battle are not exactly inspiring either.  Most of them are just so ridiculously slow.  How long does the fat bear boss float through the air with his arms shaped as if he wanted to give you a hug?  I've lost count...  How long does the bat boss just slowly fly around the room and shoot NOTHING at you?  It can vary, but either way it's awfully long.  And did they even know that the firefly boss IZZY GLOW looks like he's defecating when he does his laser attacks?  Did they know that the fight with the horse boss of the sky stage is on an airplane much like Storm Eagle's from X1?  Did they know this boss even does some of the EXACT SAME attacks as Storm Eagle?  If I wanted to, I could find something bad to say about EVERY stage, boss, and weapon (of which X's none are cool or original) in the game, but I'll let players deduce that for themselves.  The only good thing I can say about the bosses is that I wish the squid boss were in another game because he's the only one close to cool (but not the weapon he gives X).
I have never heard worse boss music before X5.  You can disagree with me if you want, but I really thought the boss music in X4 was exceptional, at least for Mega Man X boss music.  It was energetic and put you in a fighting mode.  X5's goes to sounding like some AWFUL messed up version of some dumb pop song.  I really wonder if they tested this game at all.  They obviously didn't test their own intelligence or capability.

4) X5 is simply almost no fun to play.  X is just horrible.  His attacks and weapons suck, and he does practically NO DAMAGE to bosses, even with the right weapon.  You'll be fighting bosses for ten minutes in the later stages with X unless you use the restrictive Gaea Armor or pick up the Ultimate Armor.  Having X and Zero available the whole game instead of choosing to play the whole game as one or the other may seem like a good idea at first, but it ended up being more frustrating than beneficial.  You have to figure out how to divide up the heart tanks, and Zero can't even get some of them.  You also have to revisit nearly every stage if you want to get everything, taking away from the players any motivation to form their own strategy, order, or way of playing in general.  There were absolutely NO new ideas or stage creativity or at ANY point in the game.  Some of the stages could just be cruised through with the Falcon Armor in under a minute.  Stage brevity has always, in my view, been a problem of these games, but X5 is the only instance in which I would not complain.  Wonder why...
The whole time limit thing was also retarded.  All it did was prompt more annoying speech from Alia such as ""You don't need to be here"" if you picked a stage that didn't have a part for whatever you needed at the time.

There are not a whole lot of good things about this game at all.  Zero's crescent saber from the bear boss is cool, but that's about it.  This game is a miserable excuse for an addition to the Mega Man X series.  I wish I could have flown over to Japan and fired every single Capcom staff member who had anything to do with this game.  X5 is not a good game on any terms.  People who write reviews saying it's good or ""Just another Mega Man game,"" do NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  My guess is that the makers probably thought about ""innovation,"" a word I have grown to hate.  ""Innovation"" in the modern sense of the word, does not have a place in the formula with the Mega Man X games.  The ""innovation"" in these games should come in the stage design and background, boss ideas, and weapon ideas.  It should NOT include messing up a whole foundation.  They put all this garbage in X5 and expect players to be happy because of a new ability to duck??  Sorry, I'll take no ducking any day.  As the result of this failed attempt at ""innovation,"" X5 was the beginning of a period of disappointment that would last for the next few games.  I'll admit that I own the game being a fan (though by now possibly a former fan...), but even now I still want some form of brutal vengeance against Capcom for this bitter disappointment."
1608,2,"I love stealth games. If a game lets me take a stealthy approach I'll take it. I really like Dishonored. A lot. It's one of my favorite games. I never got in on the original Thief series since I wasn't a PC gamer when those games were rolling out. I picked this game up when it was on sale hoping that the professional reviews were exaggerated in their criticisms. They aren't. This game is poorly designed, the controls are frustrating, the voice acting and writing is bad and the graphics are incredibly underwhelming for being a ""next-gen"" game.

The actual gameplay shows potential but nearly everything about it is wrong. The levels lack much verticality and despite the levels being ""open"" it really feels like there are only one or two valid approaches to finishing them sneakily. I couldn't bring myself to finish the game because the frustrating controls and poor level design just frustrated me too much to actually enjoy this game."
1609,2,"Absolutely not. There is almost nothing to like about this title other than its colorful, almost Ratchet and Clank-like visuals."
1610,2,"The game looks like an incredible game and everything is great in it excepet for one big detail: The song list sucks hard, it has only like 5 good songs the rest are sh@#@t!! A better selection of songs would have made of this game the best guitar hero!"
1611,2,"Lufia 2 rise the sinistral is the epitome of the mediocrity, no matter what's the legion of fanboy snes rpg tell you. It's avarage.
The puzzle-oriented dungeon design is the strong point of the game.

The positive

- always escape
- no casual encounters ( only world map)
- dungeons are fun!
- good extra

The negative

- terrible storyline, simple and cliched plot, really a disappointment
- stereotyped characters
- the game don't aged very well
- the gameplay is a bit monotonous
- ugly and repetitive graphics (it's a 1996 game and secret of mana, release in 1993 has much better graphics!!)
- mediocre soundtrack
- poor presentation
- easy near the end

graphics 5/10

replay value : avarage, good amount of extra"
1612,2,"I love the game when I get to the snowboarding parts, but its way too much work getting to ride. The graphics are really sweet. I love the way snow gets kicked up into the camera when you land, but I don't know if I can get over the glaringly annoying features of this game:
 1) I feel like I am playing one of those Barbie dress-up games when I get to buy coats, pants, and goggles, give me a break. New equipment such as boards and bindings make sense, but jackets?!?!
2) Too much menu wrangling to get to the actual game play. If I lose a competition, there is no retry button. You have to go back to the lodge and walk over to the cheesy box head guy and enter all over again. Then at the end of the run you have to choose between replay and proceed, with the default always being proceed. Its just a major hassle. They should learn from Tony Hawk. They have it down.
3) Too much loading, especially in multiplayer session stuff. Nobody likes spending more time loading than playing.
4) Not enough thought put into the session competitions. For instance, there is one race with rails and windy, narrow lanes that have huge drop-offs on either side, if you fall off either side, you lose. It ends rather abrubtly this way, right before either player can get into it. Why not just send the rider back to the beginning of the course?"
1613,2,"I bought a pair of these for my XB1 controller. It worked okay, but wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. So I decided to do some research to see if I could find a better option. After a little looking, I found a betteI bought one of these for my XB1 controller. It worked okay, but wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. So I decided to do some research to see if I could find a better option. After a little looking, I found a better (imo) grip called Striker Grips, it is less expensive and gives a much better feel and keeps your hands from sweating better."
1614,2,"I bought ""Keepsake"" a couple months ago, and paid less than $6 for it, because it's an older game. It's clearly stated on the game that it is OK with an XP.

However, there are two places in the game where when I clicked on a place, my computer suddenly rebooted. And the reboot would stall. I had to unplug the computer and start it up again to get function.  This happened in two places twice:  clicking on the dumb waiter in the pantry, and moving a knob on the dragon light puzzle in the garden.  I went to the official website and found only one patch, for ""voices"". Didn't seem like that was my problem, but I downloaded it anyway.

I started a second game and printed out two walk-throughs, one by Wicked Designs, who created the game. I did this to make sure that I hadn't missed any triggers.  Sometimes when you do something out of order, a game has hiccups.  The same problems occured in the second game. I got as far in the game as I could without using these two steps. And then the same thing happened.  In both places, the computer would rebooot and there didn't seem to be anything I could do about it.

I have had trouble with other older Dreamcatcher games, where the box SAYS it works on an XP, but then it doesn't without glitches.

I'm bummed, because I enjoyed the game as far as I got (according to the walkthroughs, less than half done). I gave it four stars for FUN and two stars overall. I love the game graphics - totally cool castle - and the gameplay and puzzles weren't too easy or too hard. The voice acting is not that good and some of the dialouge was pretty cheesy. But overall it was fun to play.

Happy Reader"
1615,2,"not sure if it was this one or the other one, order for my son, only had one disc was suppoed to have 2, he rented from the library and it had 2"

I have tried to charge them via usb connected to the xbox one, generic wall charger, and laptop to no avail. No matter how long I hold the power button down they will not turn on (and the red light showing that they were charging was on, it is no longer on as they are supposed to be fully charged.  Any help or advice would be appreciated (waiting to hear back from TB support).

So while they worked

Setup
I had these up and running in about 10 minutes. The transmitter connects via usb AND optical cable. I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ViewHD-SPDIF-TOSLINK-Digital-Optical-Audio-Switcher-3x1-with-Remote-Three-Inputs-to-One-Output/dp/B00G188Z7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ViewHD SPDIF | TOSLINK Digital Optical Audio Switcher 3x1 with Remote (Three Inputs to One Output)</a>&nbsp;so that I could have my soundbar and headset transmitter connected at the same time. Works great. There is only one audio optical out on the xbox one so you will  need something like this if you have multiple audio devices with optical usage.
The headset paired very easily and sound was working very quickly.
I updated the firmware later on and it took another 15 minutes as you have to download a TB program and then update them.

Wireless?
Absolutely wireless-yes! No connection to controller or console needed.

Comfortable?
I have worn these for about 3-4 hours straight without any discomfort. They are comfortable by my standards.

Sound
I am not an audiophile but I have owned other TB's in the past, and these have the best sound quality I have experienced in headset. Gunshots and explosions in COD AW sound great. I have never owned any other brand so I can't really compare to astros ect.
Now as others have said these don't get CRAZY loud. I probably have them at 75% loudness and it is very crisp and a good volume for me. If I put them all the way up it is too loud for me but honestly I expected them to get louder. I'll put it this way, it is too loud for me but it doesn't hurt my ears.
The presets work well as you can definitely tell the difference when surround is on and when it is not. There is gaming mode (with four different settings like shooter, sports, racing), movie mode (with horror, action, drama), and music (with dance, acoustic, stadium), and SS off.

Charge
I probably played 10-15 hours for the first drain. FYI they beeped twice letting me know that the battery was drained. THere is no capability to use batteries or a charging pack (which would have been nice).

Mic
So I wasn't exactly thrilled with the mic either. It has three settings for sensitivity on the headset. I found myself having to talk pretty loudly for it to pick up my voice even on the most sensitive setting and it didn't work on the least sensitive. It is nice that the mic pics up your voice and then you can hear it through the headset.
The mic does plug in or out so you don't have to walk around with a mic if you don't want too.

Noise cancellation
So I could hear outside noise with these on which is fine by me. I am sure if you had it on the loudest setting though, you would not hear much outside noise.

Different uses
You can use these for PC (mic doesnt work). I have not tried other uses yet but it does have headphone output as well.

So if these had continue to work I would give them 4.5 stars. Sound is very good, could be louder. Mic is a little finicky."
1617,2,"This game really sucks!! The campaign is really short about 4 or 5 hours, though some of the gameplay is fun but a lot of it is frustrating and stupid. Multiplayer is the same.
 The reason for two stars is i have played much worse but my advice is to save the money and get a much better game that is easy and fun to play."
1618,2,"What is the point of playing a game if it doesn't have an ending???  I don't know...

Either way, this is more of an interactive movie than a game.  All you do is play audio clips that trigger memory flashbacks.  There really aren't any puzzles, just a few movements to make when you play someone during a flashback.  If you don't want much to do then this game is an enjoyable one, because it has a great feel to it.  The environment is really interesting.

But then again, It didn't explain really anything in the end.  Maybe they are making a sequel???"
1619,2,"I seem to be alone in my review but this is it. I was expecting an open world action game what i got was a puzzle game without instructions or any clear goal? You start the game with no idea what you can do, what you supposed to do or how to even do it? I was expecting more of an action/rpg type game where you can level/power up your favorite heroes  but this is clearly a puzzle game. You run around constantly being attacked by ever spawning enemies trying to figure out just what it is you are supposed to do? Makes it tedious when you are searching for a button icon but whenever enemies are surrounding you its giving you those anyway. So far it is not open world and the camera angles cannot be changed to look around? Not sure if it changes later but so far everyone including Hulk is stuck at 4 hearts and your dead. Seems to be unlimited continues but gets irritating. On the fair side it has excellent graphics(too bad they didn't make them more realistic or even cartoon looking and not lego). I liked the voice overs from the films. I am only a few levels in on Caps flashback perhaps it will change as i go. I guess if you into this style of game and have played lego games before, it just wasn't what i expected. Wish they would make a Marvels Ultimate Alliance 3 for the PS4 =*("
1620,2,"I never thought I'd be saying this but,I'm done.
I've been building my own gaming machines for years and it's been a blast.
I've upgraded video cards,downloaded updated drivers and dealt with all the other fun stuff that goes with PC Gaming but,the last two games have done me in.....for good. What two games could turn off an avid Gamer? Brothers In Arms Hell's Highway and Far Cry 2. Nothing was wrong with either game,when they ran,it's the when they ran BS that clinched it for me. Brothers put me through the BSOD (ati3daug.dll) until I backed down to the original drivers that came with my ATI 3870. Far Cry 2 is now crashing to desktop,no error message at all.
I been on a few forums and everyone seems to think that it has something to do with the security that's on the disk,if this is the case,it will be the nail in the cofen. I won't give up gaming,I'll just start using my PS3 for more than a DVD player. Oh,you want a game review when it runs it's fun. It looks good, sounds good but if I had to do it all over again I'd pay the extra 10 bucks and buy the PS3 version."
1621,2,"I really really tried to like this game. But I can't live in denial. This game is a mess.  I waited for the patches promised and upheavel in graphics and gameplay. That time has come and it's still just a terrible reboot to this classic franchise. I sadly, but honestly can say, that NBA Live 10 is light years better than this, and even 09 and 08 are more fun. It's probably as good in terms of fun factor than NBA Live 06 was which was a buggy mess too. The main problem is the game speed. It's robotic, slow and sloppy. Major clipping issues, zero fluidity and graphics are tremendously underwhelming. Both the Ps4 and XBOX1 versions could easily pass for a current gen game. In many ways, it looks worse than the 3-5 year old NBA Live games. It's got potential and the game can be somewhat fun at times, but again, it's just so lethargic. It's definitely not up to par with Madden and FIFA which actually are nice launch games for the systems. Other issues you'll notice is between the lines. There are no game sliders, no roster editing options, not very many modes, no FIBA, no team editing, no player creator, okay, you get it. It's lacking.

NBA Live is back, but fans of this beloved franchise will want to skip this. I'm semi hopeful maybe NBA Live 15 (if they release it) might be competent. But if you need your Live fix, go back to the old games and save your money."
1622,2,Audio is great but other equipment such as phones and radios can't be near them at all or it'll make a crackling sound because interference..
1623,2,"Very disappointing. Heavy Rain is one of my favored gaming experiences. Beyond was not immersive. I never felt that anything mattered; nothing was at stake. Feels more like an interactive story. I found the story to be slow and boring. The characters are not developed well. The chronology is chopped up, a la Tarrentino, and put the main character at arms length. Difficult to get to know her. No interest in replaying it. The graphics are stunning for last gen."
1624,2,"I play Black Op games to play multiplayer and communicate but this game has really bad mic issues. And it wasn't just me, my friends have issues with it too. You have to be in a party to communicate."
1625,2,These headphones came free in my PS4 bundle. They are great for people with small heads... unlike me. The sound quality is great even when plugged into the controller but it's way too tight! I feel like my head is being cracked open by a nutcracker  when I wear these. They make my ears and temple sore and I would only recommend them for small children. I tried stretching them out a little but from what I've heard these are prone to snap easily...
1626,2,"I had high hopes for the Moga Pro but in the end too few games support the controller.  If you're into retro games then it might be nice for playing them on the go, but I find emulator based games to be easier to configure on the PC.

Even some of the games that I had read previously that were supposed to support the Moga, like Modern Combat 5, do not.  Big let down there.

Sometimes my moga couldn't see my Samsung Note 4, even after running the pivot app.  A reboot was the only fix.  For the price I expected a less error prone pairing process."
1627,2,The graphics doesn't look much better than last gen black ops2. The gameplay sucks. This game is second worse cod next to ghost! !!
1628,2,"I will start by saying this:  If you buy this game at the price it is right now (around $12-15 as of March 31st 2012) you're not getting too bad of a deal.  I wish I had bought it cheap, but I paid a lot more.  This came up on a clearance sale which is why I am now writing a review on it.

This game was a big let-down for me, but then again I also enjoy a good storyline and a combat system that at least takes some effort.  This was NOT it.  The graphics were way too cartoony for me, a lot like the cut-scenes in Mirror's Edge, if you've played that.  Yes, everyone has mentioned that the main character is hot, and she is, if you're into cartoon chicks.  Why is that what everyone mentions about the game?  Because there's not much more it has going for it.

The bottom line is, you won't get that great of a playing experience, so if you think it'll be anything like Tomb Raider, God of War, Fable, etc. etc., forget it.  The story line is really bad, the characters and voice acting is cheesy, and the combat system is way too simple and limited.  And, as was mentioned in at least one of the other reviews, you actually start over and play through the exact same levels again with different (or just more) creatures.  If there's anything that shows how very little effort was put into the game, that's a clear sign.

I liked the basic idea, but it just need so much more to make it more than a $10 game or a $2 rental."
1629,2,"If you've played games like Socom 1 and 2, and loved them, this game is not for you. If your looking for a first person shooter where you can just run into action and blow somebodys head off, this games not for you. If your looking for a slower-paced tactical, millitary game, this is for you. I'm one of the people that love the Socom-like games. Therefor 50$ was a huge dissapointment. Rent this game before you buy it. The game to me was not fun at all, but there was great graphics. To me Graphics do not make a game, they may help it, but I'm totally into gameplay, and I cant play this game longer then an hour without falling asleep."
1630,2,"The Positives:
Solid lengthed campaign.
Animated moral choice cutscenes look good.
Less co-op actions make the gameplay more fluid.
Gameplay overall is far more smooth then it was in the previous game.

The Negatives:
Graphics are not that impressive.
Moral choices are pointless.
Weapon Customization is really dumbed down, Almost pointless considering you can beat the entire game with the starter weapons and no upgrades.
Pointless collectibles that force you to play the game more then you should have to.
Plot is incredibly stupid and almost non-existant.
Pointless online multiplayer considering the fact that no one plays it.

Overall, A dumbed down weapon customization and weak plot really hurt the game's overall value. Especially when customizing your weapons was the best part of the first Army of Two game. Really disappointing game that I would not recommend."
1631,2,"Its too bad.  I was actually pretty excited about this game initially.  Why not?  It has a pretty intriguing story, admirable spooky, misty graphics, and a variety of cool playable characters.  So why is this game such a dissapointment?
There is no stategy or gamemanship required, whatsoever!  To make it through the entire game (which I did) requires nothing more than constant movement of your character and a quick (and strong) trigger finger.  This is more of an arcade-style game of the ""Space Invaders"" genre.  Hordes of bad dudes constantly chase your character and you shoot them until your finger falls off.  Its fun for the first hour or two and thats it."
1632,2,"The PSP 1001-K feels really bulky and clunky in your hands especially after using the slim model of the PS Vita. But its still a good buy if you can find it under 80 dollars because unlike the Vita it has a huge library which will satisfy players of any genre. I know some may be thinking that isn't the PSP & PS One libraries playable on the Vita, but only those that was released digitally meaning some great games like Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VIII which is only physical. It can also play imported games too. Its only drawback is that you can't use  a PS3 to put games on it, as Sony discontinued online functions for it and you can't update its software to last update.. In some regards to the original size and variety of its  library it's better than the Vita, but I would definitely take a look through the PS Store first to see what there's and what isn't."
1633,2,"I really wanted this game for a long time (since enjoying the minigame in the Nintendo Land game), then finally got a chance to try the free demo of the full version, and was very disappointed in the (very different) game play.  Even my 10 year old daughter who loved the mini game said ""no, don't buy it"".  I got super excited when I saw I could get this for super cheap with the amazon prime new release discount, then rememberd ""oh yeah, neither of us wants to play this"".  Oh well."
1634,2,"I got this new controller and it did look a little different with the silver like guide button and when I plug my chat pad in it doesn't work.

It still works on my other 3 controllers.

Defective? Junk?"
1635,2,Beautiful and old school between mario and sonic however enjoyment is more on the frustration level. Not the game but using the loose controller and at times could turn the controller into a flying dog house.  No game settings. Maybe the new xbox one elite controller could tame this puppy. For the price game is intended for a child but takes a vrry patient adult to continue to smile. Im not smiling
1636,2,bought on sale on ORIGIN ($20) i'd say its worth about $15
1637,2,"The sound quality was excellent. I also thought the headphones were very comfortable.

The Mic was a disaster for me. It broke in 15 days.

I would recommend this headset for anyone who doesn't use Vent or another voice service to play games. if you just use your headset for sound then I would recommend these. The sound quality ranks up there with the best headsets I own but the Mic is a total joke."
1638,2,"I bought this strictly for the Sega side. I have yet to try the NES part.
The video has a subtle wavy pattern to it.

It doesn't show up so much on a small analog TV, but if you plug it into
a newer digital TV, it gets wavy. My original Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 don't
have the wavy issues.

Also the sound is just plain horrible. It crackles like a cheap stereo. I have tried
this system on several TVs and always the same thing.

I didn't think NHL 94 beats could get worse, but on this system it hurts your ears.

I did like the controllers. We have a lot of NHL 94 tourneys and everyone likes
to play with these controllers. These controllers will not fit the regular Sega.
They shaped them differently."
1639,2,"I really wanted to like this game. I've been looking forward to a racing game on the PS4 since launch, and Drive Club was extremely disappointing, and unfortunately this game doesn't live up to the hype either. Here's the deal: Many of the reviewers point out the lack of offline features, and although that's a mistake on the developer's part, people knew this coming in. So for the sake of argument, let's pretend I enjoy always being online and don't dwell on the fact that during a race I simply can't leave the room for a second using the pause function that exists practically in every game in existence - with the exception of MMOs. Let's say I can tolerate the horrid AI that unfairly rubberbands past the car mashup it caused 2 miles back, and passes me around the second to last bend to win the race. And for a second, let's hold it together and.. never-mind, the last two points pretty much made this game the 2 stars it deserves.

I enjoy everything about the series, and Underground 2 and Most Wanted were the pinnacle of greatness when it came to arcade racing, so like many of us, I looked forward to the various combinations of previous games to form the latest release. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to smile about when playing this game. The cars are gorgeous, the touge is really fun to drift through (otherwise, the whole LA thing is really overplayed), the selection is passable - they really should have included more models, no 04-07' STi? Bummer.. Kudos on the MR, though. The constant cellphone going off every second is beyond annoying - and although many reviewers expressed a growing adoration for the characters, I just found it really cheesy and ended up skipping scenes to avoid the same replayed content with different dialogue.

+Great graphics
+Great customization
+Touge drifts are exciting
+Different challenge types keeps the game feeling fresh
+Money is relatively easy to come by
+Handling is great, as is the ability to fine-tune your car for grip/drift, fantastic feature.

-Music, NFSU 1-2 had great tracks - I felt the rush while driving. It's just background noise in this iteration
-Always online, need I say more.
-Terrible AI
-Tiny car selection, you didn't include dashes - shouldn't have skimped on cars.
-LA again? really?
-Police chases are boring, I had to constantly stop and let the police catch up, and then fish for more. Roadblocks were useless. Extremely disappointing considering this was a great selling point for the title.
-In-game players don't care to play with you; it's a racing game where the rewards for winning a race against you aren't incentivized enough to motivate the player to choose you over the story, or doing time trials, or event. Playing this game for 15 hours, I've realized how single player it really is, ironically while online. If you're playing with your Crew, it might be a different setting altogether. And maybe the issue isn't helped with so few players on such a large map.

Overall, 2/5. There's definitely things I really enjoyed while playing. It's not by any means unbearable, and you'll find yourself really taken by the level of detail, the constant changing weather, and seeing that random stranger pass you by as they wipe out, but there's just too many problems that overshadow what could have been a great game. I don't feel a sense of story or purpose, I just jump from race to race, and although we can make the argument this is racing, and purely that, there's still a creative approach to tying your sense of drive into the game, and making you feel connected.

Like most of you, I'll play this for a week or two, realize my investment has paid off, and sell it to Gamestop."
1640,2,"This game is complete garbage. The FPS genre needs to reevaluate itself for this current gen.

Muddy graphics, the graphics don't pop out, so everything looks like a clustered mess.

This is essentially a BF4 expansion being sold to you at the price of a full game.

Boring progression rate."
1641,2,"I've been a Silent Hill fan from the begining, so being the owner of a bright and new, shiny PSP, this purchase seemed like a no brainer after I did a little research on the item. It features the entire comic collection (similar to the Metal Gear Solid Graphic Novel on UMD), some select songs from the games' sound tracks, and some behind the scens stuff for the SH movie... but in the end, it just felt more like a seperate ""special features"" disk for the movie, rather than a special treatment for the Silent Hill series. The comics were, in my opinion, disapointing, having thin, nearly laughable, plots, poor characters, and very little to do with the Silent Hill mythos or the games. The behind the scenes features for the movie were interesting at best, but felt limited, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it all included with the DVD release of the lack-luster film any ways. The songs are the only redeeming feature for this title, but instead of including the collection of stunning soundtracks in their entirety, we are treated to only about four or five songs from each of the game titles. In short, this really is just a collection of the worst parts of Silent Hill, in my honest and unflinching opinion. Were I a new comer to the series and started with this, I would be hard pressed to pick up an actual game. I am praying that the actual portable ""Silent Hill Experience"" will be the release of the up coming Silent Hill Origins, but as for this title, for the hard core completists only."
1642,2,"I would have given this game 4 Stars if it wasn't for the final boss the demon in worldheart. I am stuck there with 4 health potions NO GOLD AND NO TAINTED BLOOD to make me more potions. Wish I had known that there are no merchants in this chapter. Can't even go to an earlier saved spot because one is somehow overwritten and both are now worldheart.
How can I beat this boss with 5 health potions??????
This sucks all this time and still can't finish the game not even when I switch to easy the 5 are not enough.
Make sure you got enough potions before you go to worldheart or the game is ruined and you have to start from the beginning.
For me I will just trade this stupid game in and I am not going to start again.
This ruined the whole game for me."
1643,2,My son Loves the sonic game controller that we plug into the tv so I got him this to play on his ds. I loved sonic as a child but when i tried to play the game it wasn't responding to my commands and frooze alot which made me die all the time. its annoying and almost unplayable.
1644,2,"This game is very fun on the Dreamcast and GameCube, and still fairly good on the PC. I imagine it would be on the Xbox as well, sadly I don't know because it literally CANNOT be played without some heavy-duty legwork.

When this game came out, it required an Xbox Live account. This wouldn't be a problem, except that Live for the original Xbox is gone. And unlike the Dreamcast and GameCube versions, you HAVE to be connected to Live to even boot up the disc to the main menu. Even offline play requires a connection!

And when it WAS working, you'd be paying around $170 a year to play online, combining the cost of Live in the first place and the purchase of a $10/month license.

Yes, there are workarounds, but most involve a modchip or require you to have a ""Linux box"". The only one which works at all needs an old XBL account on a memory card or the hard drive itself, which are becoming increasingly hard to find considering that no new accounts can be created.

I was wondering why the Xbox version of this game was so cheap, and now I know. Thanks to some very poor marketing and design decisions by both Microsoft and Sega, this game is literally impossible to play for about 99% of Xbox users. It isn't even compatible at all with the Xbox 360!

Please, unless you KNOW you'll be able to play this, spend the extra dough and get the GameCube version (or the Dreamcast, if you don't care about splitscreen and Episode II). This is almost worthless even to collectors."
1645,2,"UPDATE:  November 21 - Sniper button used to be nice and tight.. now it's pretty loose and makes an annoying rattle whenever slightly touched.  Not sure if this is just how it goes with this type of button/mouse, but it's extremely annoying.  Docking another star off for this since it's only been a few months.

I've only owned it for about a month but it seems pretty strong and well built so far. The construction feels wayyy better than the razer 2014 naga that I was using.

I purchased the white version and quickly exchanged it for the black... I would NOT recommend the white version.  The light bleeds through the M1 and M2 buttons making it look very tacky and the texture is complete trash.

The mouse is pretty heavy with all the weights taken out.
The lights are really nice and being able to change them to basically any colour is amazing.
I've only accidentally hit the snipe button a few times, but I've adjusted.
I have a fingertip and some times palm grip so the buttons work for me.

I'm taking stars off because the mouse has NO internal memory for the light settings or the DPI settings. I think this is a huge flaw.  If you don't have the corsair software installed, the mouse will use its default settings.  That's not a deal breaker, but having to wait for your PC to boot up and then wait for the corsair software to load up is very annoying.  I own the k70 LUX and it does have internal memory.. dunno why they didn't give the M65 PRO RGB the same treatment.

If they release an updated version with internal memory that will save the user preferences, I'm going to sell this and buy the newer version.

EDIT:  After many months of using this mouse.. or rather the black version (exchanged for the black)  I've decided that the mouse is WAY too heavy... Prob gonna switch to the new logitech mouse with the same sensor.  I really like the ergonomics of this mouse, the buttons, and just the over all look and shape.. but it's soo heavy.  I honestly don't know why it came with weights to make it EVEN heavier.."
1646,2,"This is the first inFamous game that I played, and I hope that the original was better. I rented this from Gamefly and it lasted about an hour before I gave up and put it in the return envelope.

Pros:
The idea of having multiple super powers is enticing

Cons
The control scheme is completely foreign. You'll need to unlearn any other game control scheme that you've know and learn this one to play the game.
The gameplay is very unbalanced. You will dance around enemies like a ballerina until you run into an unstoppable enemy that completely halts your game progression. Look, either I'm superman, or I'm not. Another analogy would be to have a super car for the 1st four laps of a five-lap race., then on the fifth lap the game swaps the Ferrari for a Yugo and you end up losing.
The story does not engage you. It wants you to become immersed in the game as make either light or dark decision with real consequences, but since you don't care about anyone around you, it really doesn't matter what you do.

Could this have been a fun, engaging title. Instead it plays more like an alpha version of the game where they have yet to figure out what kind of game they want it to be. Development of the story, the characters, better control scheme, and balance that results in a well paced game are missing here.,

My recommendation: Do not buy or rent."
1647,2,"I wouldn't say I was super hyped for the game but I believe Blizzard was on their game when it comes to both balance in the game itself but more importantly the mechanics outside of the game.  The matchmaking system, not including the team composition, is a rather horrible mix of World of Warcraft and StarCraft II.  The 6 v 6 is very similar to WoW dungeons (tanks, heals, DPS) in which to really get the game to its peak you'd need at least 8 or so friends to get a good team (more or less like raids, one won't get the same people on every single time, etc.).  While this is merely my speculation I've noticed that Blizzard is locking me in with a 50/50 win ratio which is how they approach StarCraft II's ranking systems.  Win 10 games?  I WILL definitely lose the next 10-15 games.  I don't mean like 'it was so close' sort of losing but the flat out being grouped with people who, despite being level 40+, have no idea how to play Overwatch and assume it's a free for all.  Admittedly I don't have many friends who play Overwatch and my neighbor says he got tired of how absurd trying to get that one 'First Win of the Day' is.

Pros:
-Great graphics, characters and designs.
-Runs nearly flawlessly on my older Core 2 Quad with a GeForce 660 series card.
-When in a good group, especially when the matches get tense and we lose anyway, it's still enjoyable.
-While it does not support LAN the game does have nicely designed spectator UI for custom games.  It's great to know that they've got the competitive framework in place and it's easy to watch tournaments and understand what is going on (namely, the spectator is third person with health bars showing all players on the top).
-Mostly balanced, although there are a few paper, rock, scissors matchups to avoid.
-While it's still easy to break apart teams in Quick Play I've noticed players who understand how to properly utilize their class tend to have a very nice synergy.

Neutral:
-Blizzard has implemented a system to where if a player quits so many games they get a penalty of reduced experience.  I can imagine the lack of a concede is probably because it is possible to still win, despite all odds.
-To make the game more entertaining there is an overtime styled sudden death.  If time runs the match is placed in overtime if the losing team has the slight probability of overtaking the winning team.  Of course, who finds it great would vary on the match obviously.

Cons:
-Blizzard should of taken it a step further and added a sort of ""guild"" or ""roster"" system to where players can have a premade group that they can join and leave at will.  Currently trying to get a group going requires everyone to be at the menu with no way to try and queue with a friend outside of simply joining their game (which, not only does the game split us up afterwards but I'm generally playing against them) if something is in progress.  I don't mind waiting 4 minutes to join a friend rather than 16 trying to figure out how to align our matches.
-There is way too much time spent on the character select screen at the beginning of a match.  On maps that are not capturing the point the attacking team can wait up to 2 minutes before getting into the game (that is, sixty seconds for the round to start as well as 40 seconds at the character select...Providing it does not reset).
-It really has nothing to keep me playing.  As great as the game was when it came out after two weeks I find myself only putting in less than an hour into it on a daily basis.  Unless I can get a nice premade group it's too difficult to get into.
-I am not a big fan of statistics on Quick Play.  I can obviously understand it competitively but it's meaningless otherwise (and like WoW an eyesore).  I'd not even care about losing if the total number of games isn't recorded.

Edit: This review predates the new Competitive system, so I don't know if they did add a team system."
1648,2,The map navigation killed this game for me.  Spent so much time trying to follow the map to turn in quests. I saw on the forums that others complained about this too. People were calling them lazy. I might be lazy or even stupid but I just couldn't spend so much time looking for a NPC to turn in a quest. The quest navigation totally sucks.  Combat is slow and clunky but I could deal with that but not the extra half hour to find the area I needed to be at to do the combat. Not worth the subscription.  Buy to play?  Maybe I would try harder but probably not.
1649,2,"When it comes to reality shows, none has seen the heaviest light than Dancing With The Stars. The ABC smash has really proven to light up the floors. But, there is such a feeling of disbelief, when a successful show has to become a video game. That high make it become an easy low, after the dissapointing feel reality shows turned to video games like American Idol and Survivor. That is sad, because the feeling of the game doesn't excite people to make their moves well. Now, that has shown as Dancing With The Stars makes it debut for the video game market, and on the Nintendo Wii, and to tell you the truth, this isn't worth saving the last dance for.

Dancing With The Stars for the Nintendo Wii, takes on the ABC reality dance competeition into a spinning train wreck. The Activision company, which has delivered well with musical success with Guitar Hero, fails to win over gamers. The gameplay works just like the show, as you play with previous contestants like past winners Emmit Smith, or fan favorites like Saved By The Bell actor Mario Lopez, with the dancers like Cheryl Burke, as you dance your way towards the judges hearts. The graphics fare well, but the gameplay doesn't actually shine here, unlike Dance Dance Revolution which worked well with the dance pad, here you don't actually have as much movement as you do with the Wii remote, unlike the Playstation 2 edition, which delivers better by actually making you dance to your hearts content. You can perform flair moves by simple use of the Wii controller, but it doesn't show that it shines well to gamers young and old.

All in all, Dancing With The Stars is a great reality show, but it sadly misses the mark as really great music game. You're better off with Guitar Hero III instead for the Wii, as a game that really rocks on. I also hope the next time a reality show makes it way into being a video game, it doesn't feel like it is lesser of a game, than the actual show like this one shows.

1650,2,"If only Midway would put more thought into their games, this could have been one of the best games for the GBA.  First off this is an exact copy of the 16 bit versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which isn't a bad thing, but the translation to the GBA could have been done much, MUCH more better, and what we have is a game that feels unfinished.  The graphics are bland, very bland.  The characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky.  The moves aren't as easy to pull off as you might think, and yeah they take practice to pull off, but they could have been made much better.  All in all, Mortal Kombat Advance isn't worth the asking price, but its not a completely bad game, just buy it when you find it in a bargain bin."
1651,2,"Counter-Strike was or maybe still is, according to wikipedia, the most popular FPS played over the internet. Either it must be free, or people have never seen Halo.

Made by Valve (makers of Half-Life -- an infinitely better game) using a modified Quake engine. It's basically a multiplayer-based tactical shooter a lot like Rainbow Six, which looks and also is, infinitely better. Many of the weapons and items in CS are also used in Rainbow Six...

This game is ugly, flat, colorless and lifeless. It's also frustrating. A couple hits and you're dead and you then you must sit there and wait until the other players are dead or the game is over...There really isn't much to this game.

If you want good multiplayer for the xbox or 360, get Halo, Halo2, or Unreal Tournament (a multiplayer-based game). These games have many more options, are more fun, and just plain look better.

If you want a good game made by Valve for the xbox or 360, play Half-Life2 until the OrangeBox comes out.

And if you want to play something that feels like CS for the xbox or 360, play Rainbow Six 3 or Rainbow Six Vegas.

And lastly, if you want to play a cornball crappy looking multiplayer game like this, but have a lot more maps and weapons, try Red Faction II. It's not very good either, but at least not as bad as this..."
1652,2,The disc and everything was fine. The game sucked. Should have titled it Far Cry 2.5. No improvement to game mechanics and little to graphics. Too bad because the story was pretty great considering.
1653,2,"Okay, I can understand why some people might rave about this game, because the graphics are really, really pretty and might be a bit overwhelming.  But one you start playing, I don't see how anyone could give this game an above-average (or even average) rating.  The controls for the main character are clunky, the 3-D mapping leaves a lot to be desired, and the weapons controls are pretty unimpressive.  The plot itself is uninspired, and involves the following formula: A) Walk down creepy corridor, B) Kill Event-Horizon rip-off critter, C) Emerge into a lab, D) Repeat step ""B"" multiple times, E) Move something with your mind, F) Go back to the beginning, G) Go to next level, H) Repeats previous steps.  Seriously, this is one of the most linear games I've ever seen, and I was completely bored with it after just a couple of hours."
1654,2,"When Need for Speed Hot Persuit 2 failed to deliver, I turned toward the X-Box Sega GT 2002. After 2 straight hours of playing this game in the store I was hooked.
 However, when I bought the X-Box and came home with the game, I found that after many more hours of play, the game can become very, very frustrating. Once inside career mode you can buy a cheap car and upgrade it for a slight performance difference. Once you've won a few races you can buy other cars or maybe you want to play in the Official Races.
 The Official Races were a complete mistery to me and after getting my B Licence, I wish I would have never played them. All the Licence's seem to do is make the difficulty go up as well as the cash for winning a race. However, the rate at which difficulty goes up is not matched by the money. By the time you hit B Licence, you'll find the CPU Car's shooting way ahead of you from the beginning of the race and cornering at speeds you'd never be able to, even though they may have the same car as you with the same spec's. This is a very cheap way of making the game harder. The worst part about it is once you gain licences, your screwed and can't go back to old licences (difficulties) unless you start over.
 One thing that you learn early in this game is that research doesn't help much. After researching the best car to buy out of all the cars available for $27,000-30,000 price range, I found that the Camero was the best buy. Sure enough it ran well in the races, about as well as any of the other cars.
Oh and did you know, Damage is inexistant! No damage modeling in this game what so ever, atleast none that I can see. The only form of ""damage"" is a meter in the top right of the screen that says how much health the car has left before you hit ""max damage"". What max damage means, I have yet to find out, since you can race with max damage on just as well as you can with perfect health. Also physics are pretty nill when it comes to bumping around with other cars. Bumping against another car will make your health go down just as fast as if you plow straight into a wall. Yet the car still appears to be untouched.
In short I was ready to chuck my new X-Box out the window the day after I bought it because of this game.
However, if you are able to look past these problems, you will find beautiful graphics and a fair sound track. The game interface is only mediocre.
Yet I pledge my word that on the [money] I spent on this system, I will attempt to see only the good side of this game, in which case this game is a small piece of heaven, very very small.

1655,2,"Get the Hori pad for MKX, it's so much better.  The hori feels and plays like a PS4 controller but just a bit more comfortable."
1656,2,"At times, I find the entire 'puzzle' genre suffering from a misnomer. Puzzle titles often feel more 'twitch' than cerebral. Tetris catalyzed this genre's marriage of pattern-recognition with near-instantaneous player reaction, which has long since become the primary element of games from Dr. Mario to Bust-A-Move. The reason Tetris remains the archetype for the genre is lost on a game like Zoo Keeper; in a round of Tetris, the player is always 'building' their game, despite the mound of blocks being constructed only to then be skillfully eliminated from play. Games that successfully model the Tetris experience ooze a sense of control and personality.

Zoo Keeper keeps it simple, but not in the refreshing, Spartan manner of its superior competitors. The gameplay consists of you switching the position of two adjacent animal icons in order to make a 'capture' of three straight animals. Variants of this game abound (for historians, this is the Sega `Columns' genealogy); there are several online derivations, but often they challenge you to clear the screen - thus, a puzzle with a solution. No such goal in Zoo Keeper; in the main mode, you play until retinal failure. They count on the quirky presentation to get you in the door, what with the intransigent balding Zoo Manager and a slew of blocky, impossibly cute zoo creatures.

While any constant visual input can be mildly engaging, Zoo Keeper ultimately feels like a game one would find free-of-charge on Yahoo games (""Bejeweled,"" to be precise). Primarily, I question how much gameplay exists beyond the simple recognition of available moves. The game's puzzle mode would have you believe that there is something resembling deeper gameplay here involving combos and chains, but the nature of the constantly refreshing screen (pieces fall from above as they are eliminated from the playing field) lend this game a degree of randomness that belies any sense of planning. Granted, maybe I'm just not apt enough at reading the entire screen as a whole, but this game delivers scant satisfaction when the occasional 10-chain hits the board. How much does the player have to do with the chains when they are so often supplied by the pieces randomly falling from the top of the screen? A Zoo Keeper Zen state would be about as interesting as mastering a word search puzzle, your eyes blurred on a field of letters.

There have been times in life in which I have sought out fairly mindless diversions such as Zoo Keeper; the modicum of skill they award, combined with the hypnotic gameplay and eye-darting around the screen, can produce a pleasantly thoughtless state (a state I enjoyed in avoiding my undergraduate work). At the end of the day, this game dutifully serves its function of wasting your free time."
1657,2,"Average graphics, Short missions, Incredibly repetitive, Filled with pointless collectibles, and lacking in terms of content and replay value. Without a doubt, Indiana Jones is one of the most disappointing Lego games I have played. It's so painfully generic, It completely ruins the game."
1658,2,"In a previous review of this product, I railed against what I thought was a bit of a lie on the part of the manufacturer.  Hailed throughout the industry as a model of open-ended play, MORROWIND, I thought, had a surprisingly linear ending.  That being a fairly important issue, I decided to devote a whole review to it.  But there's more to Bethesda's new baby.
Or, rather, there's more to warn you about.
If you like quests, you'll love the core game play itself.  But soon enough, I think, you'll find many of these quests so much busywork.  Worse, some of them paint inconsistent pictures of the characters you meet:  one minute they behave as benefactors, the next they're basically asking you to steal or murder.  Truth is, there's not a lot of plot-driven logic to most of these quests.  While they do gradually reveal the mystery of the Main Quest to your character --in a more-or-less satisfying way--they don't particularly make sense from the perspective of the characters that order you around.  Take the Mage's Guild as an example.  According to the rules of the Guild, you're not supposed to steal from a fellow Mage.  But several quests revolve around you doing just that.  You fail the quest, and get kicked out of the Guild, if the theft occurs in plain sight.  But if you carry it out covertly, you're golden.  Theft only matters, it seems, if others are watching.
If you're into exploring the world of a game, MORROWIND does a better job than just about any game out there of letting you go anywhere, and rewarding you for your curiosity.  You'll love finding little towns and all the small stories happening against the backdrop of the overarching ""Main Quest"".  You'll probably be amazed the first time you see day dusk into night, or the way rain grows from a sprinkle to a thunderous downpour.  The weather/time module is probably the most advanced on the market, and you'll simply marvel at how precisely the developers have caught the sun's progress over the course of a day.  Indeed, this, more than any other aspect, is probably what will keep you playing.  But all this is not without its price.  The extreme intricacy of the environment, combined with the detailed growth your character is undergoing leads to a very buggy game.  It's just too much stuff, somehow.  I've never had a game that so regularly crashes my Xbox.  Yeah.  You heard that right:  CRASHES.  This game does everything from completely freezing up during an intense fight, to stopping in the middle of saving a game (ouch!), to randomly bouncing back to the opening Xbox title screen.  There is, it seems, a price for being the most ambitious title ever released.
And you get charged that price not only in crashes, but in errors throughout.  Here's a partial list of bugs I've encountered:
* Spelling errors everywhere.  This game relies on text.  The developers should've relied on a spell checking program and several copy editors.
* Movement errors at random times.  My character gets stuck all the time.  That is, she behaves as if there's something blocking her progress.  When I switch to the third-person perspective, it's obvious there's nothing that should be holding her up.  She's just ""stuck"", and the only solution is re-loading the last saved game.
 Items magically duplicate themselves in your inventory.  The best/worst example of this is with some of the items that make potions.  I had a particularly expensive item that would grow every time I selected it.  At last count I had over 100 of these items in my inventory, and there's no sign that the bug has an upper limit.  Since these items are worth about 4000 gold each, I've basically found an endless supply of money, thereby ""crashing"" the economy of the game.
* A hopelessly disorganized inventory.  Once you get to the point you can carry, say, hundreds of potions, you'll know how frustrating it is to try to find one of them.  They're not alphabetized.  They're not sortable according to any quality.  They're just in the order they're in.  Trying to find a potion can break the flow of an otherwise adrenaline-rushing fight.
* Framerate sometimes sucks.  Oh how it sucks.  Get into a fight with multiple magic-casters and you'll see what I mean.  Even on the Xbox, which can handle complex fights well, MORROWIND can sometimes unintentionally slip into serious slo-mo.
Bottom line:  don't buy this version of the game thinking you're going to escape the bugs that are rampant in the PC version.  It's buggy, regardless of platform.
But  the game's biggest failing, to me, is the inability to play more than one character  at a time.  I'm not really talking about the lack of multiplayer.  No, I mean that you can't have more than one player in any one game state.  Many other RPGs allow you exit one character and bring up another in the same game state, allowing you to experiment with different character types without losing your basic progress towards the accomplishment of the game's goals.  Here, once you've picked your character, you have to play it to the end.  Given the length of time it takes to finish this game, most people will,  therefore, only scratch the surface of game play.  If you find, midway through the game, that you'd like to switch from being a hack-and-slash barbarian to a potion-making magic user, you're out of luck.  You'd actually have to start a brand new game to do so.  And most people just don't have the TIME to start over.
In sum, then, MORROWIND is a fascinating, if deeply flawed, title.  I so desperately want to like it that I've written two reviews of it.  But at the end of the day I feel like I've just wasted more time than I've enjoyed.  At most, it's worth renting for a week to see what all the fuss is about."
1659,2,Not what i Thought !
1660,2,"OK, so I finished Dantes Inferno and it kicked butt! I then popped in GOW3 and saw how similar it was in fighting styles.  However, Dantes fighting and the smoothness of the graphics blows away GOW3.  GOW does have some really cool scenes and ideas, but the horrible game play made me frustrated and I turned the game off and will never play it again."
1661,2,"Who doesn't like Phineas and Ferb?  My son laughs at the kid jokes and I laugh at the older kid jokes.  Why wouldn't we want to try Phineas and Ferb on the Wii U?
Probably because it falls short of what the Wii U can do.  It's a port, through and through.  The voice acting, music, and sound effects are right from the show, but the graphics are water-down, original Wii quality at best.  It could have looked a lot better.  Worse, the controls are cumbersome, and frustrating.  If you don't jump ""just right"" when trying to scale a wall, you'll find yourself attempting the same jump two or three times.  The kicker - you jumped fine the first time, but you were one centimeter too far to the right to clear the edge, forcing you to bounce back to the left.  Poor game programming crept into this port.  After about 10 minutes, it ceased being very fun.  Another $30 wasted.  This last game had made me seriously consider selling the whole lot of the ill-thought out Wii U gaming system on ebay."
1662,2,"I rarely give up on games, but I had to with Deer Drive Legends. There's no one I can recommend this thing to. People who like hunting games, people who like to shoot things, people who were abused by deer when they were young...no one out there is going to like this game enough to play it for more than 30 minutes. The only reason you should ever get this game is if you gave it to someone you don't like, and want to really insult them.

Normally I'll go on and on about the item in question with my reviews. Not here. I don't want to waste any of my time, or yours. Awful controls make trying to get accurate kills a god awful mess. I've played a couple of good shooters on the standard DS, and this is the kind of thing that is better played at home or an arcade cabinet. Really, if you have a ps3 or 360, just spend a few bucks more and get one of the Cabela games. They're a heck of a lot more fun than this disaster.

The only thing keeping Deer Drive Legends from getting a 1 star rating from me? Well, aside from the deer on the cover of the box making me laugh when I first saw it, the graphics and sounds are ok. Nothing to write home about, but they were surprisingly better than expected. This is such a budget title, and they could've dumped out visuals that rivaled the Nintendo 64's capabilities, but didn't.

Don't buy this game. Think of your dignity."

I mus have played through half the game on my first go before I finally died and that was because I wanted to see what it took to finally get killed. Man I was disappointed with this crappy game. Please spend you money of COD4 if you don't already have it, if this game is worth $60, COD4 is worth $600 in comparison"
1665,2,"i bought this and the company hasn't refund this awfully boring game. No multiplayer online, nor offline, and no direct control of your sim so you constantly loose track of the sim. There are cool things like less loading screens and more than 2 people conversations but that isn't enough to make this game enjoyable."
1666,2,"... and not nearly long enough. This game feels like it should have been a ""FREE"" download. It's a very brief look into the lives of 5 unrelated characters to the previous episodes. Obviously this is just a cash in game to cash in on the hype of the 5 episode Game of the Year or whatever. The Walking dead is good at establishing story but extremely short on being an actual game. It's point and click mayhem with little more than quick time events to glue it together. The choices you make also matter little in the direction that your story goes as the only influence you really have is to slightly change the dialogue between characters. Why did I bring that up? Because 400 days is nothing more than few ""short stories"". Where you mostly ""watch"" what happens to a few characters with the same point and click scenarios that don't mean diddly."
1667,2,"This is one game I'm glad I rented instead of bought.  I just couldn't get into this game.

It's tough to get the proper balance if you're making a strategy game that includes actual first person fighting.  Strategy games involve a lot of micromanaging of your units and it's hard to do that if you're sitting in a cockpit.  The game basically tries to do too much.  The interface and controls always felt awkward to me even after I'd been playing for hours.

The graphics aren't terrible, but are a little weak for a xbox 360 game."
1668,2,"Visually this game is terribly lacking. The car models are swarmed with nasty looking jaggies that I've never seen before in previous car games on the PSX. The models look somewhat decent, but their outward appearance is very grainy, thanks to the jaggies. Not exactly very nice car detail, and I'm frankly disappointed. The environments are very shabby, they flicker like crazy and on top of that look downright pixilated. When you look at the floor, or the backgrounds you should notice how incredibly ugly everything looks, it makes me even wonder if Eutechnyx spent any time on the game from E3 2000 up until the release date. The frame rates are fine, but at times may act up, and don't get me started on the pop-up 'cause this game is right up there with Driver 2. The game's collision detection is also a pile (...), and the overall look of the visuals looks hardly alpha staged, the only good thing I can say about the visuals is that they move and there are colors, otherwise everything else, including special effects look like demo titles running on a first wave PSX tool-kit. But I must admit that the CGs are some of the best in any PS game yet.
  The concept of the game is quite good, only if it was better executed. You are James Bond of course, except you are Pierce Brosnan not Sean Connery or the other Bonds, that is bad impact number one. The game's plot is totally unrealistic, you will see Pierce Brosnan in every single vehicle, including a DB5 and tons of other classic Bond vehicles. I believe that it was a stupid move by the developer to only put Pierce Brosnan in 007 Racing, because true Bond fans will be completely turned off by the game. Losing some critical points there, 007 Racing also suffers from un-balanced and boring missions, such as picking up people, shooting down a helicopter with only one try, escorting this person, that person, blah, blah, blah. By the second mission you'll definitely notice what kind of horrendously boring product your playing. If you folks want to know, there are 15 missions to complete, all of which are explained to you in a mission briefing, but none that I would like to listen to. There are a few decent stages, take for example the Highway Hazzard, what you do here is you follow an 18-wheeler and your goal is to pop the wheels on the truck using a hi-tech device. In case you're wondering, the two-player missions need not to be played, you just won't have any fun with them at all. Some of the weapons that James Bond will use are missiles, homing missiles and machine guns, he will be able to use shields and replenish his lives by picking up health kits. Through the game you will be taken through tons of different areas such as New York, Louisiana, Eastern Europe, and Monte Carlo. 007 Racing is a lacking game with a great concept, if only the developer had taken time to balance out the missions, and perk up the visuals, we could have had a great game, but there is always the PS2 version which is currently under development.
  Audio is decent, but the songs are far too repetitive and can annoy the heck out of you. The voice acting on the other hand is quite good, but it seems as if Q would rather have the returned in one piece instead of having James back healthy. While playing the game you'll hear Q commenting on your performance, and may give you some hints at times. Most of the time the voice acting is found during the mission briefings by M and they can be quite long, but the clarity is good though so there isn't anything painful to be dealt with. Not bad audio effects, but if the soundtrack was worked on we could have had something much better.
  Controls are just too sloppy, every time I try to make a turn it feels like the emergency brake has been hit. The cars have absolutely no realistic feel to them at all, so car enthusiasts must look elsewhere. I'll give the game its nice analog features, both analog sticks work and they have a good deal of sensitivity. I honestly can't say much more about the controls, other than that they feel very sloppy, there is no realism to speak off and the only thing that's good about the controls are the analog sticks.
  Sadly what was once a very promising game, turned out to be a miserable failure, 007 could have been a good game if its visuals were worked on more, because I know that PSOne can do so much better than this, the gameplay needs to adjusting and the controls should have been tightened up for better gameplay. With horrible graphics, unsatisfactory and tedious gameplay, and loose controls 007 Racing is barely worth a purchase, let alone a rental, just stay away from this game if you know what's good for you and the Playstation.

but it is bond after all so I suppose you will all buy it anyway"
1669,2,"I pre-ordered this game expecting it to be awesome.  I loved Mass Effect's original trilogy, apart from the ending and loved that my decisions did something in the universe.  I love the experience and the exploration theme of the game really made me happy.  Part of what makes Mass Effect great is the story.  I will try not to spoil anything for those who want to play.

If you are on the fence, I know you've heard about the facial animations.  You MIGHT be able to get this fixed in a patch / mod later on - but there is a huge issue with the writing on this game in general.  It is jarring, and prevents you form becoming immersed in the game.  You ARE your character in this game, and choices for dialogue mean a lot.  You are pigeon holed into feeling certain ways about a conversation.  In key moments of story where I wanted to tell my colleagues ""You can believe in me"" and the only options I got were to be pessimistic and ""Well, I can try, but I don't know"".

Another thing that really takes you out of the game is 10-20 second cut scenes any time you move from planet to planet - I can't get into this game.  I constantly find myself texting, looking for means to stop playing.  I don't think I'll get through this game - I just don't have the interest.  It really breaks my heart."
1670,2,At least it was cheap. I lost interest in the game very quickly. wouldnt reccomend it even at the price.
1671,2,"The charger does look nice but the one I got was defective, only one of the charger ports works. I would like to send it back but I don't have a printer to print out the label it asks me to so I can send it back."
1672,2,"Better than the first one, but I don't like it."
1673,2,I'm glad my brother in law had this so I got to try it before I through away $65.00 .i give 2 stars because it is beautiful. I hope all games start to look like this. There is no campaign and that is not good for me. I don't play games for the online stuff.if there is no campaign I will not buy. Fallout 4 rules baby yaa!!! .
1674,2,"When you see Call of Duty on a box,  you just expect it to automatically be good to great. This was certainly a surprise especially after a splash title like Call of Duty 4. You don't have expectations of it being better, the same or even a bit less, but not this bad. Did they change developers or change the original team? The only thing I can think of is they were in a huge hurry to get it out before Christmas and decided to go with a quick port from consoles. This would explain the muddy graphics and well not sure what to say about the storyline or game play. Sad to see this miss the mark, but after years of success, sometimes you get lazy and assume the name alone is worth the price. In this case, not."
1675,2,"I ended up selling this back after a few months. The game configurations only work for Steam games. Using them otherwise is very difficult and takes more time and effort than I was willing to spend. This may be for Steam afficianados or hard core gamers, but if you're a casual gamer like me, just pickup an Xbone controller."
1676,2,"I bought these after my Turtle Beach PX4 broke. The sound quality on the PX4 is a 10/10 where as the sound quality on the Ear Force Stealth is a 6/10
The Chat sounds like I am inside a tin can. The bass is better but only slightly. For games like GTA that have rich sounding explosions and multiple sound effects they don't perform well. I tried all 4 of the sound modes and they really don't make a noticeable difference.

Comfort... The ear cups are much smaller than the PX4. They barely cover your ear. If you wear glasses, It's hard to have the ear cups not push your glasses off your nose.

I waited until the Ear Force dropped below 100 to buy and I still feel these are poor quality.
I will process a return for these. They are NOT ""premium"" headphones at all. 7.1 dolby... NO WAY... Stereo only..."
1677,2,"Everyone's already commenting on the ridiculous, anti-consumer DLC policy so I'll skip that and just say that they're correct. But I got the game thinking, ""I don't have to pay for DLC so I won't.""

But the game itself just isn't compelling. Rounds seem to either be instant slaughters where the hunters trap the monster early before it can get strong enough to fight, or prolonged games of cat and mouse where the hunters trek endlessly around the map searching for any sign of a sneaking monster.

For every fun round you'll play three or four disasters, and that's just not a good enough return on the investment, regardless of whether you're willing to pay money just to change your gun from blue to a slightly different shade of blue."
1678,2,"What is going on with the creators of Assassins Creed?  For me, the jewel in Assassin's Creed's crown was ""Black Flag.""  It left me excited for the next game ""Rogue.""  Rogue was a step-down, but then came Unity.  A prelude that set the stage for extremely ""drab"" with Syndicate.  The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is for the ""architect"" of the external buildings and the trains, as well as it had far fewer glitches than Unity.  But even Unity had more exciting buildings to enter and things to do.

If it were not for my paying $60 for the new game at a local store, another $30 to download more content in hopes of something exciting happening, and $24 for a strategy guide that I absolutely did not need, I would've stopped playing it during Sequence 5.  Why?

It became tedious to repeatedly drive swaying stage coaches through similar looking streets.  In Rogue, the ships were awesome, battles happened on various seas and weather conditions, there were many ports to dock a ship, and etc.  The same ole' happens over-and-over with coaches.  It's very predictable.

There is very little of a mystical element to this game ... little to nothing of intrigue.  They resurrected historical figures to create story-lines that are so boring that if it were a TV series, I would flip to another station.

The top hat that Jacob can wear with an outfit is sssoooo ridiculous looking.  And the healed boots on Evie when she is running look so cartoonish and silly.  Their jaggedness of the bottom of their jackets were so distracting, but more so on Evie.  I wanted so much to remove her jacket and place her in flat boots throughout the entire game.

This game may have done it for me.  Without the variety of landscapes, the element of surprise, and the mystique of some previous Assassin's Creed games, I will not rush-out to buy the future installments until I've had a good look at what's being offered."
1679,2,"Poor molding quality leads to sticky buttons. I bought two and one was fine, the other... not so much. Basically what you should expect from Chinese electronics."
1680,2,"what you have here is a great portable system and a great game francise,so why is it that when they made a metel gear game for the PSP they didn't make a MG game with classic gameplay,which WOULD HAVE been a hit,but take a card based formula?

I don't see the DS coming out with a Mario game with card based gameplay...

I don't hate the game,i'm just saying it could have been something much,much,better"
1681,2,"If you like to sing, Rock Band 2 is better. When you sing on Rock Band2, it  shows you how close you are to hitting the right pitch. With Lips, it only lights up if you hit the right pitch, so it's not as much help in learning to sing the song perfectly on pitch.

You can do 'battles' with another singer, but you can't choose your own avatar when you do. So, you both look like monsters, one skinny with green hair and the other fat with blue hair. It's also confusing to figure out who's who.

I feel this has so much promise, but it's not there yet. And the songs... not that many... we're still figuring the proper format to upload our own music.

I like that it has the original music videos for the songs it offers though.

If you don't have Rock Band 2 you may like to check that one out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-Band-2/dp/B001BX6JUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock Band 2</a>"
1682,2,"First off EA took somthing that was perfectly good dating all the way back to playstation 1 and flushed it completely down the toilet. They made it like call of duty which is completely overrated to begin with. Secondly all the game gives you is four small measley health squares. If you get hit once thats one square gone. I tried playing it on ""Normal"" and died everytime. I completed one objective and it didn't save I died trying to get to another objective and had to start the mission all over again because it didn't save!"
1683,2,"Update.  I went back and played 98% of the game.  A TYPICAL linear game. A few great puzzles.  KILL was the same as a standalone game but a Lara Croft.  MY 2 Stars stands.  Note: I did notice the price is now $29.99!

I've played Tomb Raider since 1995!!!  It was an amazing puzzle solving, tomb exploring adventure with a side bar of characters all going for the same relics.  Up until 2000 Tom raider advanced and kept us excitied.  As all franchises it lost its way and became a Lost Raider.

Now 2013 this was to be the origin of Tomb Raider and Lara Crofts first adventure after college.  Well let me tell you all this is, is another FarCry with a girl.  Lara does minimum exploring and puzzle solving for the first 8% percent of this so called game. Lara is captured, tortured, escapes, recaptured, retortured, escapes recaptured.  etc.  She's shot at, beatin' killed(until you learn to escape (learn the button actions))  Now, Laras first understanding of Tomb Raising is killing, killing, killing to her way to Tomb Raider experience.

A very one sided one dimensional Legacy of Lara Croft.  Is how she learn the Tomb Raiding.  I'm Done.  Let the new naive genders continue this bull crap.

Fare Well Lara may there be better Guardians taking you forward!!

The Two Stars are for the beautiful Graphics and point system.  WHY ARE WE STILL IN A LINEAR WORLD.  THE NPC's ARE SMARTER BUT WE THE PLAYERS ARE STILL VERY LIMITED TO THE DESIGNERS NARROW BAND PLAY.  FREE WORLD WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE PLAYER REAL LIFE DECISION MAKING MOVES (LESS KILLING MORE STRATEGY)  THIS REMINDS ME OF 1995 TECHNOLOGY WITH 2013 GRAPHICS.

BOOO On YOU.  WHAT A WASTE !!!  Sorry Lara this is not worthy of you.  Goodbye Tomb Raider.  Rest in Peace."
1684,2,"I hooked up the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 to a Turtle Beach Ear Force X32 and I was sourly disappointed. I didn't notice any ""real"" Surround Sound difference. After playing with many presets and ""Surround Sound Angles"" I just couldn't get a good sound I liked that was true Surround Sound, it felt far more 3D than anything.

After looking extensively online, I noticed the Turtle Beach removed the  5.1/7.1 from the DSS2 packaging from the previous DSS which I found odd. The price was also lowered, which I found odd for an ""improved model"".

After a week I decided to return the product as I felt it wasn't good enough to justify the additional cost."
1685,2,"Watch Dogs is a frustratingly mediocre game. It could have been something unique but instead chose to be a generic open world action game. On top of that, the story is insipid. The main character is a worthless piece of human garbage. What? My sister is getting harassed by a prank caller? BETTER GO KILL HIM! Our hero, everybody. He lies, steals, murders and blows up property and has no sort of guilt about it. He tries to save people and then steals everything from their bank accounts. You get the idea. It could have been interesting if the main character wasn't portrayed as the hero. If it were like Breaking Bad or the Shield. Where the protagonist is a horrible person that you hate to root for. Sadly, the writers here couldn't manage that. Seeing their story play out, though, its hard to imagine how they even wrote a script. Hell, there is a mortality system in the game that has no real impact but simply tells you people either like or dislike the hero. All this could have been a little less awful  if it had an interesting message or actually did something cool with the hacking elements. Hell, we live in a world of constant surveillance. The subtext writes itself. But instead its a terrible story about cool guys using their hacking powers to stop an evil corporation...or other evil hackers. Hell, within the first few hours of the game lines like ""He set me up"" or ""I've been played"" are uttered and its not even remotely ironic.  Unfortunately hacking isn't very useful and almost every situation devolves into a generic shoot out quickly. Stealth is an option but its often difficult because of the game's wonky elements. The shooting elements are fine but nothing you haven't seen before. Graphically its solid, but not as good, but the visuals can't save this over all bland experience. Don't believe the hype. This game isn't worth your time."
1686,2,The picture is not very plain on all these
1687,2,"Great visuals and great sound, but gameplay went from mediocre in year one to flat out repetitive and boring in year two. I stuck with this game longer than it deserved hoping my investment of time and money would pay off, but at this point I'm finally ready to write the whole thing off and move on to something else. At least last year they had matchmaking for the vanguard strikes. This year a lot of the tougher levels require you to go on the internet and find people to squad up with."
1688,2,dosnt work in my computer it to old and see to play it in not fun if cant see play
1689,2,"This game is really boring and the combat is terrible, a typical rare game with great graphics and crappy gameplay. At least its not 1 of thier usual collectathons."
1690,2,"If you compare this game to hit and run, well... you just cant.  Do not paly this game after playing hit and run.  THis game is so unrealistic that it is boring.  You can play as a lot of different players and there are many different people to drive but it's just so repetitive.  In the road rage all you do is drive people back and forth.  They didn't even put time into making the level right.  in mission mode you do different missions, but once again they are very repetitive.  If your friend recommends this game (like mine) make sure to rent it before you buy it.  Because if you do buy it you will probably just end up selling it here.
rating out of ten: 2 1/2 - 3"
1691,2,"Logitech quality has went way down hill. This thing is new and rattles like it has been used for years. Also I had a G700- the battery would last for a 3-4 days, this one barely lasts a day....if I am lucky. When you use the hyperscroll, it wheel is so loose that you have to keep your finger on it, or when you move the mouse the page starts scrolling by itself...... very annoying. Was hoping to replace my old G700 with a new one, but this isn't even built with anywhere near the same quality.

Really can't recommend Logitech mice anymore, they just aren't what they used to be."
1692,2,"It was a nice gesture that Team Ninja recognized that Ninja Gaiden 3 was terrible and long-time fans were severely disappointed and wanted to fix this. Unfortunately, the game still has crippling flaws.

The storyline is complete garbage. Ninja Gaiden's never had a good storyline, but at least previous games kept the story minimal and it served as exposition. I'm okay with a storyline doing just that compared to what Ninja Gaiden 3 does: force an awful ""dramatic"" storyline down your throat as if it's good. The story calls into question whether or not Ryu Hayabusa is a hero. I don't see why I should question it because it's not as if Ryu has some ulterior motivation to stopping LOA and Regent of the Mask. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance does a much better job at calling into question whether or not the protagonist is really a hero because Raiden is much less the ""protector of the weak"" as he fashioned himself out to be; it was a personal vendetta against Desperado because he was a child solder in Liberia.

The bosses are really bad. Some of the bosses are just downright awful. You've got the infamous... ""mentally challenged"" dinosaur where you have to wait for the boss to trip over itself so you can attack it then you repeat that until the boss dies. You've got a battle with an aircraft that's really just an exercise in shooting your bow and QTEs for a ""cinematic experience."" Then you've got the final boss which is one of the worst that I've seen in a long time. It feels like either it wasn't tested or the developers forgot about the game's own mechanics. You have to charge up your meter to cast the new Ninpo you just got by killing waves of enemies. While you're doing this, purple bolts rain down on the roof of this building while the final boss slams her arm down to crush you. It takes quite a few kills to fully charge the spell. You're without Ninpo to heal yourself and Steel-on-Bone doesn't help much. It's challenging, and yes I completed it, but it's not a fun sort of challenging; it's just frustrating.

The game still has awful mechanics. Why does Ninja Gaiden need QTEs? I don't want to be mashing a button to perform some cinematic action. Essence is gone from corpses, so you can't chain UTs; you have to wait until you kill enough enemies for Bloody Rage. Muramasa's shop is gone. The game is painfully linear and backtracking to find scarabs or a skull is virtually impossible when areas lock behind you for no reason. You're reliant on Ninpo to heal yourself. I never liked having to use Ninpo in NG Black or NG 2 because of how easily they could kill everything, but now I need to use it to heal myself. Steel-on-Bone is now a grab-counter that heals you. When luck favors you, Steel-on-Bone just feels imbalanced with how you can instant-kill a number of enemies with ease when other times it feels like you have to rely on Steel-on-Bone to kill some enemies.

The only things I really enjoyed about the game are the Trials of Valor and the bonus characters to play with after you complete the story. Momiji and Ayane are really fun to play as. They play differently from Ryu with their unique weapons. The Trials of Valor are good fun in fighting your way through waves of enemies to fight a boss from NG Black or NG2. Sadly, one of the few times that Razor's Edge shines is when it uses content from previous games. Shame that characters that are enjoyable to play like Momiji and Ayane are part of such a terrible game.

If there's going to be a Ninja Gaiden 4, then Team Ninja as a whole needs to sit down and play through NG Black and NG 2 to see why those games are good as they are. Maybe then there will be some hope for Ninja Gaiden 4. Until, the franchise is dead."
1693,2,"I've had this mouse for about 4 months and the right button isn't responding anymore.  I like the feel of the mouse, but I expected it to last a lot longer than 4 months, given the price."
1694,2,"It worked for a few months and now has stopped. The one that came from nintendo still works great. In this case, I'd say pay the extra and get the real deal. This thing sucks :("
1695,2,"I got this despite the bad reviews because I thought, if anything, it would be a great game to kill some time when I get bored. Sadly, it can't even keep my attention long enough for that. I have played this a few times and each time I have to force myself to actually play the game. You can't do much besides price a few items in your shop. The items are large and look unnatural, on top of that the customers buy things literally at random with no reasoning behind it. I found the map that is in the game to explore to be very limiting and uninteresting. There are very few places to go and the places that the game does have are very poorly thought out. For example, you can go into a house and visit various rooms in the house....but there isn't much point in it because there is nothing in the rooms to interact with. The characters you do encounter say weird and random things that don't make much sense. I had a customer shout, ""I'm here!"" when I clicked them to interact. It's a sad attempt at what could have been a great game. The concept was cool, but I wonder how many days or weeks it took them to throw this title together. It sure doesn't feel like a game that was developed for very long...or tested for that matter. I recommend you save your money and don't get this one. I have games on my tablet that have more content in them than this one does."
1696,2,"yes i can see a graphic overhaul in the game for sure. why all the lock ups. i cant get threw one game without it locking up on me. they havnt come out with an update for it yet. passing is so hard to do on this, and as soon as you push the speed button all the defenders speed right to you lmao, if you ever notice when your in the huddle, the widereciever keeps running around the field LOL. it looks so not polished it is pathetic"
1697,2,"I like FPS games, while this doesn't advertise like one I still found it (2 hours in) redundant and only ok on the fun meter.  It's not scary at all, more frustrating as the guy moves so slow to run and/or turn around to fight.  And the whole 'must shoot off limbs' every time gets kinda old fast.  Maybe I'll try Dead Space 2 or 3 instead, but those look to be similar."
1698,2,"While it's nice to have a 500GB hard drive, I was disappointed to find this particular red color looks garish and ugly next to my other home theater components.  It stands out as a plastic eyesore, like a children's toy, and looks embarrassing and distracting next to my HDTV.

The top-loading disc drive means that nothing can be stacked on top of the unit, or even stood to the right side of the unit if mounted vertically on its ($15 extra) stand.  Like all of the new ""super-slim"" PS3 models, the Blu-Ray drive has no loading tray or slot, so you must reach down and pluck out the disc by hand, invariably getting fingerprints on the disc.  The process feels extremely awkward and cheap.

Lastly, the Amazon prices have dropped so low on these ""God of War"" games that you might save no money at all over buying each game individually."
1699,2,"If you are looking for a good racing game, look somewhere else. This game has great graphics, but the cars control like shopping carts. If you are looking for a game that is essentially the same thing but GOOD, go buy Midtown Madness 2. Otherwise all you racing fans better wait for Gran Turismo 2000"
1700,2,"This is my first time playing Dead or Alive.  I'm not a big fan of Tekken like games so I'll try to be fair as possible.  I can appreciate any fighting game that doesn't allow to much ""button mashing"".  What frustrates me is how this game is ridiculously TOO ACCURATE in the fighting scheme the makers of this game has employed.  I can read the manual so many times and even the online guides, but I barely get rewarded in trying execute self defense moves, especially the simple blocking.  I don't know if it's the game or my joints on my fingers aren't loose enough, but i swear that i barely get to do a counter hold on any combo..no matter how hard i time it well.  What frustrates me more is the blocking mechanism...it barely works and when it does it usually get overrided with a ridiculous ""blow"" or ""kick"" that launches you up and down to the ground.  And when do try to get up, it's hard to evade a cheesy low attack...you just have to absorb more until your lucky enough to reply with a little combo of your own.

I'll stop the ranting.  Would I recommend this to newcomeres of Dead or Alive?  No.  Most likely you'll be more frustrated than having fun.  I can't speak for the rest that have played this series for a while."
1701,2,A cheap game with bad controls and physics. I picked it up wanting a cheap beat 'em up game and that's all that it was.
1702,2,"ok, in CDS you play as four guys in the military, who are friggin' stupid. I mean, when you compare this to a game like

Socom, it starts to make you wonder, why am i even playing Desert Storm? The graphics.... horrible. They are N64 quality

and the cutscenes are just as bad as the graphics. Your teammates... not such a big help. When you tell them to hold their fire and a Iraqi is right next to them blowing their brains out, what do they do? Sit there getting shot. The game isn't realistic. When your shot in the face, your still alive. Sure it helps you but its unrealistic. And when you use an anti air craft missle thing and use it on the tanks, nothing happens!

I was never in the military but don't grenades damage tanks, and shooting them in the side should hurt them. But no. If you want to play desert storm, invite 3 friends over. Oh yeah, the menu screens... Craptastic! With the horrible presentation, bad ai, lack of realism and strategy leaves this game to warn people to probably rent it.... Or not

  2 out of 5"
1703,2,The control has a defect in the upper control lever does not work
1704,2,"I'd read the ratings on this and expected... so much more. It's been a while since I played this, but let's be clear. This game is like playing badly written anime with action that is targeted for a three year old.

I'd avoid. not worth it."
1705,2,"I remember playing this on my ps2 years ago and I thought I would break it out again. This has to be the worst game in reagards to controlling it. the story is excellent, but the controls are so lame, you can't control your characters actions especially  when driving. They did a good job with Mafia 2, but this original one is not good."
1706,2,"Wow--what a bad mouse.  It's super heavy in the back, making it difficult to move around.  It doesn't have enough buttons compared to other mice in it's category (should have at least one more to control the sensitivity of the mouse.  It's a bit small, so not as comfortable as other mice.

If you're interested in getting a much better mouse, try the Roccat Kone XTD or the Logitech G900."
1707,2,"I loved this mouse for about 4 months. I initially had the Molten edition. Then the scroll wheel started scrolling backwards (it would go down one notch and then back up with the next click of the scroll wheel, rendering it useless) and when I contacted Razer, they basically told me to screw off because I had purchased it from Best Buy and didn't have my receipt. Razer has let their customer service go, and the same for their quality. I purchased a regular naga to replace this one, (the original model) and it wore out in about 4 months too. Razer, even though I had my receipt, did not fix it, but simply mailed it back to me and said there was nothing wrong with it after making me pay for shipping. I had another naga given to me as a gift by a friend who bought a logitech G600 (buy that if you're looking for a mouse like this) and it was the 2012 edition, the green one. I have not had any real issues with this one so far except that when it is plugged in, I cannot use my bios. I have to unplug the mouse from my computer to access my bios settings. This is the only mouse I have ever had this issue with. The mouse is also too heavy. It has a weight in it which appears to be about 20 or 25 grams of solid metal, to give it more weight. The problem is, this weight is unnecessary. it causes extra glide and static friction. I removed this weight from my naga 2012 and it is so much nicer to use now. I do like that the naga 2012 has replaceable grips like the epic, because I very much like the comfort the palm grip brings. The side buttons are okay... I wound up using them a lot less than I thought I would, and probably should have just bought a mouse that had 3 or 4 extra keys instead of 12. The location of the mouse 4 and 5 keys is annoying at best, as you have to remove your finger from the left click to use them and they are behind the scroll wheel so it makes accessing them even more uncomfortable. Not only did I have issues with my Naga, but 2 of my friends did too. One had the same scroll wheel issue that I did, and another had an issue with the naga double clicking or the mouse button sticking in windows (the cursor would stay clicked even when the mouse button was released.) No small surprise here, they both were told they were out of luck by Razer support too. This could have been a great mouse, but Razer has let themselves go. 2/5 stars, would not recommend."
1708,2,"Little bit dumb on the combos. I just don't see putting all that time into learning all of them to where you can actually use them against a hard opponent. I really don't like the meter, and the moves that take half or all of it to execute. The moves list and some of the button symbology is completely non-understandable, and they don't explain it. For example: an arrow going straight right direction, but at the bottom of the analog. It's just stupid. The characters feel stiff and unresponsive, and most of them are dumb anyway. This seems like a kids game with a pokamon storyline or something, but it swears alot, so I don't know. Just kind of a retarded game, and it doesn't explain anything in depth. It expects you just to know what it's talking about. The fighting mechanics of the game are just dirt."

1710,2,Didn't realize that this was a knockoff SNES.
1711,2,Not real surround sound. Can't really tell what sounds are coming from where. I ended up selling them on eBay. The only good thing is that it has voice feedback meaning you can hear yourself talking thru the speakers so you know how you sound and if you're talking to loud. Tritton ax pros don't do that.
1712,2,"Like others have said it was missing items that it shows right on the package picture, and on the list of included items. Mine didn't include the cleaning spray, or the soft card."
1713,2,"Anyway, read styx138's review before you consider buying this. I'm buying an Xbox now and possibly a gamecube later. I've heard too many complaints from import owners of the GCN to be excited about the gamecube. If you're older than 12 then why would you settle for a GCN? As a 22 year old gamer Nintendo games for the most part stopped appealing to me around age 15. My policy on GCN is ""wait and see"" for now."
1714,2,"I bought this for my boyfriend, who takes Xbox gaming pretty seriously. I wad unhappy to realize that this keyboard is rather bulky when it's on the controller (not a feature most hardcore gamers would be happy to have). Also, in addition to being bulky on the controller I noticed myself that the device was hard to remove from the controller and I almost felt like I was going to either break my controller or break the keyboard. This item was only used a handful of times before going back in to it's box and forgotten about. Would not buy again."
1715,2,"This game may have more songs than its Japanese cousin but that does not mean it is better. It's completely neutered from the Japanese version instead it plays catch up with the Japanese versions. This would eventually set the stone to how American DDR versions play catch up to Japanese home versions. Yes, this version has 71 songs over the Japanese version's 44. The vast majority of the songs here HAVE ALREADY APPEARED in Japanese versions so we find this game complete and utterly useless. Yes, for every one unique licensed song this game has, there are about a dozen more found in Japanese versions."
1716,2,"Another game released that makes you wish Grand Theft Auto V for PC would release already.

That's all I got. Okay one more, The ultimate new exploitative weapon for First Person Shooters: the police badge. I could be the ultimate mercenary wearing all sorts of equipment meant for any possible fire fight, BUT OH MY GOD! IT'S THE #$%^ING COPS! I BETTER SURRENDER! ARREST ME COPPER! Come one guys, throw your weapons down, don't try to defend me, let the cops cuff you!

Multiplayer has flare.....yup. Car chases in a Battlefield game. wooo. But Wow, this looks just like Battlefield 4 except it's completely worse and dumbed down. So, in other words: if you are good at Call of Duty games but couldn't get into Battlefield, then this might be your game to kill time with until the inevitable future Call of Duty release.

This game needs to be called, Battlefield: Filler"

1718,2,"This mouse is too small.  I would stay away from the 13 series unless you are either

A. very young kid
b. have very small hands

I'm also not a fan of ambidextrous buttons.  The extra set on the right gets in your way too often."
1719,2,"I really wish I'd read the description before purchasing ""Petz Catz 2"" for Nintendo Wii. I thought it would be a simulation game, where you dressed up and took care of the cats. Instead it's full of annoying little games that aren't all that much fun. Wish I'd passed on this title."
1720,2,"Originally I skipped over buying this game because I saw a bad video review for it on youtube and opted instead to buy Left 4 Dead GOTY (which I am SO happy for as it turned out to be one of my favorite games ever) but after buying Left 4 Dead 2 where they added too many changes to the game thus screwing up the brilliant simplicity of the original, I was talked into buying Dead Island. And the reason why I originally avoided buying it proved true. Not only is the game too slow-paced too often, but you are constantly repairing your weapons or else they break and you lose them for good. Yeah, I know, breaking weapons sounds more realistic, BUT 1. it takes away from the fun when you have to repair a baseball bat after only 9 or 10 zombie hits, and 2. why would i have to repair a crowbar or solid steel pipe or anything else that obviously can withstand a lot of real-world damage, and 3. why in the HELL do i have to repair a crowbar as often as i have to repair a wooden stick??? Yes, the durability of the weapons in this game is that screwed up.

The Hit Detection is horrible in this game (Zombies can magically hit you while having the same reach as you and yet you can't hit them unless you move closer), and the Aiming of the crosshairs in this game is spazmatic. Literally. You move the crosshairs to aim your next attack and it wobbles around the screen like someone having a seizure is controlling the analog stick.

What's REALLY stupid is that in this game you have to go around collecting money to not just buy things like weapons (which is a given) but you have to pay to repair and upgrade and modify your weapons. Sounds like something inconsequential to gripe about, right? Well you repair/upgrape/modify your weapons by collecting things around the island and then you find a workbench and your character chooses from the free things you have gathered and for some reason then have to pay to use them. Umm, if i collect a roll of duct tape and a knife and want to 'modify' my baseball bat at a workbench by taping the knife to the end of my bat, WHY do i have to PAY to tape that knife to my bat when I'M the one doing it and it's MY stuff that I collected??? It makes NO sense, but obviously then needed to institute some sort of system. It's just a crappy, unnecessary system.

The game looks good, but even the nice graphics cannot stop the boredom from creeping in. There's a LOT of walking (or driving, but i'll get to that in a minute) around, then you see a zombie or 2 and kill it, then a lot more walking around. Basically nearly EVERY mission is a ""Fetch"" quest where someone needs this item so you go from point A to point B, get the item, then return back to point A where you learn you need to get another item, so you then leave point A and go to point C, get the next item only to return to point A again where now at point D theres another item you need to fetch. Basically that's the missions of this game. And THAT would be fun IF there were a lot more roaming zombies and a lot better fighting/hit detection system in place.

Something i REALLY hate is because the weapon system is crap you find yourself using the melee attack button often, the only problem is there are only 2 preset controls and neither have the melee attack assigned to a more ""convenient"" button. One is the default with it assigned to the L Bumper, and the other changes it, but ALSO changes the controls into some weight ""analog"" fighting control scheme I've never seen in any game before that's just awkward and confusing.

And now the driving. yes, you can drive, and if you DO play this game remember to get the truck fixed ASAP as if you wait you will be doing a LOT of boring walking around. BUT driving is almost as annoying as walking because the viewpoint from inside the truck is so awkward you are constantly driving into things and getting stuck because it looks like you'll clear by it but you don't.

The island IS big, which is cool, and the zombies seem to randomly respawn so it's not like you clear an area and then its forever rid of zombies, BUT with the little amount of zombies sprinkled around the island AGAIN you will find yourself getting bored every few minutes before a short action burts, then back to the boring traveling again.

I LOVE Zombie games, and it's hard for me not to like Dead Island as i really tried, but there's just too much wrong with it -even with the free dlc the GOTY comes with- to recommend it for anything more than a weekend rental. TAKE MY ADVICE: if you're looking for a fun zombie game, BUY LEFT 4 DEAD GOTY. It's literally one of the best games I've ever played, one of the funnest, and it beats Dead Island HANDS DOWN in every category.

Also, this GOTY version has a new character and stuff but the game only comes with the original game booklet which doesn't say anything at all about him or his skills or specialties or anything. You'd think they'd at least update and put in a newer instruction booklet.

I give this game 2 stars. Fighting the zombies is just too annoying because of the shoddy hit detection and the annoying spazzy crosshairs, having to repair your weapons CONSTANTLY (at least until further in the game when you can PURCHASE upgrades) is just plain annoying, and there's just too much wandering around where nothing much of anything happens while you're on one of the too-many ""Go Fetch This-Or-That Item"" quests. Maybe I've given it an unfair lower rating because I can't help but compare it to Left 4 Dead, but that only confirms my advice to DEFINITELY buy LEFT 4 DEAD over this game any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.

And REMEMBER: I recommend the ORIGINAL Left 4 Dead Game of the Year edition, NOT Left 4 Dead 2. Although the second one is fun, the original is MUCH better. The second one added in a melee system so you can use bats and axes and whatnot (and funny enough their melee system is WORLDS BETTER than that of Dead Island, too) but they also added in a wider variety of special-type zombies, and the types they added are just annoying to the point that you wish they would have kept everything the same as the original but just made the second one a bunch of more levels.

Anyways, there you go and i hope this helps. Just don't blame me if you don't heed my advice =-)"
1721,2,"UPDATE (4/28/18): Razer emailed me to tell me that they just discovered that this is not compatible with iOS. So at this time, if you have a Mac do not buy this.

The Razer Mamba HyperFlux and Firefly bundle is a pretty incredible piece of engineering, an extremely light and sensitive mouse that is wirelessly powered from the mousepad it sits on. Like so many of Razer's products there is a colorful glow emanating from the devices that I think is really cool (and drives my wife nuts). If the device worked as advertised it would be a 5-star for sure. The mouse is extremely light because it doesn't need to have the battery onboard to work wirelessly. And it is incredibly responsive and sensitive to even slight movements; I can't discern any lag between moving my hand and the on-screen movement. This makes it optimal not only for gaming but also for productivity. So it could function as an all-purpose mouse, not just gaming.

The mouse has multiple configurable buttons, and the colors are advertised as configurable as well. However, after an hour+ and multiple install-uninstall efforts, all with the guidance of customer support I could not get the Razer software to recognize the device at all on my Mac. Based on my interaction in the Razer forum, Mac is just not well supported, usually involving a lot of bugs and a long delay in supporting any operating system upgrade. This is advertised as being Mac compatible, and the mouse does work immediately upon plugging it in, but the only thing that works is the movement and the standard two mouse buttons."
1722,2,"this collection of games were okay, the best one out of them all was super packman. the rest were not worth playing. :("
1723,2,I bought this to play while overseas. I dod not know that an internet connection was required for single player play! BOOO! Shame on you blizzard! Such a great game destroyed by the inability to play when I wanted it!
1724,2,"I saw this game being played and had to try it myself.  I must say the first couple levels were really great but then it went downhill really fast.  Most all the stages are remakes of original Sonic levels and are nearly spot on.  If you enjoy the original Sonic you'll love the beginning.  Honestly the following 3D stages were pretty good.  Controls seemed to be nearly as good as the original Sonic Adventure 1 & 2.  However, once you complete the stages and must perform ""challenges"" that's when everything comes crashing down...

Many stages aren't laid out well so you find yourself running into obsticals or flying off cliffs.  I think what really got me was the doppelganger race.  I hit a sport where I couldn't leap over so I figure I'd wait for the other sonic to come and see what route he takes.  He runs beside me, hangs out at the wall for a second then runs back, grabs some imaginary lift then shoots over the wall...  And then the first boss battle.  The 2D portion is fine, but once it hits 3D, it becomes nearly impossible

I'm hoping someone will post a completed save game at some point...  The graphics and everything are really good in the game and would love to see some re-made levels.  I just find it too frustrating to get there myself..."
1725,2,"Sim City 3K Unlimited is definately a great game, but it doesn't work correctly on many systems.

1726,2,"-----------------------------------------------------------
Update 9/12/2012:

The keys have started repeating. At first I thought it was just me hitting certain letters twice, but it keeps happening and I see another reviewer is having the same problem. Also, because the corded cable is so heavy, it causes some wear on the ports they're plugged into. In the end, this keyboard (and the Xai mouse) was not at all worth it and I don't think I'll be getting another SteelSeries product.

-----------------------------------------------------------

After excitedly getting the 7g in I noticed that behind the clear plastic of the box the keyboard was missing the END key. After opening the box up and taking everything out I did end up finding it and I put it back on. So far it seems secure in its place. Hopefully no other keys find their way off of the keyboard. I also couldn't find the armrest that came with it. It was sitting right in front of me and I looked right at it. I found that funny after I did find it though. It must have been the black (matte?) finish against my TV stand of the same color. The armrest is great though. Maybe a little long, but it stays in place and doesn't move around which I wasn't expecting from reading a review of a guy saying it felt a little loose.

I find the 2 USB ports and the headphones jacks completely useless. I use a USB headset that would require USB 2.0 and the ports on the keyboard are 1.1. What the keyboard could really use is a led backlight. Maybe they really wanted to be unique by being so basic, but when your gaming in the dark you need to at least see the outline of the keys some times. That being said, I can see the nice and large white keys on the black background surprisingly well with just the light from my monitor. Speaking of light, the 3 led lights for Num lock, caps lock, and Scroll lock are extremely bright. I never understood why companies think having a bright leds all in your face while you should be concentrating on the monitor was a good idea. If it distracts me too much I might put a piece of electrical tape or something over them (My fix for bright leds).

I liked the fact that they replaced the left windows key with their own steelseries logo that functions as a media key. They could have just opted for a kill switch ala Logitech's G series of keyboards (That I have and use). The best thing about this keyboard though is the feel of the typing. It feels so good to me that it is worth looking over all the little issues I'm having with it. The short delete key and the extra large enter key was a big design mistake in my opinion. I've come across this keyboard design before and never really liked it. But alas, my fingers are already used to it and  I'm not hitting the \ key anymore.

Overall I find this keyboard a nice change from all the fancy macro keyboards I've been trying out lately. The feel to me is what sets it up on the pedestal. Oh yeah and the fact that it is so heavy is great. I have a big problem with keyboards sliding around on me due to lame placement of rubber stoppers and light weight (Logitech G19,13 for example) and let me tell you, for me anyways, this keyboard doesn't move after you set it were you want it.

To Summarize, it is a great product but a little pricey for the lack of features. It could have used a backlight but the weight of the keyboard and the tactile response you get from the keys are what make this keyboard great."
1727,2,"This headset is better than the one the comes from Microsoft but its still not great.

It does what it is supposed to do. I can talk through it on xbox live and hear others.

The main problem is that these headsets are not made to last. This one snapped after a few months. I tried to tape it up but it was uncomfortable.

Get some turtle beach headsets. They are quality, last a long time, and are worth it for games like COD. I am glad I did because I kept wasting money on the cheap plastic ones."
1728,2,"Buy Titan Quest and install the Diablo II Immortal MOD, below is how to accomplish this.
Hear ye, hear ye, this is Diablo II with a graphics update or Diablo III as it should have been...maybe. The point is, if you loved Diablo II and you just want better graphics, then just play this game with the Diablo II character classes. Let me tell to what to do and don't worry it is completely legal so don't worry. Unlike Blizzard's games where any modification will land you in the pen this game encourages modding and has some great ones. The one you'll care the most about though, like me, is called Diablo 2 Immortal. Go to titanquest(dot)net a very friendly very legal website and look under their modding tab and find the D2 Immortal mod and download it. It should be fairly simple to install, but should you run into any issues leave me a note and I'll gladly help you out. Believe me, I want people to find this and enjoy it like I have. I had been dying to play my Skeleton raising Necromancer and my Hammerdin from Dibalo 2 but I lost my D2 expansion disk and didn't want to drop $20 again on D2 and plus I'm furious at Blizzard for the abomination that they released and insultingly called it Diablo III. Seriously, all you need is this game and the Diablo 2 Immortal Mod and you are set for a good long while. While on titanquest(dot)net log in and drop them a huge thank you, lots of work goes into what they do."
1729,2,"the item should be new and sealed but the DVD wasn't int it's place and had some scratches on it.  otherwise, the price was the best $19.99
i would give it 2 start due to the # of missions there are only 8 missions which are from my point of view are few."
1730,2,"I'll start by saying this controller looks and feels very nice great texture and small and lightweight also probably it's best feature the buttons light up when you pick up the remote or turn it slightly so it's nice in the dark. Now for the bad, because of the light up feature the remote burns through batteries fast . I feel that they should have made it chargeable seriously how hard would that be. I have a rechargeable battery for my xbox one controller and I love it I bought this remote so I wouldn't have to use my controller when watching movies and netflix but now since It eats up batteries it's just collecting dust and I'm back to my controller. also there are no number buttons on it witch would have been awesome because then it could replace your cable remote. oh well 2"
1731,2,"To start, just let me say that I was really looking forward to this game.  Been with the franchise since the original Medieval, so it holds a special place in my heart.  Like others, Rome 1 was my favorite, so a sequel was going to be amazing in my mind.

Unfortunately this isn't the case.  This game just has too many issues that keep me from enjoying it, both in the campaign map and battle phases.  To start with, I fear Rome 2 may have tried a little too hard to be like Civ V, and many of the same issues raise their heads this time around.  Population happiness will make you want to rip your hair out as it rises and plummets for no particular reason.  City management is very restricted yet complicated at the same time.  The technology tree strives to be that of Civ V and falls very short.  I wish TW had realized the majority of people do not buy these games for the city management aspect--they buy them for the epic battles!  Which leads to the next wave of issues...

Like many other reviews have mentioned, this game's battles basically turn into large blob vs. large blob.  If your blob is stronger, congrats you win.  If you want to win every battle, get a blob of equal size to the enemy, charge their blob with yours, and flank with 1 cavalry unit.  There is no room for tactics or micro-management of units...just blobs smashing against each other.  Even if there was room for the previously mentioned, it would still not be that great because the AI has not improved.  It's not really the developers' fault, as AI can only go so far.  They will occasionally try to flank you, but that's about it.  Same old, same old.

Finally, this might just be me, but I think they tried a bit too hard with the campaign map.  It's huge, which is sweet, but it's super-crowded.  There's 100+ factions this time around, which looks cool at first...until you realize that large groups of them are basically the same faction with a different name.  Since they are so numerous, many of the actual playable factions are forced to start with 1, 2, or 3(if you're lucky) provinces.  In my campaign as the Britons, roughly half of the playable factions were wiped out by ""minor"" factions in the first 40 turns or so.

This game has potential...it really does.  When the mods come out it will be great.  Until then, it just feels half-baked and over-complicated."
1732,2,Glitchy on the pc don't get it for that.
1733,2,What a terrible game. The whole point of this game is to loot stores and cause chaos without getting caught or killed. There seemed to be a lot of hype surrounding this game because of its violent nature but that died down when people realized that it was boring. There's only so many times you want to do the same thing over and over. Don't bother with this game.
1734,2,"Ok, so I'm adding nothing new here, but I feel pretty strongly about the game.  I enjoyed about half of the levels.  The levels that were enjoyed were those where you need to pick your spots and shoot the bad guys.  This doesn't mean camping out and sniping - that usually won't happen because the bad guys are quite aggressive in their storming your position - but also because the designers like to create spawn points that are almost always in a place that is right on top of any spot.  So, for some of the levels, you are basically shooting one wave only to be taken over by the next wave, dying, and figuring out what the ""signal"" for the next spawn is so you can move - and their spawning points are usually ridiculously unrealistic.  That's the main problem - they attempt at realism in various scenarios removes most of the fun from the game.

Moving is co-number one issue with this game.  Yeah, the visuals are pretty and there is a lot to see. If - big IF - if you only had time to actually stop and look at the scenery, the buildings crashing down, etc.  To stay in one spot in this game too long is to die, even if you think you are perfectly hidden.  They always seemt to know where you are.

So, you gotta move.  And moving is dangerous.  Why?

Because the game mechanics of close-up combat are ridiculously awful.  So awful that it ruins everything.  There are a lot of complaints about the controls.  I don't think its the controls as much as the mechanics implemented to be, assumingly, more realistic.  And if that's not the case, then yeah - the controls suck.  But the mechanics are awful, and awfully inconsistent, and the AI is such that in tandem with the controls and/or mechanics, if a dude is anywhere within the range of your shotgun, you have a more-than-good chance of death.

The accuracy of shooting is seemingly completely random as well, as is the effect of the shot on the enemy.  I can't tell you how many dudes survive what looked like head-shots of the shotgun up-close (especially the flamethrowers).

And when you do hit them, except for the random headshot (I finally figured it was totally random and had nothing to do with aim)they will howl in pain or lie down, stand there in a daze, BUT THEY ALMOST SEEM INVINCIBLE when they are writhing in agony (usually just long enough for your reload to finish and you to fire off a shot that's perfectly late)"
1735,2,I'm sure 99% of the people that buy this game purchase it for the online game play. This game has a very broken online. Maybe for PC is better but on console there's too many glitches and sync issues to steadily play this game. You're either good or bad depending on how your connection is applied by DICE's servers. Most foreign players have the advantage because DICE throws them a curve for having weaker connections meaning that you'll be 3-4 seconds behind them so what you see foreign players doing on your screen in the game is actually on a delay. Foreign players know this and they play the advantage by invade as many U.S. Servers in the game as they can and it make the game incredibly broken. It's gotten to the point where people that host game servers to play on will put what countries they exclude or USA only. Aside from those crippling issues with online game play it can be fun depending on who you're playing with or not but mostly it's a frustrating experience online.
1736,2,"Hugely disappointing game

I cannot find much positives about this game, the only thing that is good is the world design.

The character design and animations are horrible

dialogue is laughable

gameplay is boring and tedious, poor mission design

shooting is just ok.

I'm not even 2 hours in and i'm finding it very difficult to find a reason to continue playing"
1737,2,"I bought these thinking they would be compatible with gamecube controllers, but they are too big"
1738,2,"I remembered playing Shinobi (the original arcade version) when I was a kid and it was the first game I ever beat. That was a great feeling and I'll never forget that. I was really looking foward to this and I bought it the first day it came out. All the other reviews are correct, after level 2 it got repeative (even the graphics)and really difficult. If anyone decides to play this I recommend gameshark codes, you'll need them. I like challenges but this was more frustrating than a challenge. I was very dissapointed with this, they could've done so much better. This game I wished I waited till the price went down, definately not worth the $50, but I went ahead and bought it anyways; bad mistake on my part. Some will like this and some will not."
1739,2,"We all love mega man.  I got this for the games and the gold amiibo.  The amiibo comes in a clear and unmarked package that is much larger than the normal amiibo boxes.  Clear and unmarked!?  I already had the normal mega man amiibo this one was just as a collector item to display, it should have come in a box with the regular drawings/designs.  Kind of disappointed seems like a lazy cash grab with minimal effort put into it."
1740,2,"After several months, the tracking and mouse buttons still work fine, but the scroll wheel has become very faulty. For example, if I'm scrolling down in a document, it will begin to scroll down, only to jump back up a little at the last second. This isn't as pronounced scrolling up, but happens occasionally. Games that rely on the scroll wheel are entirely unplayable now. I'm assuming this is due to dirt and grime getting in the wheel, but the only way to open the mouse is by tearing apart the serial number at the bottom, and I don't want to do that. I expected to get more use for $70."
1741,2,Got this game because I love hidden object games. This one is more of a card game than a hidden object game. The second game on the disc is more to my liking.
1742,2,"I think the biggest flaw of the game is that they focused far too much on the Batmobile and not enough on the open world. Everything you do in-game revolves around your vehicle, So much so that you will spend roughly 65% of the campaign inside of it. They have pretty much stripped the open world/exploring part of this game and replaced it with a vehicle that suffers from poor controls and just doesn't look that good.

Then again, The whole game doesn't look that good either. It's a painfully dark and poor mess that just fails to impress like previous Arkham games. The scarecrow is the main villain and he's just sort of eh. The Arkham Knight was a great potential villain that is teased through out the whole game as Batman's equal with some obvious past history between him and the dark knight. In the end, You don't even fight. The boss battle is all about stealth and it's just an awful disappointment considering how much potential he had as a villain.

And then we move onto similar issues with what Arkham City had. They try to cram in a lot of popular villains and it just doesn't really work. I loved what they did with Man-Bat and Firefly, That showed potential. I think they'd be better off focusing on 3 villains and giving them a story arc that spans several missions instead of trying to cram 5-7 villains into several short and boring missions. And least we forget all the lovely bugs and glitches that the game still suffers from despite several patches, That's disappointing as well.

Overall, I enjoyed AK for the most part, Certainly more so than Arkham Origins. I just don't think the potential was fully used. They don't make use of the graphics despite being the first Arkham game on a next gen system. They also focus far too much on the Batmobile instead of crafting the open world that we are so use to playing and exploring. It just leads to a lot of lack luster and boring game play. I wouldn't say I'd recommend it but if you can get it for cheap (under 15 bucks) then I'd say give it a shot."
1743,2,"This game is a media darling, but I couldn't help but feel like the gameplay and the graphics were old and outdated. The game seemed like something I would play on a PC in the mid 1990s. I know it's a remake of an older game, but I would have liked to have seen some more modern gameplay elements."
1744,2,"Man I don't know what Square Enix was thinking when they made this game. I played most of the Final Fantasy series, even the MMO's. When I played FFXIII (part 1) I loved it. It was a bit linear but in chapter 11 you got to the open area and it was pretty cool. After everyone complained about that, they did FFXIII (2). The time travel thing was cool, it was very open (I guess from all the complains about the first being very linear), but it was missing Lighting.

I was pretty excited when they announced this, I downloaded the demo and did the preorder. When I got it and played it for real, I only replayed that first stage that they gave us with the demo and stopped there. I hated it, and haven't played it again after that day.

I loved the battle system from the first one, it was simple. This one was old school Final Fantasy mixed with what you would normally have to worry about in the MMOs... builds. And it over-complicated everything. The point of this game is supposed to be something more casual and they tried to put MMO elements into it and they took out the fun from it.

I still hope to find the heart to play it some day and hopefully change my mind and I'll come back and edit this review."
1745,2,"I highly suggest that you do not buy this game. The first level is far out cool, but the rest of the entire game is you, a lonesome soldier against hundreds of Germans. The weapons are not cool, the game is too easy, and the storyline does not follow World War 2 at all. The graphics, are...eeh... okay, but could be much better. I had this game for about a week, and already I got bored. Plus, I beat the game in three days, flat, so that kinda tells you that it's a [bad] game. And the controls! JEEZ LAWEEZE!... They're impossible!
The aiming system is terrible, and the guns are completely inacurate. Don't buy this game."
1746,2,"Pros:
- Fancy Matrix-style moves.
- The game is severely discounted.
- Voice talent is from the TV series.
- Frequent save games.
- Simple controls to pull off a variety of moves.
Cons:
- Very very repetitive.
- Uninteresting storyline between sequences.
- Pulling off the fancy moves doesn't really get you much new.
- AI is poor. Far too easy to stealtily take down the enemy.
- Game world is far too constraining. There is far too little to do.
- When fighting the boss you lose the ability to use your weapons and health packs."
1747,2,"Eh, this game is okay, but not worth the hype.  As many other reviews will tell you, great idea and story, just not much action or different outcomes based on your playing style; not the best follow-up to Red Dead.

Since it's one-player, I watched my son play for a few hours last night and cannot see a reason I will need to play this game (less achievements, gamer-points?).  Unlike Red Dead, there are not multiple ways to get to same outcome; it is very routine.

I could repeat other reviews about the handicaps; single player, no on-line, endless ammo, repeated missions, same outcome, etc.  The real downfall is simply no replay value--really no replay value if you have as much as watched somebody play it.

Great for rental or borrowing from a friend, but I could hardly see buying with intent to keep (In contrast, I played Red Dead just last week)...I would really discourage buying at full price (like I did). :)  Hope this helps..."
1748,2,"I LOVE Sega.

I wanted to love this game. It has flaws. It is still a good game, but it's not what the fans wanted. It needs more. It needs a special edition with the battle system revamped. It needs online. It needs new practicality.

Don't be mad at Sega, they tried something new and it did not go over.

Sega, please still release the great games you always have! Please give us a new and revamped version of Golden Axe.

The graphics are great, and the boss battles are FUN! Especially Death Adder at the end of the game. There are so many great things about Golden Axe that it sucks that they messed it up.

The battle system is only half done. Broken (although not terribly broken) is the word for it.

Riding the beasts is fun, and they are powerful, and add a whole new dimension to the battle. Develop this, Sega! It's a good idea! Just work harder on it!

I still recommend this game because SO much IS right with it.... but we still need to send the message that we will not accept things like this!!

Amazon's price is worth it, so pick it up today.... just know that Sega always rules, and I hope all the very best for Sega's continued success.

Bravo Sega!"
1749,2,"Folks, if you were going to purchase Primal to fill that adventure/exploration gap in your PS2 life, save your time and money.  While Primal did add some interesting twists on explorative/gothic gameplay, it still falls short of being a title worthy of hard earned cash.  Interesting and often beautiful environments are a plus here... but the figthing system is lame and repetitve, and the puzzles hardly merit mention.  There is no sense of addictive fun or excitement in Primal. - The stop and start brawls with easy-to-kill monsters gets old really fast.  This game is mostly comprised of clever cut-scenes and too much walking around. ..."
1750,2,"Before I wanted this, I expected this to be a fun, entertaining experience.  Instead, I got this: bad AI, boring gameplay, and only 8 playable characters.  I expected more out of Sonic Shuffle.

On paper, Sonic Shuffle is great:  picking out cards, moving to spaces, and getting the most Precious Stones.  In practice, it is the opposite.  This is a very boring game, and with the AI, they can be very hard to beat, even on the Easy difficulty setting.  The game's story is horrible:  A fairy named Lumina asks the Sonic team to help her get Precious Stones and save everyone's dreams from Void.  Yeah, it's a baby story.

The graphics are suprisingly good.

The sound is so bad.

This game doesn't live up to its full potential.  Add minigames that are either frustrating or confusing, and you've got one of the worst games ever made."
1751,2,"A new turn for a protaganist. Instead of the macho, gun-waving, all-knowing godlike anti-hero with a softside, you're Irish.
Graphics are not bad. Not amazing, but not gamebreaking.
The gameplay is sketchy. Kinda bugged at times. But not often.
Not a great game but worth a shot if you like the concept."
1752,2,"I was really hoping id like this game. It was fun for awhile but it becomes just irritating. I hate the camera. Its way too close. Sucks fighting in closed areas because half the time you cant see the enemy after you dodge an attack. My other big gripe i don't know why death can grab some ledges and some not? They should have designed it better but it sucks always having to try and try to climb or grab without knowing if he will. Then theres the jumping, he jumps like a grandma. Alot of stuff that he should easily be able to clear he cant?"
1753,2,"The game play for Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is very poor.  As others have said, there is no save option in this game, and the exit and loading screens are very confusing and unnecessary.  The camera panning is horrible. You have to move the mouse and the keys to control the character and it takes a lot of getting used to.  Although the sound and graphics is excellent, and I had some fun with the fighting, it's too much of a hassle to control the character.

I will echo what someone else said about the tram sequence being one of the most pointless in PC gaming history."
1754,2,"I bought this game because I was drunk.  It's the worst game I've ever played, but I admit I am not the intended audience.  I gave it 2 stars because SOME kids may enjoy it.  It has pretty shallow gameplay (jump, shoot/punch [same button], and interact), awful camera angles (expect to die many times while platforming), and hilariously holds your hand (90% of the way through, my sidekick was still reminding me that [circle] is the button to pick up a gun)."
1755,2,I got this in a wii bundle. Only game worth playing is tennis. I suggest wii sport resort of anything else

1758,2,"It's The Simpsons in a... skateboarding game? I thought it was pretty strange myself, but I guess it was brought onto the market because of how big The Simpsons are and how big skateboarding it. Sounds like a great match, of course, for me being a Simpsons fan and a skateboarding kid. Well it wasn't. The graphics were not good even for the cartoony look they had, the control was absolutely terrible, every trick wasn't fun to look at, the level design wasn't good, the lines characters say is repetetive, and there is just not a lot of characters to play as. I am a gigantic Simpsons fan, but that does not mean I like the video games. ( except Hit and Run and Road Rage. ) I definitely think you should pass this one up, everything about it is bad, which means NOTHING about it is GOOD."
1759,2,"I received the game in a timely manner, it came with everything promised, etc.

However, the game was junk at the time of release.  Despite the improvements now, it's not a true Star Trek game.  It's mostly combat and a cash shop.

Trekkies will have to continue waiting if they want a good Star Trek MMO."
1760,2,"This game reminds me of a bad low budget action b-movie. The graphics are digitized,so it gives the fighters somewhat of a real look to them,but good lord...this game sucks. You choose from three diffrent fighters. A wrestler,a karate guy and a kickboxer. You fight diffrent fighters,who look completly ridiculous,and have goofy names like CC Rider,who is this biker dude that you fight in a bar. You gotta keep winning fights to get your cash stack to get higher and higher. Yet there is ABSOLUTLEY nothing to do with it,once you've made it. This is a very bad fighting game. I can't think of ONE good thing about this. Its that bad. Only reason I gave it a two instead of a one,is because it sucks...but it's still worth a good laugh or two lol"
1761,2,"Worst purchase I've made in awhile.  I preordered this through Best Buy and received another Playmaker bundle with 5 MUT packs.  This was in addition to the Playmaker pack and 36 you get form Deluxe.  Opened 2 playmakers and 6 MUT packs on opening night and all I got was a handful of 50s, 60's and 2 Antonio Browns which seem to be the only Playmaker you get in these Playmaker packs.  Seriously... opened 2 playmakers and I get two identical 90 Antonio Browns.  The pack rewards are clearly fixed.

Gameplay- Slowed down considerably from Madden 15.  All players feel like they are walking their routes instead of running.  I don't have lag, just the tempo is very slow and feels clunky.

Defense is non-existent.  Offense can now throw a Hail Mary on 1st and 10 and with the new ""Y' button Aggressive catch, the receiver catches it 85% of the time.  Defense is always 2 steps behind the receiver, so every game I've played in, both myself and opponent finish with 95% completion rates.  Keep in mind this is with my Level 72 MUT team.

Overall- A complete waste of money.  I spent 69.99 compared to what I could have had with Amazon's pre order of the Standard edition for $45.00 just for a handful of scrubs and a fixed Playmaker Antonio Brown thats in all Playmaker packs."
1762,2,"I know the people who like the game will only except "" this is the best game ever perfect 10"" otherwise your a lair and a troll,..

Quite frankly this game is just OK. but very frustrating! Has its great moments, but misses the mark in my opinion.

What i do like about the game is the loading, or lack there of, very seamless and fast .. i wish more games where able to do this.

My main issue I have with it is, cut scenes not initiating and with no real save feature you might be stuck for good or have to restart your Xbox,,.. there are many doors, treasures, jewels , etc that you try to get that the game won't allow you to do or get, resulting in painfully trying to achieve something you can't do, or must do in a quest, or with a certain item, or at a certain time, but,,, you don't know that. Too much time spent having to fail to figure out why you can't do something, it's becomes a chore. Forced to go online to figure simple stuff out because THQ, thought it would be fun to waste huge amounts of time doing nothing.

I wish it had more puzzles and less time the puzzle being, that after an hour of trying to get a jewel you figure out you cant and weren't supposed to in the first place,,OR IF THE GAME IS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY..,, Sometimes quests don't kick in properly, initiate properly, this is a knowN issue and will likely get patched, but can burn you for a lot of wasted time and you won't know it. Comparing weapons is a chore, walking is a chore as you wish you could go faster. I wish the blood actually splattered on the walls and floor which would have been cool, but like I said the graphics aren't that great. (see game site videos)

One thing that might be a deal breaker for some. You can go into an arena, say with 5 health potions and use them fighting a boss, however, get to the next room get locked in with a boss and not be able to fight because you have no more health, and not be able to progress or leave because of the lack of a previous save feature. This can cause a game re-start with is truly annoying. (see forums)However, when you use health potions, the game does have a knack for dropping them in loot for you which is nice.

The game play is fun, the fighting / combat is enjoyable..if not a bit repetitive...The graphics are ok, but very old looking in my opinion. Probably why the loading is so fast.. I have about 30 hours into it and finally finished it. The second to last boss was very annoying to me,, and came off cheap, many people had to do it over 20 or 30 times..(See forums) This game is frustrating often and too much time spent painfully figure out if your even supposed to open the door or get the jewel in the first place. What they did is add a lot of time to the game this way..

If you look at the forums for it all you will see is,,,HELP!, STUCK!, STUCK!, SWITCH WONT WORK!, CANT CONTINUE!,,,SEE FOR YOURSELF.

I GIVE IT A 6.5."
1763,2,"It was just not, my cup of tea. Way to corriagraphed and linnier. I enjoyed Max Payne 1&2 for PS2. Those were also linnier but that was PS2. I expected more from Max Payne 3 but I was disapointed bigtime."
1764,2,Battlefield 4 is way better
1765,2,"The Daredevil movie was good, but this game has little to do with it (other than the picture on the box). Forget the storyline, or the repetitive gameplay, or the boss battles, and even the radar sense...where's the save function on here? There is none! That's right! Instead of being able to save your game, you have to write down the ""passcode"" they give you to get you back to your place in the game. Not since the wonderful days of the SNES have we resulted to such an idiotic method of saving games! And don't tell me the capability isn't there, because they have it in virtually every other GBA game out there. The sound effects are fine, the graphics are pretty good, and the response is ok. If you're just a huge fan of DD, grab a pen and paper to remember your save code and go for it. Not recommended."
1766,2,"I just bought this game recently and put several hours into it before deciding that it was not enough fun to continue playing.

The Good:

1. Graphics/Visuals (4/5)
This is really the strength of Tools of Destruction.  Even at 720p, this game looks very impressive.  No, it's not like an interactive Pixar movie, but you could see why people might compare this to playing in a Dreamworks Animation movie.  This game is just full of bright colored, smoothly animated objects/environments/characters, that it is really fun to just watch.  The cut scenes are well made as well, and give a cinematic feel to the game.  There are a lot of moving objects in the background, especially in the cities, that give a vibrant and more realistic feel to the environments.  Breaking boxes/containers is especially fun to watch (and hear).

2. Sound/Music (4/5)
The sound as well is excellent.  Great game music and sound effects that can really be appreciated if you have a decent 7.1 speaker system.  The sound of breaking/destroying objects/containers is great, and the effects when you pick up various objects/bonuses considerably add to the fun of this game.

Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.

The Mediocre:

1. Story/Acting (2.5/5)
Comparing this game to a generic animated film, like Ice Age or Happy Feet would be understandble, but to compare this game to a Pixar movie is just ridiculous.  You will not find Pixar quality writing in this game.  The characters are not interestingly designed and the writing is not very humorous or clever.  Kind of like any non-Pixar animation studio movie, which is not to say that it is horrible, just mediocre, as one would expect from a video game of this type.

The Not So Good:

1. Gameplay (2/5)
True, I did not finish the game, and only played through the first few levels before I packed it up and sold it on the most popular auction site.  However, the gameplay left me rather bored after awhile.  Initially, it was fun running around, hitting or shooting enemies, picking up objects, jumping up walls, and sliding on rails/tracks (which thankfully are not accompanied by visual cues of which buttons to press while sliding, as in Uncharted and Heavenly Sword).  But after awhile, it became extremely tedious and boring.  From the beginning, this game plays as an arcade game, with non-stop hack and slash action.  Not until you pass a couple of levels is there even a spot where you are not constantly fighting.  The fighting, also, gets tiresome quickly.  You can slash with your melee weapon or shoot a variety of guns/projectiles/etc.  But you'll find that it is far too easy to just use the same attack (slash attack when midair for a huge, circumferential attack) to kill all enemies in the first few stages.

2. Linearity (1/5)
This is a gameplay issue as well, but deserves its own section because it is so extremely linear that it significantly and negatively affects gameplay.  This game basically is running/jumping/gliding from point A to point B and so on.  You do not get a sense that this is a real world, but rather just a series of hiking trails in a variety of environments.  This makes it easy to navigate yet extremely boring.  Between the linear stages are cut scenes, that while nice, give you the feeling that you are watching an interactive movie where you can control the characters but that ultimately everything is following a pre-written script.  There is zero free exploration in this game, essentially it is as open-ended a world as you would find in a classic 80s side-scrolling game.

3. Lack of anything to do but hack n' slash (1/5)
Also a gameplay issue, but there is nothing to do in this game but continuously hack n' slash.  No exploration, no real puzzle solving (at least in the first few levels), no figuring out what to do next.  Just following the pre-scripted levels one tedious level after the next.

The Bottom Line:

Basically, this game has great presentation and production values, but the gameplay just flat out sucks.  So boring unless you are the type of gamer who enjoys linear gameplay with mindless hacking and slashing.  I would not recommend this game to anyone I know except as a demo to demonstrate the visual/audio capabilities of the PS3.

Overall rating is a 2/5 stars, because the excellent presentation does not compensate for the extreme linearity and tedious nature of this game, which in the end, should be fun, not just fun to look at and listen to."
1767,2,"I am an adult who has owned my Nintendo DS for 2 years. I enjoy puzzle games, hidden object and match3 games. My husband bought me several games for Christmas, one of them was ""Fabulous Finds."" I finished the first games and then reached the ""pipe"" minigames. I don't really like this type of games and have tried over and over and over the last month to no avail. You can only take the bottom pipe one at time and you might need one of the pipes in the middle of the stack. Also the amount of time you are given is ridiculous. Usually, in other games of this sort when it realizes that you are not ""getting it,"" it will offer to let to let you ""skip"" the one game and you forfeit a couple of minutes of the time you have to complete that level.

Yesterday, I called the tech department of THQ (company that makes ""Fabulous Finds) hoping that there would be some kind of code that could be entered to let me skip the pipe game. Needless to say, I was informed by the ""tech specialist"" (yeah right) that I was on my own to figure out the puzzle. I told him that we paid $20.00 for a game that has a level that I cannot do and cannot continue the game because of that....meaning this game is now useless to me, to which he replied ""That's Right."" He never offered to do anything for me (the customer USED to be right) and I cannot return this game to where we bought it, because it was opened. I did advise him that I would write a review so that others like me won't get stuck with a useless game and I would, in the future think twice before buying another game title from THQ!!!"
1768,2,"Starcraft II has been a long time coming, and I don't mean its comically long development cycle.  Rather, it is the long-feared bastard child of a lengthy line of increasingly invasive and repugnant designer control devices gussied up as ""anti-piracy"" conventions.

Gather 'round, wee bairns, and I'll tell you a tale.  Once upon a time, when if you bought a video game, you actually owned it.  In this crazy bizarro world, ownership of the game cartridge or floppy disk actually enabled you to simply play it whenever, wherever, and however often you wanted.  It was yours, like the books on your shelf or the 'shine in your still.

But then the designers grew wroth.  Somewhere, they assumed, someone might not be paying for their game.  And so they, in their infinite wisdom, decided they could take steps that -- although mildly intrusive -- might cut down on some of the imaginary money diverting away from their coffers.  So they invented things like CD keys and watchdog programs and hidden rootkits and ""phone home"" programs that would secretly report your nefarious doings back to the mothership whenever you foolishly logged your computer onto the Internet or wandered into a WiFi area.  Each ""anti-piracy"" development was a little more aggressive, a little more probing and invasive, than the last.  But for many gamers, as long as they got the particular game they wanted, all was well.  After all, the developers had to come to their senses eventually, right?  It's not like in their eyes, all gamers are guilty until proven innocent or anything.  ...Right?

Then, one fateful evening in the early 21st century, an overworked developer accidentally crossed the streams of his Mountain Dew and Red Bull and had an epiphany:  we don't even need to sell the games at all!  We can sell ACCESS to the games, which we keep safely locked up here on Planet Jackass.  And lo:  Steam was born, requiring you to download and play nice with an entire suite of malicious nannybot programs if you even wanted a fighting chance of playing the games you supposedly purchased when you obtained Valve's ""Orange Box""/Steam download kit.  Quietly, privately, we all died a little bit more inside.

Starcraft II is the next evolutionary step in this process.  You do not actually own Starcraft II.  You do not even own the present 1/3 of Starcraft II that has been opened for public viewing.  Rather, you own -- temporarily and subject to unappealable veto -- access to Starcraft II provided you maintain a live internet connection, invasive BattleNet account under your actual name, and inherently agree to chisel off any of your former expectations of playing with any of your friends in LAN games or spawning games to host with others.  No, instead you must each buy a Starcraft II ""game""/access kit, stay connected to BattleNet, and pray that Blizzard decides to not alter the deal any further.  If you're very, very good, maybe you'll get to buy the Zergs or Protoss someday for another $50+ a shot.

Something has to give.  Do we really want to pay another $30 just to be able to use the Barbarian class in Diablo III, or subscribe to a $15/month recurring fee just to be able to use flying units in Starcraft III?  How many pay gates will we permit developers to place between us and a full, unfettered copy of the entire game that we supposedly purchased in the first place?  Someday developers may realize the basic economic point that selling 10 million copies of a full game is more profitable than selling 500,000 copies of a spyware program masquerading as a space odyssey while simultaneously enraging their own customer base.  We can help that happen by not buying into the latter in the first place."
1769,2,"Don't get me wrong Smash Bros fans, this game is fun while playing against other people, and addictive. However, I do feel the game does get old after awhile like all Fighting games. The game can also be annoying at times while your characters become small to compensate for something going on in the background. And god help you during some of the stages when there is so much chaos going on you lose track of your character let alone what the heck is going on. Maybe that's the whole point or maybe I'm just getting old."
1770,2,"I regret buying it. I bought the G29 with this.

I love the G29... This, this sits on my bookshelf. The few times I used it I just wanted to throw it away. It feels fine and functions similarly (eh... ) to the real thing. But when in game (Project Cars) I was having a nightmare shifting to the right gear. I just gave up and used the paddle shifters. Which... makes me wonder why I bought it

Should you get this? Hmmm... maybe, hoping the next GT game for the PS4 supports the G29 properly....

There isn't that many games that use it. So make sure to check if your game supports it (and on what platform)"
1771,2,"It's a great game, but buying it by disc and installing it can be very problematic or impossible on pc's. I don't really recommend buying this game by cd."
1772,2,this video game is kinda lame you have to use a flash light to kill these demon like things that try to come after you at night.
1773,2,"Like it says in the subject. The way the game saves it progress makes me just want to scream, in fact, I have actually.

The game has predetermined checkpoints in each mission and does not let you save whenever you please. I find this very frustrating for several reasons.

1. I like to experiment with different infiltration styles, non and lethal kills. ect. ect. Can't now without starting all over.

2. The ""Predetermined checkpoints"" are few and far between a lot of missions. Some are okay where they save your progress often, but sometimes especially side missions there are few if not ANY checkpoints. Side missions where when you are detected the mission is scrubbed have lasers, tons of guards, dogs, cameras you know the works trying to detect you and will immediate fail the mission if any of the above succeed. Which makes you start all over from the very beginning. Some side missions, if your trying to do it using 100% no kills stealthy style, can take a very long time and to have all that effort wasted because one little laser touches your toe is SO FRUSTRATING!

3. I feel like my arm is being twisted by Ubisoft. I'm actually enjoying this game, barely, but it is not worth what they want right now. I mean how hard is it to give people options? Every game I play has automatic save features with a nice whenever you want to too!

I'm playing a level right now on normal difficulty but I just cant get it done. This mission has several main objectives, on an island, full of S@$t trying to detect me, and even when I'm nearing competition something goes wrong and I have to start all over

I'm actually going to recommend to most of my friends to not buy this game. They probably won't listen because Splinter Cell before conviction was awesome, but they can become even more frustrated with UBI as I have become.

This is my only main gripe about it, but I dislike it so much I feel I have to rate it one star. The game also has occasional CTD's but nothing too major. Other than that its decent. Just please let UBI know that we (if you feel as I) do not appreciate the lack of options to play the game how we wish to play.

Night

EDIT: I'm now getting constant CTDs. Ubi's quality control is in the toilet apparently but from what I've read from online forums that seems to have happened awhile ago. I'm tech savvy enough to have most likely ruled out my computer being the cause. Hardware/Software diagnostics whatnot, seems that the game is the cause. Hopefully patches will be released soon.

EDIT: Alright haha the game grew on me. Just got to get some skills going as far as the game mechanics is concerned otherwise its frustrating city. I don't feel the game explained the controls to me very well and I had to discover some basic moves on my own. Once I got the hang of it avoiding enemies, dashing pass lasers became easier, not easy, but easier. So the game got a lot less frustrating and a lot more fun. Still have tons of CTD's, playing the game to have it randomly crash either at the end of a mission, co-op... or the main menu, is the most frustrating thing I think I have to complain about, if they fix it I'll bump up the stars again. The whole save issue became much less of a problem when you finally get the hang of a game. Still would have liked it for reason number 1 though."
1774,2,i bought this memory card yesterday. i took it home and popped it in.it did not work it was broken. took it back and got another one and it was broken.so i got the sony one and it works fine. i mean don't get me wrong the shipment could have been knocked around but 2 out of 2 broken???? my friend has one and a sony one. it seems that the sony one loads twice as fast as this one and its easier to get out of the playstation. this one is a little tight in the console. so just because its 5 dollars less don't think it is just as good. if you ask me i would spend the extra five bucks and get a memory card that will work when you need it to.thanx alot and happy gameing outhere.
1775,2,my son had a hard time figuring how to start the game. you need to make more simpler for children to understand how to play it.
1776,2,"While I still contend that the 2k series is better than the Live series at being a more accurate, fun and realistic approach to basketball, I was really  disappointed with this years go around. Not because it's a bad game by any means, but because it's nearly exactly like 2k6 in terms of the play. Whereas the xbox 360 version features new player movements, animations, etc. this one is just last years version with new rosters. If you own a 360, definitely spend the $60 to get that version, but if you're like me and stuck with the old xbox and already own 2k6 then this isn't worth your time. However, if you don't own any basketball games and are wondering between this and Live, 2k7 is where your money should go. I guess last year's version pushed everything it could out of the xbox, so there's not much more they could've done. Maybe that's why this game was $30."
1777,2,"I won't add to the other reviews on game play, but I would like to mention that in multiplayer mode the object of the game is always to hit or hurt your opponent to win. Yes it is very mild violence such as hitting them, knocking them down or throwing things at them. However, we don't approve of physical violence of any kind or games that portray it, so this one is getting sold on Ebay."

And what matters it that the kids like it and can play it...and they cant, they've only played like 3 times and we've had it for a few months now."
1780,2,"I thought this would be the perfect mouse.  I figured after browsing the web a bit, reading the news and paying some bills online, I could flip it over and get down with an impromptu gaming session.  When I opened the package, I was impressed by the slick styling and texture of the mouse.  The battery cover feels fragile and sounds like it's going to snap into pieces when removed, but after several removals to store the USB receiver, it still seems fine. I tried the mouse on a 64-bit Windows 7 system first.  Five minutes into using this in mouse mode, I couldn't take it anymore and removed it from the system.  Mouse clicks failed to register, the mouse pointer was scattershot and it was just a plain horrible experience.  I didn't even try any other modes initially because if it can't work as a capable mouse on my 64-bit system, everything else is moot.  However, I did come back later and test the gamepad in 64-bit.  So, in fairness, I figured I'd try again on 32-bit Win 7 system.  On the 32-bit system, the mouse worked fine.  The mouse was just as capable as the wireless mouse normally used on that PC. I decided to try the different modes so I referred to the manual.  This thing must have been written by people with 20-10 eyesight because it has the smallest font I've ever seen in a printed manual.  I'm not exaggerating; I literally used a magnifying glass to read it.

After determining which buttons to press to switch modes, I tried remote control mode first.  Well, the mouse works okay on 32-bit, which is a good thing because the remote sure doesn't.  After successfully switching to remote mode, I tried volume, play, forward, reverse.  Nothing, nada, zilch.  No songs launched, no volume adjusted... nothing happened at all.  I mashed away at buttons in futility and Just when I was ready to give up hope, I pressed the ""power"" button (the one on the bottom that is part of the remote control, not the one on the side, which controls the main power), Well, that one button worked because it turned off my PC.  I powered it back on and tried again.  This time I even launched iTunes and Windows Media Player manually to try to nudge it along. Still, nothing.  I finally gave up and decided to try the gamepad.

As a gamepad, the buttons are kind of awkwardly placed.  By awkward, I mean my hand feels a bit cramped when holding it.  The controller was detected in my games with no problem and I was able to assign buttons and play without any issues.  Although it functioned as a capable controller, it just had an overall generic feel compared to a dedicated programmable controller.  I guess after playing with Xbox/PS3 style controllers on PC for so long, it's hard to go back to a small cramped controller with closely spaced buttons, especially when playing games that require rapid precise movements and actions.  I would likely only use a gamepad like this when traveling if I wanted to pack light and avoid carrying both a mouse and gamepad.

In the end, had this been a purchased item instead of a Vine review, I would have very likely ultimately returned it.  It is an ambitious design and a very good idea but the execution is just a little off and the performance is too inconsistent.  I'm curious to try it on my Mac and likely will do so once I get the Mac back from repair.  It didn't like my Win 7 64-bit PC at all and only liked my Win 7 32-bit PC a tad bit better.  If I had to grade each aspect of the controller I'd give the mouse a B on Win 7 32-bit, and F on Win 7 64-bit.  Remote control N/A on 64-bit (since it was not tried after mouse failed to work properly) and D- on Win 7 32-bit (would have scored another F had the one lone power button also failed to work).  Gamepad gets a B- on both 64 and 32-bit."
1781,2,"****November 2011 Addendum****

The game is fun overall.  Multiplayer is a fun experience, even despite the repetitive nature of it.  I had previously complained that the game was so unbalanced, they had to remove dozens of units from the multiplayer experience.  Even with them out, multiplayer is still GROSSLY unbalanced.  Units like the Thor and the Void Ray are ridiculously overpowered compared to virtually every other unit, and they have no real counter; the Zerg have no counter for them---Hydralisks are inexplicably weak against Void Rays, Mutalisks are killed far too easily, and Thors have a hidden splash attack with their Anti-Air missiles, which does double damage to light units (ie, mutalisks).  This attack is to Void Rays and Mutalisks what fire is to rice paper.

There is no unit balance as Starcraft had; it's become an arms race; first person to spam Thors or Void Rays wins.

*****

And to think the biggest worry I had upon seeing screenshots early on was that the buildings and units looked so bloated, fat, and cartoony.  In fact they do seem rather bloated and cartoony compared to their Starcraft counterparts, but it's not nearly as horrendous as I'd initially thought it out to be.

To get the easy stuff out of the way: If you care not for the story and only for the gameplay, then 3 stars out of 5 is a fair rating.

I don't know why Starcraft was so innovative a game as it was.  It simply looked different, smooth and was extremely well-balanced.  It was a slick game with easily identifiable units on the field with easily identifiable sounds, weapons, and controls and interface.  It was an innovation and improvement over the engine used in Warcraft II.

Here, there is none.  They claimed to have completely re-made the engine from scratch, but you could copy and paste the UI onto Command & Conquer 3 or Command & Conquer 4 and it would look pretty much the same.  It's not at all a bad thing, but it's not really a good thing either if you're looking to play this as a new game.  It essentially feels like C&C3 with cartoonier units.

The game mechanics that went into making Starcraft so incredibly balanced will have to be re-discovered here, as new units are frequent in coming, old units have stats changed, and units like the Medic become essential for infantry squads, as they auto-heal when you move or attack-move them with a group, rather than wandering out up into an enemy because you'd need to micro-manage them directly.

Initially I'd have considered the Protoss terribly, horribly, atrociously overpowered due to weapons like the Colossus and the Void Ray, but later missions showed that there was more to come for Zerg and Terran to even the odds.  This, however, says very very little for traditional defensive units like the Photon Cannon, Bunkers, and units like the Zealot.  You may as well not even make them anymore, unless you plan on massing them in gargantuan numbers, as they contribute next to nothing within huge armies, whereas in Starcraft, the melee abilities of a Zealot made it essential under a Defiler's swarm ability, or for fast attacks.

But the absolute bane of this entry of the franchise is undoubtedly the writing.

Virtually everything Jim Raynor or Tychus Findlay or Matt Horner says can be found in one line or another from any other movie, TV show, or video game.  There's almost nothing anyone says that isn't cliche', stupid, poorly delivered, or so bland and generic you can skip it and miss out on nothing.

Remember Arcturus Mengsk.  Remember Mengsk of Korhal, and how the Confederacy nuked Korhal into an uninhabitable wasteland.  Remember how Mengsk fought and bled and suffered to fight them, with his rebel group the Sons of Korhal.  He was a character so morally ambiguous that he would suffer in order to help civilians, and then out of utter rage and vengeance, use psi emitters to obliterate entire Confederate planets, drawing billions of Zerg onto Antigua Prime and Tarsonis.

He wanted to (and successfully did) end the war and end the Confederacy, and not end up spending decades fighting hard guerrilla war with the Confederate remnants.  He mad a bad decision, it was the wrong one, but he made it, and he was going to live with it.  He was like Joseph Stalin in his ceaseless aggression to power and to the safety and security of all Terrans.

The Arcturus Mengsk in Starcraft 2 is better compared with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  He and his administration create laws so blatantly false and outrageous, even CHILDREN would not fall for it.  And this is presented CONSTANTLY in the form of UNN broadcasts featuring an obvious parody of news pundits.  One mission sees you, Raynor's rebels, liberate a civilian area from the Zerg and Dominion forces.  This is then reported on the news where a field reporter reports to the UNN pundit.  He then asks about civilian casualties, and the reporter says ""Actually, the only civilian casualties thus far have been crossfire from overzealous Dominion forces"" and as soon as she finishes, they panickedly go back to the pundit who panickedly remarks ""Uh, well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen; Jim Raynor, killing innocent women and children!""

The actions of Arcturus Mengsk, having civilians rounded up and slaughtered, or encouraging neighbors to spy on one another, or abandoning half his Dominion  at the first sign of Zerg threat so as to protect his core worlds, is so completely out of character for the Starcraft Mengsk that it's a farce.  It's buffoonery, and it's made less funny if you've played the Terran campaign in Starcraft 1.

But the absolute worst has to be Zeratul and the Protoss.

In Starcraft, the Protoss were the big tough fanatical race.  They were loyal, courageous, religious, and xenophobic.  They had highly advanced technology, but otherwise were very much like the Terrans in terms of being well-rounded, with good people and bad people making good decisions and bad decisions.

In Starcraft 2, you could replace them with night elves in World of Warcraft or any random race of wizards or magicians from any medieval fantasy work involving people speaking with stunted syllables about ancient prophecies and fallen ones and doom.

TVTropes has something called ""Flanderization"", named for Ned Flanders in ""The Simpsons"", who believe it or not, was once a NORMAL character who was religious, but also did ""naughty"" things and drank beer and such.  ""Flanderization"" refers to taking ONE character trait of an otherwise normal character, and making that trait THE defining characteristic of it, to the exclusion of all else.

This has happened BIG TIME with the Protoss, where religious fanaticism and mysticism has now become the defining trait of the Protoss.  Nothing Zeratul (or Nibbler, as I call him, because he's voiced by the same actor) says is not painful to listen to, straight out of every Lord of the Rings knockoff, good or bad, and done worse.

Mild Spoilers abound here:  For whatever reason, whereas Raynor and the Terrans are written at a third grade level of vocabulary and storytelling, Zeratul is written at a kindergarten level.  It becomes teeth-gnashingly irritating to have a cutscene show you where to go, and to have Zeratul SLOWLY exclaim ""I must go over there and link with that thing, but there are Zerg in the way!  They may be... problematic"", or a mission where Zerg attack your base every three minutes, and when there's thirty seconds left, Zeratul ALWAYS says ""The Zerg are massing for an attack!  To arms!""

Zeratul's fight with Kerrigan is not so much a fight as a World of Warcraft-looking cutscene featuring an exchange of magic pixie powers---I mean, ""psionic energy""

And then comes Zeratul's FIRST crowning moment of stupidity (because there's at least two) that comes as such a smack in the face to Starcraft fans, it becomes less the fault of the character, and more the fault of BAD WRITING.  Zeratul encounters a Protoss/Zerg Hybrid, and then states in that stilted, bland and monotonous delivery ""Who could have created such a thing?""

DID NO ONE ON THE WRITING STAFF EVEN READ THE SCRIPTS OF THE FIRST GAME, NOT EVEN NEEDING TO PLAY IT?

So while you're saying ""Duran"" again and again and again, the next mission comes and here's Zeratul's stupidity that is again the fault of bad writing, not because of total ignorance of the first game, but out of just bad writing:

Zeratul encounters the ""ghost"" of an old friend.  The FIRST THING this old friend says is ""I have come to you from beyond this world"", and the FIRST THING Zeratul says is ""But you died!""

The idiocy then continues as this old friend tells the story of the Overmind and its true purpose, and Zeratul chimes in POINTLESS commentary that only shows how utterly STUPID he is, not able to use age as an excuse to not understand the concept of ""lies"" and ""ulterior motives"" and ""not everything is as it seems"".  The old friend remarks something about the Overmind, and Zeratul says ""DUH DUH BUT, THE, OVERMIND, WAS, A, MONSTROSITY!"" and this old friend has to chide Zeratul like a child that it only SEEMED this way to him.

I remark on World of Warcraft and magical fantasy a lot in this review.  Know that I am not trashing on the genre, or on World of Warcraft.  It is likely a fine game, but my point is that it is an entirely different genre game from this.  The same way you wouldn't want to see rubber-forehead aliens in ""Battlestar Galactica"" or slapstick comedy in ""Schindler's List"", I don't want to see magical fantasy-type superstition and talks of ""Prophecy"", ""Chosen One"", ""Fallen One"", ""the Damned"", ""Doom"", and such in a hard science fiction game.

In fact Starcraft 2 does seem at times like that one disastrous step that Warcraft 3 did with the series; turning it from low-fantasy into high-fantasy, which actually went on to greater things in acquiring a whole new fanbase with World of Warcraft.

It doesn't fit on Starcraft 2.  And seeing the Starcraft series go from something dark, ambiguous, and hard, to something literally at grade-school level in its simplicity, is like watching a childhood hero succumb to drugs or alcohol."
1782,2,When I bought this game I was like cool its a game about a pirate controlling an island. Its got ok graphics. I never played the original Tropico so I couldn't tell you the differences. I played the game for about 5 hours. The only exciting part I found was sending the ships out to raid areas (when i played there was only one place to raid) Funny thing is they would never run out of people or be smart enought to move to another place (means not realistic). You would never see these raids. If you build too fast you would run out of captives. Very annoying. The whole fear thing on the captives doesn't mean anything. I never lost one captive. You could buy it or not its up to you!
1783,2,this was given to me as an easter present and don t waste ur money on this verision!  get it for ps3.  this verison is a huge down graded verision and honestly if feels so imcomplete because so much was cut.  only reason why this verision got 2 stars was because some of the levels are good and the music is also good
1784,2,"We bought this for our 5 year old son, the whiz of the Xbox. He's beat many many games - even more so than his dad or I. But this one was one of those games that none of us in the family could get past. There's something about how you move or swim that just wasn't set up right to where you knew where you were going. We very rarely ever get this game out - except to dust."
1785,2,Oof......
1786,2,"Too easy, not pretty, bad voice acting; is this really a Metal Gear game?"
1787,2,"In my time I've used many microphones but I've never seen one that died as quickly as this set. The sound quality on the pink/red one never was very good - you had to sing very loudly into it for it to pick up your voice. It died quicker than the blue but the blue one started to go soon after. We had these microphones for about 3 months of light use and careful storage before we had to replace them.

The only good thing I can say about this set is that the adapter works great for other microphones. We bought Audio-Technica Unidirectional mics to replace these and they work wonderfully with the Singstar adapter on our PS2 and the Wii. No need to buy a new adapter or microphones. It's the adapter that kept me from rating this product as 1 star.

If you're looking for microphones for a singing game, I'd only recommend these for the adapter. For the actual mics go with something else."
1788,2,"A few things about the game, the controls are horrible, steering is poor at best.  I can never win a race or let alone have a chance of winning because of the oversteer on these trucks.  I'm 34 and me and my son whose 5 play this game, he has fun driving around and wrecking things.  As far as racing he doesnt know any better."
1789,2,"Ok - I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book and the British movie with Sean Connery, et al.  So I think - cool - I can play a game that will have some of the same beautiful settings as the book/movie.  While this is true - the graphics are good and the overall look of the game is nice - the game play is HORRIBLE.  Once I figured out all the characters are exactly the same as the book and the plot is exactly the same, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach about the $30 I had just spent...

Good Things -
* There is an alternate ending that the game makers have added in to at least add a little bit of interest to the finale.
* Some of the puzzles take a little bit of thought to figure them out.
* Pretty pictures and engaging play keeps you interested.
* You tell the gathered suspects how the murder happened at the end based upon your clues.  Be sure to review all your clues before Poirot is carried into the Salon Car to reveal the murderer.

Bad Things -
* Game is very linear.  There is no veering from the track that is set for you.  There are several places where you HAVE TO solve certain puzzles before you are allowed to go on.  However it is often hard to know if you are done investigating or not.
* Some of the puzzles are infantile in simplicity and 2 of the puzzles are SO HARD that there is no way to solve w/o downloading the cheat.  I'm not kidding - one of the puzzles you will never get in a 1000 years.  This seriously detracts from the game play.
* You play a game with Poirot (who is bedridden with a bruised ankle during much of the game play) to see if you can figure ""IT"" out with little or no help from him.  This should be a positive.  However, in many parts of the game you don't know if you are done until you come back to talk to him and if you aren't, he docks you.  Not really fair.  And at the end, the game doesn't give you any kind of score or whatever to gauge how well you did.
* If you know the book, you know the plot, who did it, and how it's solved.  This fact makes the game play simply a job to get to the end.

I really wanted to like this game, but it's hard.  95% of the game play is just dull plugging and chugging and searching for clues or solving easy puzzles, while the other 5% is impossible - not a great combo.  I doubt I'll by ""And Then There Were None"" either based upon the game play of this Christie game.  (Follow-up Note:  Yes, I was dumb enough to buy ATTWN...  At least I only spent $5 this time.  Same boring gameplay though - maybe third time will be the charm?)

Unless you have NEVER, EVER read this book/seen the movie, look somewhere else."
1790,2,The stick controllers are not smooth but kind of stick then jump in the direction you push so the camera & character are hard to control on FPS games. The rubber side grips pop off and are hard to pop back in place so we had to super glue them in place. Would not connect to the PS3 at first so had to play with the wire connected for a few hours before it connected wirelessly.
1791,2,This game plays out like a board game. It's turn based and can be hard to play if you're not used to this type of gameplay (like me). I didn't so much enjoy this game. It's well layed out and can be great fun if you have a great understanding of the paths to take. I couldn't get down a successful pattern though. You have to perform research for your civilization and you have to do so in an effective order or you'll die or just lose another way. There are too many aspects of this game for me to enjoy it.
1792,2,"Did not work on my 7/64
JL."
1793,2,"My old controller was constantly having a problem with the wires and the game would tell me it had been disconnected so I decided it was time to purchase a new controller. The new one worked okay for the first month or two, despite a problem with the black button trying to stick quite a bit, however it started having the same problem and now if I move the controller the slightest bit, the games tell me the controller was disconnected and I need to reconnect it. This happens every few seconds and it makes game play extremely difficult. I don't know if it's possible to find an good controller anymore for the old Xbox or not but it sure would be great if I could find one!

To add a note to the problem... the wire is all straight and not twisted and I have no idea why it keeps giving me the error. This is just yet another example where Microsoft products are nothing but trouble...."
1794,2,"Wow, I don't even know how to write this. I am a bit disappointed with this next gen ""HD"" graphic. Tons of people say they don't care about the graphic. Well, this is a video game. If we don't factor in the graphic, then we can just do text based RPG and use our imagination.
This game requires you to be well versed of the FF crystalis(?) story, which I don't. All those names sound so fake, the cut scenes are long and the loading time is long too. You can skip the cut scenes but then you will miss out on the story.
The interface is out dated, the voice acting (English) is pretty awful and the story is not enticing (to most Westerners.)
If you are a big fan of FF, it probably is fine. This is definitely a niche game targeted for very specific population of gamers. Sorry this is just not my cup of tea."
1795,2,"As a horror fan, gaming fan, and forensic freak, I was waiting with baited breath for this to come out.  The graphics are something to behold - unbelievable environments and character movement.  However, I just cannot get into this game because of the ridiculously laughable plot.  In the first mission you are just walking around, and creatures made out of tar start skulking around and attacking you.  At this point I have no concept of why I am being attacked by tar-monsters (according to the box this is a story about catching a serial killer).  Subsequently, you are attacked by posessed baby dolls, freaks in chain-mail, a wild, posessed grizzly bear (who somehow knows exactly where you are at any time inside a building complex), and the ""alcohol monster"" which is YOU with some mummy-face.  Now I am fighting a ""mad magic-man"", who I have to kill with bottles of booze.  Are you kidding me?  This plot is pathetic!  What a waste!  Can someone also please explain how you can somehow transmit tissue samples to the lab using your PDA while you are standing in the wilderness.  Come on man!  This is so dumb!  I am very disappointed."
1796,2,"I want to start by saying that I wanted to play this game mostly for the exercise, a ""get up off the couch and get moving"" game. It got me up and moving but I lost interest in it quickly. To me, playing tennis should be about control over where you hit the ball. This game just isn't consistent in moving the ball in the direction that you hit it. I tried the game because I enjoyed Wii Sports Tennis so much. I thought it would play like that game, but with more features and details since it's a stand alone game. But I was disappointed in that I wasn't able to have the same amount of control over the ball as I had in Wii Sports Tennis, and for me that's the point of the game. You can use the nunchuk for a little more body control, but that makes it seems less like you're actually playing tennis. I haven't ever played the GameCube version, so I can't comment on the differences between the two.

The graphics are very good, as you'd expect with a Nintendo Mario game. The characters from the Mushroom Kingdom are cute and the music is entertaining. I think it might be a better game for a kid or casual players than for an adult. I could also see it as a family game played with different ages. But for one or two adults, it just didn't do it for me."
1797,2,The City skyline and apartments views are interesting but other than that Ho-Hum.
1798,2,i thought this game was for the 360... my bad...
1799,2,"After seeing how bad this product truly was, I decided to set up a test. I tested trading Pokmon between to GBA SPs, one running Fire Red, the other running Leaf Green. Out of 50 trade attempts, 44 ended in a communication error. Only 6 of those attempts were successful. The heads on the cable seem to big or just mishapen to fit in any GBA system I tried and overall I'd say it's not worth it whatsoever. I cannot recommend an alternative because most of the others are unbranded."
1800,2,"I loved MK9 for the PS3, it was my favorite game in the franchise other than Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PS2.
That being said, I gave Mortal Kombat X for the PS4 a try and got my platinum. Now I'm selling it here, and writing an honest review.

Pros:
1.) Nine fresh, new characters. Plus 4 DLC characters. (Tanya, Tremor, Jason, and Predator)
2.) Variation system that lets you play all 29 characters in three different fighting styles.
3.) Great graphics, Brutalities are back.

Cons:
01.) The biggest issue I have with the game is that they took 2 vs 2 versus out of the game, which makes Two Player mode very boring.
02.) A lot less blood, this is the least bloody Mortal Kombat that I've ever seen.
03.) Slow gameplay. Does not seem as fast paced as MK9, character kombos no longer work as fluidly as they used to.
04.) Sonya and Reptile play completely differently and you will have to relearn them if these were your main characters.
05.) Ermac, Raiden, and Sonya got nerfed. Ermac now loses constantly to Kung Jin, and honestly, to everyone.
06.) Smoke, Cyrax, Sektor, Sindel, Stryker, Noob, Jade, Rain, Baraka, Motaro, Kintaro, and Fujin are not playable, most aren't mentioned at all.
07.) Story mode is relatively short, provides very little entertainment.
08.) The netcode for Online play is royally frustrating. Warner can't seem to keep their servers up all day. Matchmaking takes forever.
09.) No babalities, no animalities, no friendships.
10.) Say goodbye to 45%+ dmg kombos. The highest i've seen is a 34% dmg kombo that was linked into an x-ray.
11.) Jade will not be returning, her moveset was given to Kitana under the Mournful variation.
12.) Only 45-60 hours of gameplay. Kung Jin - Bojutsu causes latency for the opponent making him overpowered. This might get patched.
13.) Lots of costumes require you to have a mobile device with 1 gb of ram to play the app to unlock them in your console version.
14.) Related to no. 13, we now have micro-transactions everywhere. In both console and in the mobile app.
15.) People like me paid $100 for four characters that are /still/ not here yet. A lot of people have nothing left to do in the game right now.
16.) The stages seem a bit dull. There are no stage fatalities either.

 Two stars is honest, because according to the description of the choice to rate it 2 stars, it means 'I don't like it'. Well, I don't. When I pay $100 for a game and my main character plays nothing like she used to, and my other main character plays nothing like he used to and I platinum a game and I'm still waiting for my content that I paid $50 extra for and I'm expected to play a mobile app to unlock content in a console game; then I have every right to feel like saying 'I'm done with this series for good.'

  You might like Mortal Kombat X if you are new to it, but a lot of people that are familiar with the series when it was at its high point probably won't like it at all. The best thing that I can say about Mortal Kombat X is that the new characters are cool, if not, overpowered and that Reptile is more fun to play as for me, but probably isn't for people that used him as their main character for previous installments of the series. Being a Sonya player, I can't rate it higher than 2-stars, my main character is impossible to use. I had to go use Kitana instead..."
1801,2,"This memory card hasn't been reliable, my first one stopped working out of the blue after a few months.  When I replaced it, thinking that I just was unlucky, the new one is already having problems after a few weeks with corrupt data."
1802,2,don't use it
1803,2,"The Smurfs 2 game is based upon the recent and rather disastrous film and is another licensed game that it appears to have been just thrown to market to cash in on the film.  Papa Smurf and the rest of the gang have to rescue Smurfette from the clutches of the Naughties which are basically anti-Smurfs created by the wizard Gargamel.  The game is a side-scrolling platformer and as such, very old school.  It kind of reminds me of something like the old Sonic games for Sega or Super Mario Brothers.

You run and jump across 6 worlds, each with 5 worlds, either avoiding or jumping on enemies and picking up collectibles and smurfberries.  You can play as several different character Smurfs, each with their own special ability.  Jokey can toss a present that explodes, destroying the enemy from a distance. Hefty throws a barbell that returns to him like a boomerang, allowing him to hit enemies from afar, etc...

The graphics are ok.  The backgrounds are nice and the world designs are colorful but they hardly take full advantage of the Xbox 360's capabilities.  The game's only appeal is going to be to the younger kids, I'd say ages 5 - 10."
1804,2,"PROS:
This game was very fun, and very inventive.
It is a game that everyone should play. When you do though, play it for at least a couple of hours to get used to it though.
The controls are goofy and frustrating at first, but once you get used to them, you wonder why you would want to do it any other way.

So, coolness and fun, I give this game 4 or 5 stars.

CONS:
This game just ends right in the middle of the plot. You have to buy the next 2 games to find out what is going on.
This game doesn't end on a sub-plot like the HALO franchise, or any other for that matter. With most games, you expect the ending is coming and at least something gets wrapped up. It's like playing HALO half way through and then just throwing the game away.
So, to play 1 actual game, you are going to have to spend darn near $200 for all 3. Again, this doesn't end really on a sub-plot either. You find out a piece of information, and then the credits role and tell you to buy the second one.

So, this game was fun, but do NOT buy it. Rent it, spend a day or two on it and give it back."
1805,2,I don't ilke it my ps4 still over heats
1806,2,"This game is good. I love the Call of Duty franchise and I love the Battlefield Franchise. I've been playing both since I was a kid.

I can say that both games are good. They are fun.. much fun. Both have their pros and cons. I'm not a hater on CoD or Battlefield.

The thing is with MW3.. It's really just MW2.... nothing changed really with the menu, nothing changed with the guns, nothing changed with the graphics really, nothing changed with the sound effects. It is all the same!!! If you can remember the sound effects of the flashbang and concussion bang and frag grenade dropping, it will ring to your ear as MW2.

It's boring kind of. I was playing it and I felt like I was playing Modern Warfare 2 just with different maps and kill streak settings.

Modern Warfare 3... you are fun. but you aren't new. It's still the same. I think the Modern Warfare era needs to come to an end after this one or the next one.... and I hope if they do make a 4th MW... it's no where near the same as these last 3. If Call of Duty does continue... please make some kind of Colonial game or go back into history of the Civil War, try something new? I have no idea, but the idea of World War I and II is really to old to keep making games around and the Modern era of war fighting games is kind of boring now because its something we see every day on the news or t.v. or in movies.

I'm disappointed in the game pretty much you can say. It's a big big let down from all the hype in my opinion. It's just Modern Warfare 2. ..thats all it is. Just with a few minor changes and small upgrades that aren't noticeable really."
1807,2,"These got a second start because they are indeed tri wing screwdrivers. They're terrible. They're tiny. If you have stubborn screws it's really hard to apply enough pressure, and actually doing so is pretty painful. I think I've got two striped screws despite giving as much pressure on the screw as possible with these awful screwdrivers."
1808,2,"Far Cry 2 is OK. It's nothing to write home about, though.

My issues with the game:
1. - Guns - Who did the firearm research on this game? Some guns, like the AK-47, are completely mirror image. Some, like the HK G3, are just wrong. (Charging handle and ejection port both on the left side? Not in this reality.)
2. - Damage - Shooting someone in the chest with 10-20 rounds from the PKM to kill them? Zzzzz.
3. - No prone? Come on, is this the 90s?
4. - Enemies can see me in the dead of night, and know where I am, even when I am in the bushes and using a silencer. Hmmm...
5. - Repetative missions - Wow, let's do the same missions over and over and over and over and over...
6. - Respawning badguys. Just cleared that guard post? Funny that all the guards are back 3 minutes later...
7. - ""Most realistic fire ever!"" - with fire graphics that look completely unrealistic.

Give this property back to Crytech. Ubisoft did a half-baked job at best.

EDIT: Also, the DRM this game installs broke the Burn feature of Windows Media Player on my PC. Buyer Beware.

EDIT 2: SecuRom has a program on their website that will allow you to remove their DRM from your machine. However, it will be reinstalled - without warning or notification - the very next time you play a game with SecuRom DRM. If - like me - you have issues with burning CDs after installing one of these game, you pretty much have to uninstall the DRM anytime you want to burn. Convenient, huh?"
1809,2,"To play this game you will need endless patience. If you don't have that, don't waste your money on this. This is a trial and error type game meaning that half the experience is you dying just so you can try something different to only die again. To die 30 times at a particular part is okay in my book. But to wait for a 30 second load screen every time you die is inexcusable. Sometimes you have to wait for the load screen and part of a movie scene you can't skip right away. Is this 2014 or 1990?

Like other Resident Evil games it relies on shock and jump scares to scare players. It works for a duration but eventually you become numb to it. It started to feel more like an action game with the hordes of enemies it starts to throw at you in the later chapters. Now blowing off the heads of zombies is fun, don't get me wrong, but add on to the zombie killing clunky controls and bad camera angles where things like bushes totally block your view, and you start to wonder what this game is even trying to be. If you're playing an action game, smooth controls is an absolute must. Clunky controls work well for a survival horror because it makes it harder to retreat but it fails as a survival horror when there's a million horrors coming after you. A successful horror game keeps you guessing the unknown, not just throwing hordes of enemies at you. So, simply put, this game just does not know what it wants to be. It's trying to be two things at once which is totally stupid. If I wanted to play an action game with monsters I would just go play Modern Warfare zombies.

Long gone are the days of a proper Silent Hill game or Fatal Frame. Siren, although excruciating and difficult, was a much better survival horror. The first 3 Resident Evils were also great horror games. Penumbra was great lovecraftian fun. Amnesia is a real horror game. The Evil Within has no idea what it wants to be. It is neither action nor horror, and tries desperately to be both. Save your money, rent the game or wait for it to hit the bargain bin. I am not saying that a great number of people would not love this game. Plenty of people would. But this review is not for all those people. You know who you are if you're reading this review."
1810,2,is not very resistant
1811,2,"Starting with the positives. The ergonomics are really nice, especially if your hands are on the larger side. Mine aren't, so I had difficulty reaching the topmost side button with my pointer finger. That's not a strike against the mouse, so much as my small, Trump-like appendages.

On to the criticisms. The bottom button started sticking almost immediately after I started using it (like within a week of light use). The build quality seems good on the outside (sturdy plastic shell and strong braided cable) but the internal mechanisms that control the actual buttons could definitely use another round of QA.

Second gripe: Razer Synapse and no on-board memory for saving button configurations, DPI, or light settings. You have to leave Razer's Synapse bloatware running in the background at all times, or your custom settings and button mapping won't work. The software itself is extremely bare bones, and doesn't offer much in the way of customization. The memory requirements and startup speed of the app are trivial, but as a gamer, it's more the principle of having yet another needless processes squatting in the background that really irritates me. Doubly so because Synapse REQUIRES signing up for an utterly pointless Razer account before you can even use the mouse, which is yet another layer of log-ins and DRM that stand in the way between you and your gaming.

In summary: Your mileage will vary with respect to the build quality issues, plenty of people have had no issues even after years of use. I wasn't so lucky. How annoying you find account-based DRM baked into your hardware will also vary. I'm obviously not a fan, but once you get it set up you'll probably be able to ignore it safely (assuming their servers stay on).

Personally, I'm going to recommend picking up a Logitech G502 instead. Similar price if you shop around, more functionality, better software, and on-board profile saving."
1812,2,"Absolute garbage. Boring game,dumb plot. Nice graphics tho. I do not recommend this game."
1813,2,Basically a demo you have to pay for
1814,2,"Before I'm vilified for making a constructive criticism of Final Fantasy XII, let me first say that I have been a fan of this series well before you were all twinkle in your fathers' eyes. Final Fantasy XII is essentially an MMORPG with the online element removed, but still retains the riveting action of drying paint in MMORPG glory!  Final Fantasy XII had great promise, but fell short a couple thousand miles.  This game was all eye candy and no story! When watching the game's opening, you'll think you're in for one HELL of a treat (I certainly did!), but as the story ""progresses"", you'll have this nagging voice in the back of your mind, asking, ""Hey, when is this game going to START?"" and a truck load of back tracking and useless quests that would have Silent Hill 4's Henry Townsend  feel badly for you! I'll try my best to condense this review.
First, let's review the pros:

Pros:

-Gorgeous FMVs and graphics

-A talented and skilled cast of voice actors (kids, believe it or not, there's a world of difference between ""bad voice acting"" and your opinion of whether or not a particular actor's voice fits the character)

-Balthier.  This character was a real card--and about the only character  that was ""alive"" in this snore-fest. Take Balthier out, and this game would have NOTHING!

-Customizable characters.  No more archetypical, spineless, female white or black magic users that are killed by weak enemies! Now they can raise hell with battle axes and guns! GET SOME!

Cons:

-The story.  Where the HELL is the story? When your television is graced with the game's introduction, you'll get pumped and truly believe you're going to receive a colossal bang for your buck! A truly legendary tale full of war, sacrifice, honor..you know-all that good stuff. These expectations begin to fizzle 45 minutes into the game.  The military occupation of Dalmasca by the ""mighty"" Archadian Empire feels about as tense and menacing as...cardboard. Their presence is hardly even noticed! The developers attempted to add some political intrigue in there, but they seem to have forgotten about it in exchange for pointless side quests and some other equally flat villain that was ""BEHIND THE SCENES!1!11!"". Some particular characters decide to stab you in the back for no reason whatsoever.  Konami's Suikoden II (a PS1 game) did a much better job than these guys in terms of a tyrannical enemy occupation.

-The Characters. With the exception of Balthier and Ashe, none of these characters were memorable. They were all flat and one dimensional with virtually no interaction with one another. For example, what was the depth of Balthier and Fran's relationship? If you were to write out the other characters in your party, you wouldn't even miss them. I assumed Vaan was supposed to be the main protagonist, but he was suddenly tossed to the back seat for Ashe and Balthier, and was only given a few lines after that.  A few other characters were thrown in (Al-Cid, The Judges, Archadian Senate), but really had not purpose either. (Even Fran seemed pissed off about this game!)

-Battle System. Was too damn slow for my tastes.

-Music.  Whomever this new person is, they're surely no Uematsu or Sugiyama!

-Licensing Board.  This is truly a double edged sword.  Whereas I liked customizing my characters, having to get a ""license"" via the licensing board just to equip a friggin' HELMET will get on your nerves.

Because of certain negative factors that plagued this game, I feel that this title was rated with a double standard, simply because ""Final Fantasy"" is in the name.  If this were a regular run of the mill RPG, I'm sure it would have been graded harshly."
1815,2,"this game is fun to play a little everyday, and if you get stuck just You Tube it and get the way through it it's all on you tube, helps a lot, the battle are fun and controls are fluid like, would definitely recommend for a fun cheap game.
update: got the part with the bird and it's impossible to beat took all the fun out of the game, had to restart the thing for those chapters set to ez and put the game away wasn't even fun anymore, and never made it back to where I was, got a new game and it took presidence but if you think you can just play this game through on normal good luck, the boss bird won everytime for about four days worth of trying, even with you tube walktrhoughs still lost.  So beware that before you buy this game dropped star level from five to two."
1816,2,"I like RPGs, Mass Effect 1 and 2, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Dragon Age, and most recently Skyrim are amongst my favorite games ever, so when i choose to try out FF i was expecting something very different, just walk, fight (mostly pressing x) and walk again and fight again, and if you turn back the same enemies are expecting you. After around 10 hours of this i decided to give up and made the decission that this game was not made for me.

The game is beautiful, is the best thing it has, the graphics are amazing, the enviroments and model all look great.

Its too bad, i was starting to get interested in the story, but the repetitive gameplay made me quit."
1817,2,"Do you want to save your game sometimes? If so, you will have to finish an entire level. I thought I would never get that far. (Yes, I have spent a great deal of time playing games that are this difficult, but better designed). After you get the the 2nd level, what if you want to start a new game? The only way I could do it was to go to the Windows Task Manager and kill the process. After that, I had to restart the game and watch the video intro again. I know they are proud of the graphics (yes, I liked the movie), but...."
1818,2,"As many others have said, this game is nothing like the previous Ghost Recon games. Don't try to compare it.

The experience as it's own game is awful. The interface is confusing and clunky. At certain points of character progression, you're offered choices between attachments, but since your characters are split between factions and their items are completely different, you are shown the choices for the faction you're currently in. I've been playing for a bit hoping the game gets better, and I still don't know if I make a choice if it affects the other faction, because when I go into a new room and get placed on the other faction, I try to set up that faction's weapons to match the one I was just using so I can sortof know what to expect, which takes up all of the lobby time so I don't remember to go see what happened with the progression choice.

If that paragraph didn't make sense, then I got my point across. The UI is too bloated with flashy/glitchy menu options and graphics to give it the futuristic technological feel, it doesn't get you right into the game like UI should.

The Game Modes:

Campaign - The only part you'll probably have fun with. If you have 4 people or not, some of the mechanics you encounter are pretty neat (synchronized kills, hostage-guarding formations). Some of the reviews mentioned that it's on rails - and that's exactly what it is. This game should stop trying to copy Call of Duty.

Guerilla - Where Terrorist Hunt should be, you have defense against waves. This can be fun but just becomes tiresome. Lots of games have wave defense, but only Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six have had really good terrorist hunt modes.

Multiplayer - The real crap. Where Ghost Recon used to have sprawling maps with cover for snipers as well as close quarters, this version of the game has more Call of Duty-esque run 'n' gun. It's also ironic that it only has objective-based multiplayer because they ""didn't want to make it run 'n' gun"". So what happens when you have an objective across the map that you have to take and defend in 60-120 seconds? Definitely not strategic combat, not with match-made strangers. In previous Ghost Recons, if you rushed a match you got to sit and wait until the next one. Sure that may not be for everyone, but just because Call of Duty recycles the same old crap and sells out doesn't mean you should copy them.

Wrap-up:
I've had the game since launch and given it multiple tries, and only a few brief nights of fun where the rest are just frustrating. You're going to run into better players and not win every match, but when everything changes one night to the next, there's definitely something weird going on. Some of the bullet/hit recognition is actually worse than Call of Duty Black Ops (in Black Ops, for me, it was easier to hit people with a crossbow half a block away than with an automatic weapon 4 feet away from behind). Last night in Ghost Recon, I had run off someone's screen - literally the kill cam evaluation showed me run straight past someone and they fired three times with a sniper rifle (not even scoped, just aimed down the sights) up some steps where I came from and somehow killed me. That was the kicker - that's not even lag, that's just garbage. I've already gone to GameStop and canceled my preorder for the upcoming expansion."
1819,2,My fingers still slipped off when I used these.
1820,2,"Bought this game based on the 5 star reviews and and somehow praise in the press and am mystified as to what all the fuss is about. I find snake as a character almost unbearingly annoying to have. I mean you almost want him to just go away. The cutscenes are dreadfull and god looooong and the controls are just weird. Switching weapons on the main menu lol.

Either its a movie or its a video game,it does neither very well at all. In that sense the game is a disaster. Devoted about 3 hours to this game and was pressing on in disbief at just how bored,unimpressed and at times horrible the game was. Vide games are supposed to be fun,,,this isnt.

Resistance the fal of man has a story that blows this one away too and that is short brief and to the point..Is snake so interesting??? Now I am stuck with this game to gather dust or sell for a few dollars at best."
1821,2,"This had to be the most boring game I ever played.  I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to a real game.  You learn a set of skills and basically use them through the rest of the game to do the same thing--enter (through hacking), fight, and hack a solution.  That's it.  And you can bypass most fighting by calling in other gangs to wipe out the opposition--so you really don't have to fight much either.  The network hack puzzles are so incredibly simple a 6-year old could figure them out. The clandestine entry using sets of tools reminded me of Dishonored--which is much much much better at handling hacks.  The use of multiple skills reminded me of Infamous Second Son, which changes the whole game 3 times over to get to the end so you have to adapt to upgraded skills as you go along--a much more enjoyable and challenging game than this.  And the swearing...every other word --even by random pedestrians on the street--is a swear word.  Does this make it seem ""edgy""?  No--makes it seem like you're trying to fool the audience into thinking this is a kicking action player when in fact its a slow, boring trek through simplistic exercises that your child could do, but you wouldn't let them because of the vulgarity.  The one saving grace is the storyline--which is inviting, but not exciting.  The game tops all this off with a prolonged epilogue explaining how the network will take over the world--but who cares--just give me the credits and lets put this on the street for next week's city pickup."
1822,2,compared to other titles out there d3 isn't as bad as everyone says it is. a lot of folks out there call it a prettier version of d2. isn't that a big part of why you're moving on to d3? because d2 was so fun? my only complaint is i put in about 30 hours of gameplay and apparently got hacked. i waited a few days for blizzard to respond and they offered me a roll back. they didn't let me know that i was going to be rolled back 10 levels. lost a bunch of gold and items because of their flawed security system. gg blizzard you lost a customer but hey you already took me $60 so shouldn't effect you much.
1823,2,"This controller seems like it could be good, the gyro is a bit wonky but nice. My problem is I was shipped a defective product, the right pad does not function properly. When I go into the steam controller test menu and hold my thumbs to the pads the following happens: The left pad has a green circle that appears and if I hold my thumb still, it does not move as it should and that's great! However the right pad when I hold my thumb still on it the green dot flickers and shakes, it does this across the whole pad.

The feedback is also broken between the pads, the right and left feel so weird.

Overall this controller would be nice if it functioned properly save for a few features: one you cannot map more than one set of of mode shifting to one set of buttons. For example if you want to play an mmo and you use one of the pads for skills, you will only get a set limited amount of functions (four buttons), then mode shift for four more buttons when you could mode shift more but this is not a thing.

Also the worst feature of all time, you cannot press and give an action on the pads of the controller while also pressing the control stick. For example you want to run your character forward while casting a spell, you press forward on the control stick, then press one of the directions on one of the pads to use a skill, this does not work! Instead you have to stop pressing the control stick, then press the pads, then start pressing the control stick again. This is discussing.

I've sent in to Amazon for a replacement, hopefully it gets here soon and I can enjoy a non-broken controller."
1824,2,"Played it for about 4 hours and was thankful that I had just borrowed it and not bought it. The character creation has lots of sliders; however, when your character is covered with clothes where you can barely see their face, the choices in character creation is moot.

As for story, it has about much story as Donkey Kong.

Other reviewers have stated that the intro tutorial could be better, and I agree. Missing one of the tutorial corpse bone note piles puts a player at a learning disadvantage. Thankfully I watched a youtube video to explain some of it.

What made me stop playing was the sheer repetition. Killing the same NPCs over and over to get ""boss"" got boring. Yes, each time I died I did learn what to do, but the repetitivness proved to be its undoing. Speaking of Donkey Kong, players that like the type of games where timing is everything will feel at home with Bloodborne. For those that want a story, best to stick with something like Witcher 3."
1825,2,"I am a father who grew up plaing video games and have owned multiple systems both console and portable. Based on other reviews I read, and the fact that I like Garfield and platform games, I was really excited to give this one a try. Unfortunately my thoughts quickly changed when I started actually playing it.

For a DS game, I thought the graphics were very good. They are colorful and seem much more detailed than many of the other DS titles I've played. In ways that is really good (for this title) but also somewhat depressing considering the level of graphics so many other DS titles COULD have achieved.

This game seems in many ways like it's meant for a younger audience. There are many arrows that direct you to where you need to go and the mini-games seemed very simple in concept (jump on the spiders, or jump on the garbage cans, avoid the bombs that come out and get an extra life). But that's where the irony comes in. For a game that seemed targeted towards younger game players, I thought the difficulty level was pretty high at times. The thing is, the difficulty isn't in areas you would expect but rather the outrageous number of cheap shots you take from enemies/dangers that move/fly/crawl/spring up or shoot you from out of nowhere, many of which you simply don't see until you take a half-blind leap onto a nearby platform, fall from a ledge, or jump somewhere trying to avoid another danger. I was really amazed at the number of cheap shots I was taking as I moved through levels. Whether it was a spiked bomb that suddenly appeared from offscreen as I jumped to reach a ledge, or a snowball that got thrown at me as I was trying to figure out the pattern of a danger I needed to avoid, or an unseen spike that shot up from the ground on a platform I had to jump to. At times it felt like someone meticulously calculated how best to take away hit points and lives for the player, knowing they would jump here to avoid something flying at you and purposely putting something else dangerous there that would be right in sync timewise to hurt you. Throughout the game I constantly felt like I never had enough hit points or lives and was forced to start some whole worlds over repeatedly. I'm starting to wonder if this is simply how this game was designed as a way to try and build in longer playing time for anyone who wants to complete it.

Sadly, some of my biggest frustration seemed to come in during the ""bonus"" levels. You know...the levels that are really hard to find and usually require you to sacrifice a lot of hit points (and lives) to reach because the paths to them are full of danger and enemies. I realized over time that part of the reason I was having to re-play whole lands over again (due to losing all my lives) was this cheap shot mentality that even carried over into the ""bonus rounds"". Without the bonus rounds to rack up extra lives, you have to survive 5 levels (including a boss) with only 3 lives (basicallt 9 hit points). I suppose this is easy enough if you want to go very slowly through the game and sit and wait on every platform ready to jump, because you don't know what might suddenly appear around you from off screen. I was amazed at the number of times I reached a bonus round though, my character appeared on screen, and before I could even move was touched by a spider or something and was instantly killed. So much for the bonus round, the lives/hit points I lost trying to reach it etc... Thus I was actually worse off overall by trying to reach the bonus round than if I had just skipped it altogether.

The real problem with this entire game is that the visual space is simply way too cramped. It makes for a nice large and pretty Garfield, but it also means you are constantly blindsided by things you can't see because the field of vision is way too narrow. I also thought the hit detection on many of the enemies was very poor. Whether jumping on ghosts, birds, snowmen, etc...I was amazed at the number of times I should have defeated an enemy but instead somehow lost one of my few hit points or even lives because jumping on their head wasn't good enough. It was aas if I needed to pinpiont land on one specific pixel that the game randomly decided for each enemy and had apparently chosen the wrong one this time. It was grossly inconsistent and left me scratching my head. In the end I thought the game overall was highly restrictive and punishing in this regard, having an extremely difficult challenge that made you just want to skip trying to jump on enemies after awhile and forget the coins you could have had from destroying them. The funny thing was, I didn't realize until the end that you don't get anything for all the coins you collect. You just need a certain number to open the bonus round doors, but I think the highest number of coins ever needed was 30 or 35, and you can commonly pick up that many just laying around in each level, so there really was no point to ever take on any of the enemies (at least for their coins anyhow).

I really like platform games and have played through many of them on various systems. I have experienced many that were challenging, but Garfields Nightmare turned out to simply be a nightmare in cheap shot gameplay. In the end, my time with this game was more frustration that enjoyment and I would not recommend this game to anyone.

I reached the final boss at about 6 hours of gameplay time and lost 5 lives trying to defeat him. After losing my last life and being told I would have to play the entire world (all five levels) all over again I decided I was simply done with this one."
1826,2,okay
1827,2,"If 2 1/2 stars was an option that would be my rating. I'm a World War 2 buff so I enjoyed the realism and historical basis of this game but overall it's just a basic, decent game to get your shooter fix. It's an older game yet I was still impressed with the graphics and gameplay. My main complaint is that it gets boring. It lacks variety and it didn't grab my interest enough to make me want to play it for very long stretches of time. I was rarely itching to play it the way I've been with other shooters. Of course part of the problem is that I'm used to playing such greats as Bioshock, Halo 3, Gears of War, and COD4. Call of Duty 2 certainly isn't as good as COD4 but I only paid $10 for a brand new copy of this game and at that price or less it's probably worth the money."
1828,2,"Seeing the incredible reviews here I went ahead and bought the game to satisfy my sci-fi gaming urge. I was like the game is older but has great reviews and the screen-shots/videos looked good enough. But I should have listened to my inner voice trying to warn me that there must be a reason that this game never got a expansion or sequel. Even though I got the game at a really low price but after playing it for few days I regret even spending that money. Anyways here is what ails & doesn't ail me;

CONS

1)Repetitious to the nth degree. You do get to visit different worlds but other than a scenery change the missions are the same over & over. You pretty much fly to a way-point; dog-fight with pirates or attack other ships, maybe destroy a space-station sometime, you can also mine or destroy a derelict ship to get upgrades for your vessel but in the end all these missions are just variations of the basic premise of a space-shooter on rails.

2)If you want to be a trader, or pure mine or find some other non-combat way to advance your character that is not really possible. The game is designed in a way that for you to progress beyond star systems you have to complete part of the required story-line as well as have certain threshold of money. That is only possible via doing combat missions of the main plot/side-quests otherwise you will not have enough money or enough progression to move to the next zone. So in all this is at-heart a pure action space rpg.

3) They are also 4-5 npc's at best in the game who you will meet all over the galaxy saying almost the same dialogue and handing you over essentially the same missions just worded differently.

4) Even though you will be visiting different planets, sectors etc. you really can't travel anywhere other than pre-assigned rooms where the above mentioned npc's gives you newer missions making the game feel confined rather than open-world.

PROS

1) Graphics of space-ships, stations, planets etc. are impressive and holds well even to this day.

2) You can upgrade your ship with armaments, equipment or buy better ships over-time which gives a decent rpg feel to the game.

3) The cut-scenes (though repetition abounds here too) helps propel the story and gives the game that quint-essential rpg feel.

In the end this is a ambitiously conceived sci-fi rpg yet a poorly executed game. I actually came here expecting a Eve offline but alas it's more of a action rpg that is designed for people looking for immediate gratification.

EDIT: I got my hands on X3:Terran Conflict and it's the space sim that I have been looking for a long time. If you are looking for a open-ended, single player space simulator rpg with incredible visuals or essentially a Eve Offline than check out Egosoft's X-series games."
1829,2,At first it was great and fun. We had some friends over and were competing. After about 15 minutes it starts to turn into the same thing.
1830,2,"False advertisement, BUYER BEWARE. The stand you receive is not the one advertised in the pictures or the box it comes in. I paid 25 for the stand pictured on the page and when opened, it looks like the cheaper 15-18 dollar variants found on the search page... just with the Ortz logo design slapped in the middle of the stand. Completely unsatisfactory.

Note the design of the USB inserts at the front. The one I (and many others judging from their product pictures) received are rectangle inserts, not oval. The stand is poorly constructed (the plastic on the bottom side caves in if I press on it), feels incredibly cheap, and the fans are loud. There's just 2 small fans... why are they so loud??? I believe they bought a bunch of the cheaper variants and just slapped their logo on the side and resell them @ a higher price. I'm going to keep the one I have since it still does what it needs to do (cools the ps4 & charge the controllers in Rest Mode) and it's too much of a hassle to return.

Do yourself a favor. Save some money and buy one of the 15 dollar ones or buy a different design altogether."
1831,2,"I got these as an inexpensive way to keep my new DSi XL scratch free however this attracted dirt and lint inside my pocket and wasn't the snug fit one would expect when its open (the cover side).

For what it is, its alright though I wouldn't recommend anyone to pick this up if they had the budget for something better."
1832,2,Lame...
1833,2,"Loved it while it worked, which was for about 4 months"
1834,2,"This is the very first Lumines game I've played. I thought I was getting a good deal buying it for less than ten bucks here on Amazon, but the game really sucks. It's a variant on the old Tetris game, except here you're supposed to create 2x2 block squares from the same color (of two colors) so when this vertical time line passes though the block it vanishes. The game is played in landscape mode while the candidate blocks (always 2x2) drop from the ceiling, so you really don't have much time to react. It just plain sucks. And the graphics is so low quality for a Vita game, it's just insulting. I don't care much for the BGM."
1835,2,"This game arrived when amazon told me it would, and it arrived undamaged, I am giving it two stars because it was obviously not ready for a release. There is weird screen tearing and delays in plants and shadows appearing. There is also lots of micro stuttering. I  have this game on PC as well and it has all the same problems, I bought it for the ps4 because I thought it was going to run smoothly, but it didn't. So, go to hell Ubisoft, your company is a joke, and you couldn't make a functioning product if you life depended on it."
1836,2,"Unfortunately this substandard game will go down in history as the piece of software that killed the brokensword franchise. Listing its defects is describing most adventure games these days: badly thought-out puzzles, sleepy progression in the game (zzzz), a hard to follow story, dubious character motivation etc. Nothing wrong with the graphics, game run fine, no bugs that I noticed. Just a massively boring game where you have to force yourself to go ahead. I tried to keep up for a few sessions and eventually capitulated and moved on to a better game (culpa innata)"
1837,2,I didn't really care for this game which is sad because I love Inuyasha.  I much preferred A Feudal Fairy Tale.
1838,2,"Picture wasn't accurate. I received the dorky big forehead version, not the pictured version."
1839,2,I did not enjoy this game. The controls and characters were both really annoying.
1840,2,"unless you just have a zombie fetish and don't own or don't care about the original RDR,you can NOT use any multi-player or single-player content from the add-on packs from this disk(like the tomahawks and explosive rifle or new maps) in the original RDR,just trying to let people know.the Undead Nightmare add-on its self is awesome 5 stars for the DLC content but this disk is very poorly thought out for owners of the original...plus you can get this(undead nightmare collection,which is the exact same thing) from the PlayStation store  for only 20 bucks."
1841,2,"Ok, I get it. Phones and consoles simply don't have the same pricing schemes and what sells for a buck or two on a phone might not sell enough units to make a console port worthwhile unless the price-point is raised. Of course, there are some properties they apparently transcend such conditions and basically believe they have a license to print money. Selling a port of a $1 smartphone game at $20 or even $30 wouldn't have really raised much ire, as that would have put the cost well in the ""budget title"" territory that's traditional for consoles. They would have sold more copies and no one would have really batted an eyelash. By raising the asking price to a full $50 on some platforms, this reeks of a cash grab, and while I know the Star Wars license probably cost a good bit, that didn't make them sell the phone versions for any more than any of the past versions of the game.

If you need to play Angry Birds Star Wars on a console (and there is a place for that...the controls work well with an analog stick), wait for a price drop. There is a place for this, but the ""real world"" price-point should really be closer to $20."
1842,2,"Do not buy, i repeat do not buy unless you want it to break next month. This controller will not last long."
1843,2,"I liked it for a bit. The game voicing is not that good, and the multiplayer is online only, and the servers for the online mode are no longer up."
1844,2,"1. Straight console port.  For example, you have to hold down the right mouse button to aim.  In Crysis 1 you just click the right button once.  It is easy to hold the button of a console controller, but on a PC, holding down the right mouse button while firing is a huge pain.

2. The DirectX 11 fiasco.  Enough has been said about this.

3. The story is messy and difficult to understand.  There is no lasting impression.

4. It is messy, dark, and gloomy.  After playing for a little while you get a headache.

5. Too much influence from Halo and Call of Duty.

Overall I am disappointed.  This game is not junk like most other games, but as a sequel of Crysis 1, I expected it to be much better."
1845,2,"Lousy graphics, dumb story, not very fun at all. However, no freeze-ups or hiccups. I played  it for a while and then just gave up on it. Instead, buy ""Call of Juarez: Bound In Blood"" - now this is a fun, worthwhile game to play."
1846,2,"My daughter loves to create worlds, which the description said she would be able to do with this game.  However, the creation isn't really what we were expecting at all and the game itself seems pointless.  My seven year old daughter absolutely dislikes this game and finds it to be incredibly boring.  Might keep my 3 year old entertained."
1847,2,"Not a good game , very hard to play and no fun and no way to move around.  I don't even have it any more I deleted it..don't waste your money."
1848,2,"Many have already written on this game, so I'll try to avoid repeating what they've said, but ultimately, this game starts out strong and entertaining enough, but settles into a middle-ground groove that's neither bad, nor great, but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on.
The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable, but not too convincing -- you can tell it's not Harrison Ford.
And unsurprisingly, it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end, Indiana gets the Asian (i.e. Chinese) girl, even though there's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with.
The ending is dull -- both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran, swung, punched and kicked your way through level after level, trap after trap.
Good if you're an Indiana Jones fan, but others should either rent or stay away altogether."
1849,2,I probably should have read more about this game before I bought it. Its like Grand Theft Auto of the West. I am not a fan of Grand Theft Auto type games.  Wouldn't recommend to those who share this opinion.
1850,2,Terrible port.
1851,2,"The hope is obvious here. You buy these thinking, ""maybe I found a controller that matches the quality of a standard xbox controller microsoft makes"", and it comes so close it's almost angering that they're not. The problem is the sticks. They're too sensitive here, dead there, and it creates a very jerky experience that really makes me want to put the game down for the day after about 5 minutes. I did wind up buying standard xbox controllers, which work flawlessly of course.

I don't recommend these, and I really am the type that doesn't get wrapped up in brand names. I bought 2, and they're nearly identical in their issues. I suppose these problems may not bother some people, but the reality is they're not good controllers. They're mediocre at best, and may suffice for beat em ups, but anyone looking at the gigantic arena of xbox shooters, this is a no go. Go authentic, or try someone else's knock off, because this one is not the jack pot. It's a pot hole in the journey to a less expensive solution to a worthwhile controller."
1852,2,"I got these for free, with the purchase of a PS4.  Now I see why they tossed them in for free.  The bar that goes over your head just snapped the other day w/ a minimal amount of pressure.  I have a Tritton headset that I have had for about 8 years, and nothing like this ever happened with them.  The other gripe that I had with these headphones was that they are uncomfortable if worn longer than a half hour.  You can adjust them all you want, but the fabric will just heat up your ears and irritate them to no end.

Of course they are great to own as a freebie, but don't waste your money buying them."
1853,2,"I got this at gamestop used to try & luckily I did. I got it becaue the videos on youtube showd some great moves in the dance section & that it had yoga. I read here it doesn't use the camera & doesn't track your moves which is weird for a game.
Upon trying it out, I never realized how eird it seemed to play a game with no tracking. The animation is bad, it makes following the dancing & yoga too stiff & boring. I was expecting the dancing to go slow at first to teach you the moves, but not here! Nope, full speed, too bad if you can't keep up & I have done many dance dvds & LOVE Dance Central.

To me, this is shovelware. Why bother if it doesn't track you & the music & animations are boring & worse then any other workout dvd?
Try checking videos of the gameplay, what you see, is what you get."
1854,2,"WW2 themed games are in no short supply these days, and the same goes for stealth games.  So it was only a matter of time before someone thought to combine the two - the result is, of course, DEATH TO SPIES.

The game is hard to follow from the get-go - after a forced training session, you are introduced to the ""story"" which seems to involve you either being debriefed or interrogated about former missions.  You are a spy of some kind, going behind enemy lines in WW2 era Germany to achieve various objectives.

Each level starts you out with a kit of weapons of your own choosing (you can also let the game choose a default starting kit each level).  On each level, you will sneak by enemies to reach an objective, such as a document that needs retrieving, or a prisoner that needs liberating.  You can sneak past guards, or you can overwhelm one and change clothes with him, allowing you to walk right past many of the guards undetected.  You have a standard array of WW2 era weapons - machine guns, grenades, and pistols.  You also have a silenced pistol, which you can use to take out guards without drawing unwanted attention.  Also at your disposal is chloraform and choke wire, with which you can also silently dispose of pesky guards.  The graphics are nice enough, employing the bloom effect that has become popular of late, giving the game a look very reminiscent of BROTHERS IN ARM.

The first couple of levels proceed decently enough, but by the third level I was growing tired of the same basic gameplay and the infuriating controls.  This game is MURDER when it comes to controlling our man.  For starters, you are meant to sneak up on guards and take them down silently - but to do so, you must hit a particular button to go into sneak mode, rather than just holding shift as other games might allow you to do.  Then you must hope your crawling pace will get you to said guard before he decides to turn, to start walking again, or someone else comes into view.  And when you have to subdue a guard in motion, forget about it!

When you do manage to get up to an unsuspecting guard, you can't just hit one button to punch him - you have to hit the action button, which then brings up a menu, from which you have to scroll down to the action you want to take (in this case, stun) and then hit action again!  This is crazy - most of the time, you are trying to hit the guard who has heard you and is starting to turn - the extra two seconds it takes to scroll through the menu means he will complete the turn and spot you.  WHO THOUGHT OF THIS CONTROL SCHEME!  The same problem happens with opening doors.  Go up to the door, press action, select OPEN DOOR, press action again.  By then, the guards you were trying to slip by have turned the corner and seen you!

Once you are spotted, you might as well reload - two shots and you're dead.  Or, which is more often the case, the guards will throw a grenade at you - and they NEVER miss with the grenades!

In the outdoor missions, these problems aren't as pronounced, because you can usually take the guards on one by one.  But indoors is a different story - the guards will be in groups of five or more, so getting them alone is out of the question. Lob a grenade and they will scatter without taking any damage - and then sound the alarm which doubles the guards!

So eventually, you learn the only way to get through a level is to use the silenced pistol and kill from a distance.  Even then, another guard will inevitably see the fallen body and come running.  Most of the time, even if they are running straight at you, they will always stop and look at the body for a second first, which gives you time to try to pop them in the head as well.  On the first level, I took out 7 guards in one spot with this method - YAWN, what fun!

Of course, you have nowhere near enough silenced bullets to take down every guard, and again, indoors they are too tightly packed to use it anyway.  So, ultimately, I'd had enough and stopped playing on the third level.

With more user-friendly controls and a better ability to camoflauge yourself, this might have been a fun game.  But as it is, I can't recommend it at all!"
1855,2,"Having read all the negative reviews I didn't want to buy this disaster. Fortunately I had a BB gift card so I pulled the trigger hoping I'd beat the odds. I didn't . MONTHS after its release, it's still buggy.

CAMPAIGN
I always play the campaigns and enjoy them. This one seemed pretty short. But I'll never know because as I neared the end of the story my campaign progress was RESET out of nowhere. Having spent hours trying to beat my friend's scores. They're all gone now. I'm pissed.

MULTIPLAYER
Server filtering is actually pretty good. Until you want to enter a game. The player count on the servers are very lagged and are never accurate. When I get past the queue and start loading, the game will either kick me out because it's ""lost connection"" or the game will crash. What?!"
1856,2,Was not very happy that the game was super super scratched up!!!
1857,2,"It's a cover shooter. Have you ever played one of those? then you've played this game. There's nothing different and certainly nothing better in this game than any other cover shooter ever made. You grab some cover, you pop out and shoot people, that's it. Now, I've got nothing against games that use cover shooter mechanics (see Mass Effect 2 for a great game in that vein) but you've got to give us more in this day and age.

Let me sum this game up for you:

Cut scene, kill everyone in the room, advance to next area. Cut scene, kill everyone in the room, advance to next area. Cut scene, kill everyone in the room, advance to next area. Repeat until bored.
There is no variation whatsoever. There are no problems to be solved and no decisions to be made, just cut scene, kill everyone in the room, advance to the next area. That's all this game is from start to finish.

I added the extra star because the graphics are nice and the bloodshed is bountiful but it's not enough to save this boring, repetitive and mediocre cover shooter.

It's too bad, the name Max Payne used to mean something."
1858,2,"Bad connectivity, not a good feel, feels cheap, don't like this mouse."
1859,2,"Overall, this was a below average game.  It uses very dated technology.  For example, the characters move their mouths while the text of what they are saying appears at the bottom.  There is no voice acting.  You have to wait until their mouths stop moving before you can click the mouse and move forward.  I also found the inventory tool to be very problematic.  There were several points in the game where the window would collapse before I could grab the item.  There are also problems with the setting of the story.  We start out on a train in the American West somewhere and end up in a far away ancient land...No portals, just a bridge to get us there.  If you want a game with rich characters, a good story line and a nice user interface, skip this one."
1860,2,"I've been a Blizzard fan ever since the days of Warcraft 2.  Few companies have delivered quality games with such consistency as Blizzard has.  Sadly, that trend of quality seems to have waned in recent years, particularly since Blizzard's merger with Activision in 2008.  The focus shifted away from delivering the highest possible quality of product, and toward milking as much money as possible out of these games.  It began with World of Warcraft, and the overhauls in the game intended to add as many paying subscribers as possible, while leaving the longtime players hanging out to dry.  Then it became the sale of in-game vanity items for real cash, in a game that already charges $40 for an expansion every 2 years on top of the existing $15 monthly fee.

In Starcraft 2, there was surprisingly very little milking of the product on the surface.  This is likely due to the fact that this is the eSports poster child for Blizzard, and there's just not that much to sell cosmetically in a RTS.  However, they did plan for 2 expansions right off of the bat, and there is talk of selling custom maps for real money in the future.  But for the most part, Starcraft 2 is actually a quality title, and one that I will continue to play and enjoy.

Sadly, the same amount of time and effort put into Starcraft 2 was not made here.  Diablo 3, while pretty, is not a very deep or complex game.  It is mostly a spammable clickfest, where you occasionally get a shiny item that may or may not be useful to you.  Strategy is limited to ""stay out of the glowing stuff, click the bad guy until he falls over"".  You beat the game in about 6 hours, at which point you're invited to play the exact same game through a second time, and then a third time, and then a fourth time.  That's the extent of replayability in this game.  Play the exact same 6 hour stretch of content over and over and over again, just hoping that the right shiny thing drops for you.

One addition of controversy in this game is the ""Real Money Auction House"", where players are able to buy and sell the shiny things they find in the game for actual money.  Blizzard claims this is to reduce illegitimate items sales and gold farming, in reality, it's just another money grab for them.  If you want to know why, look no further than the selling fees.  You lose 15% any time you sell and item, and you lose another 15% every time you try to actually to redeem the money that you've earned.  You lose a whopping 30% on the sale of a digital item.  That's absolute insanity, and the result is that it drives up prices, making the illegitimate ""black market"" sellers all the more appealing.

And of course, there's the issue of servers.  You're forced to play on Blizzard's servers, which have had an embarrassingly high amount of downtime thus far.  Clearly Blizzard wasn't prepared for this.

Needless to say, I've found myself rather bored of this game already.  There's very little incentive to continue playing it aside from the chance to try and make some money on the auction house.  There's not any significant content on the horizon other than the PvP patch (which will get old very quickly), there's no custom user-created content like Starcraft 2 has either (which isn't necessary under normal circumstances, but when there's this little content to the game, it absolutely is necessary).  I will consider my lesson learned for this game, and will eagerly be looking forward to the release of Guild Wars 2 instead.  For those lifetime Blizzard fans like me that are still clinging onto hope, know that the Blizzard you once loved is all but dead now.  Move on."
1861,2,"This is my third Razer mouse although they make great mice, however i cant say the same about their reliability, these should be higher end for the price they're sold, but unfortunately they don't last long, well not as long as Logitech mice did, almost 8 months of use will start the famous double click problem with probably any Razer mouse, its all over youtube, i wish Razer would work more on the quality and reliability of their products instaed of the huge marketing campaigns they run, i cant say that am ever buying Razer products anymore, not for my self and not for my customers, although all my gaming gear is from them and almost all my shelfs have their products listed, i will surely move to a better company, maybe back to Logitech"
1862,2,"Vanquish skirts that line of decent so finely that I had to think long and hard about that star rating up there. Since the game shares many similarities to other modern third-person shooters, your enjoyment of it hinges on what you're looking for in a shooter. So, to start this review off right, I should come out and say it;

I wasn't a big fan of Gears of War. I thought the technology on display was impressive, but the game had a sort of sluggish pace that didn't lend itself to a shooter, an extremely weak story coupled with uninspired villains, and a general lack of creativity. Vanquish, it seems to me, is the uneasy marriage of the Gears of War model and a fast-paced sci-fi action game, which doesn't exactly gel.

You play as Sam Gideon- what happened to game names?- an utterly generic future power-armor space marine assigned to... do something with the help of Robert Burns, a Gears of War reject, complete with a gigantic minigun. They're fighting robots, an invading force attempting to take over what I assume to be Earth. I'm a little hazy on the plot; the opening scenes did not paint a great picture, and it wasn't long before I was skipping cutscenes just so I wouldn't have to hear these people talk.
On a quick side note, I'm curious as to why games like this feel the need to have a story at all; remember the days of Sonic the Hedgehog, and Mario, when games didn't really need stories? It seems to me that if you don't have an original story to tell, just focus your millions of dollars on making a game that's fun to play instead of interrupting gameplay every 10 minutes to tell us more about the robots and their nefarious plan to... do something.

The features that Vanquish claims as unique gameplay are twofold; first, Sam can enter ""Augmented reality mode,"" which temporarily slows down time in order to give the player a short period of uninterrupted shooting. Apparently no one told lead developer Shinji Mikami that the heyday of Bullet Time was around ten years ago. The mechanic isn't original, but it does work well, especially during boss battles.

Second, Sam's suit has a sliding dash feature that allows you to close the distance between you and the enemy extremely quickly. I can imagine this mechanic working well in an action game, like, say, God of War, but the strange thing is that Vanquish didn't seem to be designed with it in mind; most of the time, dashing up to an enemy means attempting a melee attack, which automatically overheats your suit, making a quick getaway using the dash impossible until you hide behind a bit of rubble for several seconds, which breaks the flow in what comes billed as a fast-paced action game. We have instead a game not designed for close-range combat coupled with a mechanic that demands it.

In general, it seems that the gameplay was designed by someone attempting to imitate Gears of War while attempting to meld in elements which would work better without the Gears of War model. It's a strange hybrid.

On the side of good, Vanquish does not share Gears' problem of muddy graphics. It looks just as good, for the record, but it contains bright colors and character design other than gigantic fat people (other than Burns), which I like. The environments sport impressive detail, even from a distance, too. Vanquish also sports some really nice boss battles, the first against a transforming spider robot being a high point in the game. I wish they happened more often, but an advantage over Gears of War in this regard is pretty nice.

The points I haven't touched yet are the nails in the coffin for me, however. Vanquish doesn't contain a multiplayer mode, which will irk some, but it seems like it was designed to; the only weapons worth a damn are the generic ones. While the game sports several original weapons, like a disk launcher and a lock-on laser, they shrink in comparison to the big five of every shooter; the assault rifle, the heavy machine gun, the shotgun, the rocket launcher, and the sniper rifle.  I found exactly one situation in which I didn't have some combination of these, and the rest of the weapons, such as the disk launcher and the LFE gun, are severely underpowered. You're better off using the same guns you find in every shooter. Mikami had a great futuristic setting in which to premier new guns, and wasn't tied down to having to balance them for a multiplayer setting; why not give us something a little more interesting?

Beyond that, the enemy variety is pretty paltry; you fight wave after wave of the generic shock troops, then the two kinds of heavy, then the tank. Another strange thing is that the larger battles don't feel as if you're having any effect; I'm not sure why the designers saw the need to give you a team of inferior soldiers to follow you around all the time, but they're there. About halfway through the game, you have to take on a spaceship on your own, and I felt that this section does a great job at showing off what the game could have been, had it been designed entirely around its mechanics instead of with Gears of War constantly in the rearview mirror.

And that's the major problem with Vanquish; it's pulling itself in one direction with its two innovations while steadfastly sticking its shoes in the mud with its devotion to formula. I can't recommend it, but if you're a fan of Gears of War desperately in need of an adrenaline rush, you might have a better time with it."
1863,2,My slut gf replays the blowjob mission now I hate this game lol
1864,2,"cool keyboard that's for sure!
didn't like the feel of it

returned"
1865,2,"This game is great for the campaign, but not so much for multiplayer.  Since it's the multiplayer option that I bought it for, I would call this game disappointing.  I really don't like shooting at targets jumping around on Pogo sticks.  That's essentially what it is.  Everyone jumping around all over the place at high speed makes it difficult to hit anything.  If being a sniper is your thing, you are in for a rough time.  With this gameplay it's makes no sense to have sniper rifles at all.  Which brings me to my next point, the guns.  Most of them look really cool, but too many are impractical and just aren't very impressive.  The sound effects are weak so you get a lot of them sounding like pop guns.  Then you get nonsense like the 20mm Atlas rifle.  A big bazooka sized sniper rifle that is heavy and slow to aim.  Then it makes a weak ""pop"" sound when you shoot it.  LOL.  Jeez, if you are going to give me this massive impractical gun that has no business being in this game, then at least have it do something cool.  There's another lame rifle that takes two shots to use it properly.  The first round is a sensor, the second explodes it.  It's a pretty neat effect, assuming you will even get the second shot.  My next beef with the multiplayer is the redeemable loot.  When I play a game like this, I don't want to spend a bunch of my time doing maintenance.  That's what you get with redeemable loot.  Throughout the game you will be given ""supply drops"".  This gives you ""loot"" in the form of gear, weapons, etc.  The problem is they give you a ton of duplicates.  Since you have a limited number of slots, you will be forced to go through pages and pages of stuff to delete them.  If you don't, you won't be able to get anymore.  Amidst the large numbers of useless items, you will get the occasional elite item,  so you will be forced to comply.  Not my idea of fun.  I'm sure the game designers are counting on you buying more slots.  My next issue is with lagging.  This game lags so badly at times that it's unplayable.  We're not just talking about during a battle.  Oh, no, this junk lags even in the menus in the freaking game lobby.  Are you kidding me?  That's just inexcusable to me. No other game I have does this.  Then you have your standard multiplayer frustrations which are pretty much a COD staple.  Each game is a box of chocolates.  Sometimes the game will serve you up to the enemy on a silver platter, through horrible spawn points and connection delays.  Other times the game will spawn you out in the north 40 and you will spend more time running than shooting.  Sometimes your guns will work great, other times they wont.  Sometimes you won't have a chance because the other players will see you way before you see them.  Other times, you will get that benefit.  It's a mixed bag, which usually ends in frustration.  Last on my list of negatives are the sound effects.  Yuck.  Most of the guns sound like pop guns, the explosions sound awful, and the exo suits sound like an air compressor.  Now, it's not all bad.  The campaign was amazing and the graphics are out of this world.  The zombie mode isn't too bad, but I just can't buy into the zombie's in exo suits.  The game does give you a lot of stuff for your money, it just could have been done better."
1866,2,"Being an old time PnP D&D player, I got the gold edition to dive into some good old fashioned D&D gameplay.

Deeply disappointed. I wish I could say something really good about the game, honestly.

1. No die rolls (something so v-e-r-y D&D, that even Icewind Dale had).
2. Character models are pretty bland (and the models appear more like you expect from the modding community, than a commercial venture, not even 2003ish in appearance. My character's mouth will sparkle white not due to teeth, but bad UV mapping of the texture [exposing the non UV base model underneath]).
3. Haven't seen this many reloads since the first console to PC conversion (and each one requires unloading and reloading at least 2 modules, to over 19. Even if you have a super rig that decked out, the reloads are going to annoy you to no end -- every door you enter [and make sure to click twice to even open it], included).

The first irritation to this day with the 1.21 patch -- January 4, 2009 -- will be the camera. This isn't any camera setup you've seen before in any RPG/MMO/FPS game, and 99% of players will want to change it straight at the beginning (you will need MotB installed to ""fix"" a part of the camera issues, but others still remain with even the newest SoZ expansion). Words can't describe how awful it is, nor how you're faced with 3 camera modes (MotB) and each has their separate options to fumble with. Once you experienced it you'll check any future game to ensure never to encounter it again! Seriously.

NW2, even with patches it's enough to want to pull your teeth out -- I played it for a couple hours and couldn't take it anymore [upto the fort, and that jealous female companion literally from hell, who's worse than a backseat driver her dialogue resembles).

If you're the type of RPG gamer who is picky about your party and it's alignment (playing lawful good/lawful evil characters), the game will force companions on you, which can be a polar (and polarizing) alignment. Their dialogue can also make you sour of having them around (but you need them to complete quests).

MotB, is a game you will want to look up ingame cheat codes to turn off the v-e-r-y annoying type of count down meter. When you need to rest, and it's at like 15, you will die unless you become a type of vampire (and from experience the ""drink"" doesn't offer enough ""blood"" to raise the meter enough if it gets low unless you ""graze"" [which becomes a grinder]). Otherwise, you can convert XP to ""blood"" to drink, which means it'll take you longer to level (and this is a shorter expansion). Players will also fight with their bare-fist despite having a weapon, since the AI isn't even intelligent enough to switch weapons in your inventory to use. This game has some serious, and I mean, s-e-r-i-o-u-s AI issues, and your fix is a third party mod (yes, player made -- that the devs even used in SoZ but took out some features, which caused more bugs!!).

Do I need to even to continue this black comedy further???

The numerous bugs, still to this day not fixed with all those patches (and all expansions, as the new trend of patching games is to buy the newest expansion to fix older bugs), is the real problem with the game. Some aren't very game breaking, but even the minor ones cause CTD, and reflects the overall polish of the game in general. NW2+MotB strives to be an AAA title, but you get the feeling from everything from the animations to the dialogue, it's a AA title, instead. It's a step above the best mods in gaming, but definitely not Oblivion/Morrowind in production values.

YMMV, but I'm getting quite dishearten of games of late. If they're not released as buggy betas; promising what they can't deliver; the want to continue buying the franchise is cheapen by what the official forum communities attract for help on game issues (soap opera driven juvenile delinquents [including the forum staff]-- gone are the days of just dealing with 15 year-olds that would make a sailor proud).

I won't be buying another game from this publisher/dev duo due to all of this. Maybe in 5+ years, and after both review their Q&A I'll reconsider, but for now NW2 Gold has been a waste of money."
1867,2,"As a PC port, this game fails on a technical level due to ugly textures. It will make anyone sad to see how little the distributor cared for giving us a PC version as this really looks like a rushed job. Whats even sadder is that even if the graphics were on par with the console versions, the game would still fall flat. Regardless of what version you are playing, you will be given a very lackluster game which tried to be so much more than the sum of its parts, but falls flat. This is a mission based shooter where you are given a quest, and must ride your vehicle to the right base and shoot everyone in your way to complete it. You slowly upgrade your load out to be better at completing these quests. It is the same thing all the time though and because there is very little overarching story, you never feel compelled to do as you are told and carry out whatever you must do. It is not much of an open world either, so its not like you can ignore the quests you don't like and play as you wish at your own rhythm. The fact that there is little freedom and yet asks that you travel from every mission back to a base kills any momentum and pacing the story may have. This would have worked much better as a linear corridor shooter (like Bulletstorm) or a truly open world shooter/RPG (like Borderlands) but instead we have something attempting to be a bit of both yet lacks the strengths of either. Imagine a less open Borderlands 2 with much less class, character and load out customization with no world map and devoid of humour or personality and you get Rage. And if you are playing on PC then add horrid texture pop in issues to that.
I will give it one thing though, this is the best AI I ever faced this side of Binary Domain. I was very impressed with how aware the enemy AI was of my tactics and their reactions to my actions (like dodging or ducking when they see me aim or raise my weapon). I would have loved to face this AI in a better game."
1868,2,"Alone in the Dark was the first game I ever pre-ordered. I was extremely excited to play another ""Resident Evil"" style game with next gen physics, graphics and gameplay... I should have waited.

Alone in the Dark starts with a bang, introducing some very impressive cutscene work and EXCELLENT graphics and music. The voice acting is only decent, but the script makes up for it... Anyhow, once the game starts, things take an abrupt turn for the worse. My first thoughts were, ""What the heck? This thing wasn't even made for Xbox!"" The controls are simply awful, the fighting is very awkward, and the objectives get repetitive. The last time I experienced a game this annoying was ""Advanced Warfighter"" on the PS2.

Don't buy this game!

1870,2,"As many video gamers can attest, all the way back to the horrible abomination that was E.T for the Atari 2600 (given only a 6 week window to program, it was certain this game would fail, and indeed around 2M are rumored to have been buried in a US desert), movie video games typically aren't very good.

This is also one of those games.

Admittingly, I was looking for some cheaper games at first for my PS3, and I would probably never have bought this game otherwise.  Still I wanted to give it a try.

The graphics/cutscenes are the best part of this game, as they should be on a PS3 system.  The gameplay pretty much borrows from its predecessors (complete puzzle, having to use a specific character, complete specific tasks, mash this button, etc).  You can find many other games (the Ratchet and Clank series, for one) that does what Prince Caspian tries to do much, much better.

Graphics:  9/10  You'll definitely feel like you're in the movie with the graphics, for better or worse

Sound:  7/10  Standard fare for a game of this type; nothing memorable

Gameplay:  2/10  Pretty much the same thing you've seen 1000's of times before

Replay Value:  1/10  Not too many reasons to play this game again after you've beaten it.

So, if you're a huge Prince Caspian/Narnia fan, you will probably love the game.  Otherwise, you'd be best to take your $10-15 down to a Game Stop and find a different game."
1871,2,"Ugh.  This game is a chore to play. Arkham City built upon the great Arkham Asylum, offering great combat, some nice stealth moves, liberal and creative use of ""detective mode,"" an awesome storyline, and a dark and foreboding setting.  Arkham Knight gives us fantastically rich and detailed graphics, a combat system that remains essentially the same but offers some great new moves, and a sandbox Gotham that theoretically allows you to explore the city.  What could go wrong?

The Batmobile, that's what.  It's terribly implemented.  It wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't require you to use it.  For example, early in the game you are required to bust into a chemical plant and take out the bad guys.  In the previous two games, you would batclaw up to the roof, find an entry point, and sneakily make your way through the ductwork, etc. to take out the thugs.  In Arkham Knight, you have to find a way to get the Batmobile up a series of ramps and over obstacles so that you can use it to take out some drone tanks before you power an out-of-order elevator so you can get into the building.  Once that is all done, you just end up blasting a hole in the brick wall that was, very mysteriously, impervious to the Batmobile's missile attacks just minutes earlier.  Then, as you head out, you have to drive the Batmobile onto a lift, get out of the car and walk a few feet to the switch, move the elevator up, walk back over to the car and climb a short wall, and get back into the Batmobile.  It's so incredibly stupid that it yanks you out of the storyline repeatedly.  In the old games you would just Batclaw and soar across the skyline; in the new game you have to drive this huge, hulking Batmobile through streets way too narrow for it.

As if that wasn't bad enough, the slow of the gameplay and storyline are constantly interrupted with these stupid ""take out the drone tank"" mini-games.  They aren't difficult, but they take upwards of several minutes to complete (and some much longer than that) and are a huge and annoying hindrance.

If Rocksteady wanted to make the Batmobile such a central part of the game, it should have been a separate game or perhaps DLC content.  As it is, forcing players to drag along the stupid car everywhere they go makes the game tedious and annoying.  In the previous two games, I quickly got sucked in and would play for hours at a time without even realizing how much time had passed.  With Arkham Knight, the Batmobile alone makes me painfully aware of how much time I am wasting playing this stupid game, not to mention the silly and hamfisted storyline.

Overall, I found Arkham Knight to be a tragic ending to an otherwise amazing game series.  Play if if you like playing driving/tank games or if you just want to finish it for the sake of completion.  Otherwise, skip it."
1872,2,"this is a pretty good game, however it is pretty repeditive... there is not much to it, no campaign, and the single player game play is all the same thing... though it is fun the first few times you play."
1873,2,"A younger family member got this game a couple days ago. I figured it would be nice to try it out since I like the cartoon and the fact the game has a co-operative option. My nephew thought it was better than all of the better past gen beat em ups (Final Fight, Streets of Rage), but I thought this game was a TOTAL bore.

*This review is based on a two level playthrough*

Graphics weren't necessarily bad, but they were a little dull. Things were crisp and smooth looking, but I felt like the game could've had more visually happening on screen than it did. For example, when you used superpowers as one of the omnitrix creatures, there wasn't really anything overly flashy done on-screen.

Some of the pluses. It's nice that you could unlock new combos and moves as you progress. In addition, it was also a cool feature that a second player could drop in and out of the game at any point in time(which I did a lot in disgust as I played). You can also unlock other things like concept art as well being able to transform into some of the omnitrix monsters.

Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't a saving grace. In beat em up games, I like to be able to both hear and feel the power behind every hit I deal to somebody, but in this game, that facet isn't there. You just constantly wail and wail and wail on an enemy and as you do it, there's no real feedback from what you're doing. There's no ""oof!"" sounds or overly done punching noises that engage you in the fight and drive you to want to beat up more baddies. Instead, all they have are these barely audible sounds that resemble sounds of rain hitting windows.

Also, you can pull off ""combos"" in this game, but that's not to interesting or challenging to do either. It's just circle, circle, circle, circlex5(8 hit combo!) but there's nothing remarkable happening on-screen. All you see is your character constantly doing the same punch or kick animation until the baddie dies; they don't block (which they can do), or reverse what you're doing, but instead just sit there and take EVERY punch. Gosh, I think I had a 25 hit combo at one point, but I just didn't CARE.

Fighting with the omnitrix monsters isn't to exciting either. It's easy enough to transform, but when you do, it's really underwhelming. Like, you can do superpowers and everything with them, but it doesn't seem like what you do as an omnitrix monster is any more effective than Ben in his normal form. You're just wailing and wailing and wailing and wailing and wailing with superpowers and punches until these guys FINALLY decide to drop down.

One other annoying thing is the odd warping. It just feels so sudden and weird when you're both playing and you both keep warping all over the place as you approach new areas.

Enemy types seem a little limited to. I would assume there will be more types of enemies further in the game, but the first two levels had all of the same types: FREAKING NINJAS. Some might've had nunchucks and some might've had swords, but it was ALL I SAW. Geez, I was more annoyed than excited every time these ninjas appeared to fight with me. It was like, "" I finally dropped them all!^_^"" (more spawn) ""ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh arghhhhhhhhh!""

The game is unbelievably easy to. I was playing it on the hardest difficulty and the game was a stinking cakewalk. Practically every area you enter has loads of health and dying isn't even a problem in the least. Gosh, I know this game is for kids and all but man, at least challenge these kids a LITTLE!

That's it! This game should've been released as one of those free games on the CN website to promote the show; it just has that ""waste a couple minutes playing this game at your job to pass some time"" feel.

Ugh...I gave this game 2 stars simply not because it's broken, but mainly because it's soooo unfun. It's unfortunate all the better beat em ups on the PS2 are a little to mature for a younger audience, but please....do not buy your kids this trash."
1874,2,"It is just incredible to see how the series that created the genre has been destroyed by the las installment.

The game is full of technical problems that prevent you from having any fun whatsoever. It had a super great potential but they blew it by releasing too early and not paying attention to the actual game play.

Graphics are very good but that does not save a game at all. This is the only reason it got 2 stars, to tell the artists that they are the only ones who did a good job.

This only tells you the state of the Video Game industry. These guys have almost no process in their development cycle and whatever little process they have it is done wrong. It is very possible that they put the developers to work 60+ hours a week just as they did to us in EA for Superman, which was another disappointment, though not even close to the level of failure this game is.

As for the game, well, simply don't buy it, it is going to be a real disappointment and a waste of your money. In spite of the industry being in complete development dippers, some companies still manage to crate good games, this unfortunately is not one of them. Rent it if you want to see it, just as I did after reading the reviews here and I am glad to have wasted only $5 instead of $60.

You have been warned."
1875,2,"I'm just gonna say it plan and simple , This Game suckssssss. I was excited for this game I preorder and waited at the door for the ups man. After about 2 weeks I send it back to Amazon and got trade in credit .I get that on releases day there are just bugs wither  servers and lag. But come now now after 2 weeks you should have it fixed. Some might say they got no lag. I play COD, BF2 and Halo and I have no lag.

Story Mode
Whats story mode the game mp is the story mode. You get some crappy cut scene and then your off to do the next thing.

This game would of been fun it if worked."
1876,2,"I was so excited for this game and now I feel let down. This game literally had me wanting to throw my controller through my TV half the time. Wet is the story of a problem fixer named ruby voiced nicely by Eliza Dushku. She takes jobs to eliminate targets and get caught in a war between two drug lords. The characters and art styles of the game were interesting this game reminded me of Max Payne. The problem is Max Payne was better and it came out what 8 years ago. The aiming for this shooter is a bit dated what saves it is that when you jump slide or shoot time is slowed down and ruby always lock on one target with her duel weapons allowing you to mow down enemies. In fact if you aren't jumping or sliding or something you'll be dead soon. This works fine in combat and its fun. However the numerous bugs and glitches wear your patience thin by the 3rd level and things keep sliding down from there. I died a ton of times trying to jump from ledges due to poor camera and touchy controls. There were numerous sequences that really pissed me off. First there was this spot where you fell from a plane that must have took me about an hour and half to master. Then there was an area were you had to slide under a door and shoot 2 locks on each side to progress the auto aim is random and I found this task to be harder than it should have. The game is very fast paced and has a nice style its too bad they were so sloppy with its design. My advice is to pass or rent it. Don't buy it though, it's short and frustrating as hell."
1877,2,"Luckily, I rented this before deciding whether or not to buy.  And boy am I lucky that I tried it before dropping $50 for it.
Well, everyone knows about the concept and cool graphics and all.  The game suffered no slow down even with multi-tap on.  But after playing for a short time, I realized how bad this game is.  The controls are difficult, the power-ups are useless in a race (you need to use shortcuts to win).  And worse, the carts move way too slow.  The fun of any cart racing (ala Mario Kart or even Rumble Racing ) is that it's fast.  This game felt like I was moving at snail pace.
I wish that they would put Mario Kart on PS2 (though never happen) or someone come up with a true kart game.  The closest out right now is Rumble Racing which is definitely worth the look if you're looking for cart racing type game."
1878,2,No real purpose for this cord except that it is heavier duty version of the cord that comes with the Wii. Doesn't improve resolution at all.
1879,2,"I'm maybe halfway through this game, and it has crashed at least twice.  Because of the checkpoint system for saving the game (the game saves when it wants to), I can't save when I want to.  What happens when the game crashes?  I lose, and have to restart back at the last checkpoint.  Bad, bad, bad.

I have the latest updates from Steam, but the game still crashes.

The graphics, game play, and controls are okay.  The checkpoint system makes this game frustrating.  If you get defeated, go back to the last checkpoint.  If the game crashes, go back to the last checkpoint.

Had I known this was a checkpoint game, I would not have bought it.  This is a Steam game, so once you play it, you can not resell it.

In the single player campaign, some of the boss fights are very difficult...they do not scale with the difficulty you choose (I was playing on ""normal"" and tried ""easy"").  And there are about 4 bosses that don't die; when you almost destroy them, then they come back to life and fly away (and you get to fight them again later).  Silly and frustrating.

The female soldier and the female mercenaries are annoying and immature.  At least half of the script is cliched and cheesy.

There are 5 ""acts"" or levels.  At act 4, I stopped playing.  In the ""Defense of Constantine"" scene, I couldn't beat Cornelius (one of the ""bosses"").  It got to the point where it was not fun anymore...just frustrating.

The second being tracking is pretty garbage which you can really tell while you play games, otherwise it works for everyday computing purposes. To bad its over priced.

1881,2,"The Good: Huge bosses, decent graphics, cool enemies, decent story

The Bad: Terrible level design, extremely difficult, lame weapons, weapons are never powerful enough, retarded healing system, story isn't done justice, there's going to be a sequel...

Legendary is yet another game this year that has been released and has totally let all of us FPS fans down, but what a surprise right? FPS games are probably the most prone to failing terribly due to lazy level design, bad story, bad physics and anything else you put in an FPS. Unfortunately, Legendary does almost everything wrong and hardly anything right, but you can still squeeze a few drops of fun out of this weekend rental. Legendary puts you up against Pandora's Box's creatures that starts taking over and destroying the world while trying to be controlled by the evil LeFey.

While the plot sounds semi-interesting it takes a face dive right into a mud pit once you start playing since you don't really give a crap after about thirty minutes. If playing the game is hard enough as it is the mechanics the game is built around are totally slapped together and not very well done. Even when I saw videos of this game I knew it didn't look complete and they actually shipped the game unfinished. First and foremost, the main culprit is the Unreal 3 engine. Now I'm not bashing the engine at all its just many developers tend to think U3 will MAKE the game for them and they just have to tell it what to do and that is not the case. There are a lot of similarities to BioShock, in fact, from the Animus powers shooting out of your hand (with almost exact animations), to the same glowy look on everything you interact with. While the game looks half way decent everything looks like it was copied and pasted into the game instead of built there. You're wondering around a war torn London and New York and you don't even feel like you're there since the game doesn't replicate the cities at all not even famous landscapes for Christ sake! On top of this the physics are way off and everything seems to stick like glue or something and it's just really weird. There's terrible collision detection to where enemies will go through walls and stick there and start flopping around like some kid with Down Syndrome.

This is also coupled with cramped levels, linear levels, and everything just looks the same. Turn this wheel here, kill these creatures here, shoot these wire suspensions here, bypass this keypad here. The game is very tedious and just completely retarded and put together so poorly. Even moving your character is even a pain since when you get hit on one side you stop moving that way for some strange reason and I have no idea why. You'll be strafing left and then get attacked by your left, but you just stop dead in your tracks and you have to jam the stick left a few times before even moving again. The guns don't feel powerful at all and are just completely retarded with almost no recoil, they are all standard such as shotguns, machine guns, a rocket launcher, and a weak pistol that does NOTHING. The most original weapons is probably an axe but even the more powerful weapons take awhile to tear down foes coming after you. The enemies are just absurdly difficult to bring down even on the easiest setting. For some unknown reason the weakest enemy (Blood Spiders) just swarm after you and you have to find the sac holding them and getting there can be a pain since this leads into the lame healing system. Other enemies range from werewolves, minotaurs, griffons you name it.

These are cool enemies and shouldn't have anything go wrong but it does anyways! They throw so many enemies at you and you never feel powerful enough to take them down so you're constantly scrounging your health with the difficult healing system. You have this power from your hand called Animus, so you take Animus Clouds from dead creatures and you use this for health. You hold down Y to take it, but it takes so long to absorb it all and this is NOT good when you have a ton of guys shooting at you or creatures clawing at you. You hold down Y again to heal yourself, but as you can see, using the same button to heal and absorb is not going to work very well. When you're near clouds you absorb them instead of healing and vise versa. If you double tap Y (why are we double tapping with so many buttons!) you can do an Animus Push to stun enemies and this does absolutely nothing. Now when it comes back to the combat you can't use any melee attacks, no cover system NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH, SQUAT! You have to hide behind everything and peek out like a stupid old PlayStation game from 6 years ago. This makes things ridiculously annoying during the unbalanced levels that are badly designed.

This game just has so many things wrong you wonder what there is to like? Well its for the sheer epicness that game seems to pull off with 300 foot Golem, a HUGE krakan you fight in London, and even the giant Griffon's are cool to kill. If you can bear through this 6-7 hour campaign you can find some fun in this game. With a different story, decent graphics, cool enemies, and lots of big bosses you can have fun once. Legendary, this definitely, is not."
1882,2,"I got interested in this game due to my like in games like Deus Ex., and Splinter Cell .  One review compared this game to Deus Ex and caused me to waist my money.  This game is horrible.  Once your spotted everyone knows where you are at all times no matter how good you hide or stealth maneuver and the character development is boring to say the least"
1883,2,"This is the most over-hyped game I have ever played.  The story makes no sense (why nuke his own people?), the dogs are impossible to kill, no matter what you cannot influence the story so no matter what you do it doesnt matter, NPC cannot be pushed or moved out of the way (however you often are pushed out of the way by NPC).  And the dogs are impossible to kill, which is unbelievably annoying.  Huge dissapointment.  I cannot believe I bought a PS3 just for this game."
1884,2,"This is mostly a re-post from my Imperial Edition review (since most of the points made there are still correct), but an Amazon reader actually gave me an account to try the game as it is now. My updated findings are below:

A HUGE thank you to Mr. Williams for sponsoring this review by giving me an account and asking me to re-review this product. I apologize if you do not find the revision to your liking, but it is my policy and moral obligation to give a just and fair analysis of whatever I look at.

It has now been almost 2 months since my initial review, and I decided to give the game another shot after a reader asked me to re-review it, going as far as providing me with the means to do so. To my surprise it is actually improving - slowly, but surely. Since I can't give the game 2.5 stars (Amazon does not allow you to do this), I am going to leave the score at 2 - but I do believe the game is currently at a solid 2.5 stars.

I played it for just over 60 hours and ended my gaming about 3 days ago. I was going to post this up sooner, but didn't have the time.

First of all, let me get this out of the way - the game is STILL a botters heaven. In fact some quests are downright unfinishable because of all the bot camping, and I won't even mention crafting. Bots simply zoom around getting ALL the nodes.
The GM's take a pretty aggressive stance against them, and I saw GM's kill (and ban) botters while questing on more than one occasion.

The game still has plenty of bugs, but I didn't see anyone dodging attacks non stop or teleporting while engaged in PvP (like I did in my earlier review). I also didn't encounter a single game halting quest bug! Having said that, I did find and see people reproduce three major glitches.
There is a Sorcerer bug that allows them to have unlimited Magicka.
There is a bug with Nightblades giving them unlimited Stamina.
There is a bug that allows you to bypass all siege damage.
All THREE of these bugs are game breaking.

All in all the game has improved quite a bit since my original visit to Tamriel, but it still has quite a bit to go before I consider giving them my money.

Finally, the price of entry has been greatly reduced! The game is currently 50% off on Amazon and only $9.99 at both Best Buy and Walmart!
That is a pretty good deal, since it comes with a whole month of gametime. $10 bucks to try a game out is really a no-brainer, and should be taken advantage of.

The story, scenery, and world are still amazing, and if you can look past all the issues, the game is worth a try - and at $9.99 IT IS a bargain.
Having said all this, I still believe that TESO will go buy or free to play early next year (2015), or when the console versions come out (whichever happens sooner), as the game still very much feels like a paid test of an unfinished product - that is designed for couch play.

My original 2 star Imperial Edition review is below:

Let me start off this review by saying that I LOVE, LOOOOVE TES games. I loved them ever since I first played Daggerfall (before all the patches that made it playable), and played Arena shortly after I finally finished Daggerfall. I have been following TES very closely from that time on. Heck, I even liked Redguard, and everyone I know tells me that game is terrible.

So I was extremely excited and ordered the Imperial Edition from GMG as soon as I found a 20% off code (I had to buy two copies, so I did not want to shell out that much for an MMO with a monthly subscription fee).

I have been playing this game for a while now (remember Imperial Edition gets a nice head start option), so I think I can finally give a decent and most importantly spoiler free review of this game.

Early access actually started off pretty well. The character creation is great, and both my wife and I were able to create the avatars we wanted. We also quickly jumped into a friends guild - and that is where our first surprise came... EVERYONE in TESO can SEE your ACTUAL account name. In fact adding a ""friend"" to your list, gives you their actual account name.

My account names are always weird and have nothing to do with my real name, but my wife usually uses a combination of her first, and last name. Meaning everyone and their grandmothers knew they were playing with a female. This lead to a lot of people (even those from our guild), that would start asking her where she lives, her age, and if she was hot, etc.

In fact a lot of ""friends"" that we met in TESO had their names and year of birth as their account name, since they were not warned that this name will be so freely and publicly available. Heck, some people even had their state in there! I kid you not, one of the players I met had FirstNameLastNameStateDOB as his user name. What an epic fail in this day and age to not CLEARLY warn users about something like this.

After we got out of the ""newbie"" areas, the game started to really lack polish. A LOT of quests were broken, requiring you to re-log and hope you get in the instance where the quest is working. The best part is that while you re-log, you can actually experience a character rollback. I completed a quest, only to re-log and find out that I never completed it. These random rollbacks had a very major impact on the game for us. We all lost money, experience, time, and most importantly LOOT and materials...
Moreover, a friend that was playing with us re-logged only to be greeted by characters that were not his. He called it a night after that. The issue was fixed the next day. That's right... There was some database linking error and the poor guy literally (temporarily) lost access to HIS characters. Not a big deal, since it was only the second (or third) day of playing, but this is unacceptable.

The game was taken offline for a good 10 hours (or more), and everything appeared to be fixed, however after playing for a few more hours we ran into broken quests once more, and more harassment for my wife due to her very obvious account name (that we petitioned to have changed with no response so far).

While I first loved crafting in this game, it involves quite a large chunk of time AND inventory management, making it lose its charm rather quickly.
Want to research and improve something? Well that will take 6, 12, 24 hours real time. You do not have to be on for this, but that is QUITE a time commitment. My biggest problem with this was when I started research on an item and logged into an alt. Came back a few hours later only to find that my crafter got rolled back and never started the research... So I started the research again and went to sleep, ONLY to log on the next day and find out that he was ONCE AGAIN rolled back to before he started the research. That was quite infuriating.

Now lets move on to the inventory system... Which is downright terrible as it gives you only 60 bank slots total... That are shared across ALL your characters... 60 SHARED bank slots is a joke, since one crafter can easily fill those! Everyone in our guild is simply rolling alts as an alternative bank, and I personally have 4 characters with full inventories as my bank mules... I have people in our guild that have to use spreadsheets to keep track of who has what materials, and that is a pretty big design fail.
Either give each character 60 bank slots, with 10 shared slots on top of that - or increase the shared number of slots to 120+.

Speaking of crafting, most nodes in the game are guarded by NPC's, and since they are not instanced to your character - it means that other players WILL run up to the node while you are taking care of the mob and steal it, quickly running away as you finish the mob.

This gets even worse in dungeons. The best loot I have seen so far is either crafted or comes from a dungeon chest (not the dungeon boss). This means that you (or your group) can be fighting said boss, and some idiot can go loot your chest... So you get NOTHING. To make things even better, if you kick said ninja looter they stay in the dungeon with you and are free to continue ninja looting... What is this? I don't even....

The game is not all bad however. It does have some epic parts! You can become a vampire or werewolf, heck you can even get impregnated by a wasp and give birth to a waspling that will follow you around (and protect you), thinking you are its parent.
My most ""OMG"" experience so far has been riding through a forest and having my horse make a nervous neigh, only to find that it was scared of a wolf that was fairly close by. That is pretty epic and really made the world feel alive.
The quests and instancing also get an honorable mention. Although it is still a very theme park like game, I really enjoyed some of the voice acting and quests. The heavy instancing also makes it possible to feel like you made a real difference on the world.
Moments like that aren't too common, but they add a lot of extra to the world, making it truly feel lived in.

Finally lets move on the Pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance, and the reason why I am giving this game such a low score (I would actually give it one star had it not been for some awesome moments).

As of right now, there are two HUGE issues in the game. Widespread duping (and it will get a lot worse when people find out how easy it is), and the client is being trusted with a LOT of things. I will not be saying exactly what, but a simple HEX EDITING program is ENOUGH to allow one to speed hack, teleport, have unlimited rolling AND dodging... Meaning PvP in this game is about to become utter garbage. The PvE is affected as well, but PvP is completely shot.
Apparently ZeniMax did not learn from the folks at Cryptic after they had plenty of issues due to keeping so much clientside. Google ""mmogfails"" and read up on their disaster. Unless TESO acts fast, I can see the same thing happening here. Also check the comments section for more info. I can't post links in this review.

I think I will give this game some time to mature, maybe a year or two, and play The Secret World and Guild Wars 2 in the meantime. Both are buy to play games, and do certain things better than TESO. The story in TSW is the best I have seen in any MMO to date, and GW2 does most other things better than TESO. As a bonus, neither game allow you to cheat and gain a huge advantage over legit players.

Sorry Bethesda, it really pains to give you guys a two star review - but certain problems with the game (mostly due to poor design choices) really hinder its enjoyment for the Mitchell family. WHY... WHYYYY trust the client in this day and age?

As a side note, I want to comment on how terrible ZeniMax support is (and not just because they haven't responded to my wife's account name change request after multiple days).
My acquaintance (a 62+ year old retiree that I sometimes do computer work for) was BANNED from the game due to a ""TOS violation"". After multiple (failed) attempts at contacting support, he finally got a reply and was un-banned after an ""investigation"" took place...
He is now literally done with the game. You lost a very big fan there, and it was all due to sloppy work. Not nice ZM/Bethesda... Not nice at all.

I hope that you enjoyed my unbiased, spoiler free review of TESO. Now I would like to make a request of you, the Amazon gaming community. If you downvote my review, can you please post your reason for doing so in the comments section? I have posted nothing but our honest opinion and experience of/with the game, and would like to know why I will be getting downvoted (and I know those are coming)... Unless you work for ZeniMax damage control that is, or never bothered to read my review and are downvoting simply because of the way I scored the game. Than feel free to ignore my request.

Anyway thanks for taking the time to read my rather large piece, and see you all around!

4/11/2014 UPDATE: Please check the comment section. There have been some interesting developments after I published this review.
4/18/2014 UPDATE: WOW, I didn't even notice that I started getting helpful votes. I really wonder how that happened. I was sure that this review would be forever buried and tagged as unhelpful.
4/18/2014 UPDATE 2: Oh I see. The dupe finally got out and people started looking a bit deeper. Honestly I am surprised it took this long, since anyone messing around in the guild bank had a pretty high chance of figuring out how to do this. We discovered it by accident and made a forum post about it... Only to have it deleted. Shortly after that it was all over guild chat and people were duping Grand Soul Gems and more. I honestly thought the dupe would get out that same day, but apparently I was wrong.
4/19/2014 UPDATE: Seems like ZeniMax introduced another bug into the game. This one will allow you to get unlimited mail (chests) from your hirelings. I simply don't know how to react to the way they are running things.
4/19/2014 UPDATE 2: Earlier today I received an e-mail from a reader that asked to remain anonymous. This e-mail contains instructions on yet another dupe, and this one (like the original) will allow you to dupe everything. I just tested it out and can confirm it works. The author informed me that this exploit has existed since launch. I think I am going to call it quits with ESO. I don't want to reward incompetence with money, and most importantly my time. Consider this my final update to this review. I will be doing the only thing ZeniMax understands and speak with my wallet. Honestly, it seems to me as if ZeniMax is simply using the PC crowd as beta testers for their console release of the game. It is my firm belief that TESO will be buy or free to play within a year of its launch. My guess, sometime in early 2015, probably a bit before April.
I would also like to make a request. For the last few days people have been sending me quite a lot of ESO bug reports and issues. I want you all to know that I have no impact on them getting fixed. Please don't e-mail me regarding this game.
Edit: 5/18/2014 UPDATE: Although we no longer play The Elder Scrolls Online, I want to point out that ZeniMax DID in fact charge us both right out of the gate for an EXTRA month (on TOP of our ""free"" month of gametime). We were charged an extra $15 when we entered in our CD-Keys. This is unacceptable! After a few e-mails with ZM, the money was refunded back to my credit card, but that is yet another example of ZM's incompetence.

Thank you for your time,

- Sam"
1885,2,"What a lackluster game. A sub-par shooter that screams like it belongs on the PS2 or the original XBox.  Bodycount is an incredibly basic shooter game.  No special weapons, no sniper guns, a silenced pistol you never need, and several machine-gun style weapons that are all the same.  The enemies are the same guy over and over again, with little variation.  Maybe a ""boss"" guy once in a while who's tougher to kill. The graphics are pitiful, and so many times you're trying to pick guys off from far away and could really, really use a sniper rifle instead of yet another SMG.  No health or special items to pickup - just magic orbs that refill a special action option that you never use.  The levels look very much alike, and it's really a chore to just get through the game.  I'm utterly surprised by all the great reviews here.  At least I got this really cheap, used.  That's the best thing about the game."
1886,2,"People may think the game is good, well there not wrong. The game is great. My only problem was that the online services weren't working. It said ""Call of Duty Advanced Warfare service is not available at this time"". It's not my connection since my it works for my brother, some people say it's an update and some people say it just happens and it will get fixed after attempting to play online three times or waiting a minute. That didn't work. Don't buy this crap unless you like playing campaign. Activision said it will be fixed in the upcoming patch. I'm not waiting. I want to play a game I waited for. If your patient get it. I'm not."
1887,2,"Don't buy this game if you're looking for a totally updated version.  It's not.  Its really just an expansion pack -- a good one (unlike loopy landscapes and the other one which didn't really add much).  I really think that you shouldn't label a game part 2 unless you completely redo the interface, plot or some other MAJOR part of the game.  This was just some nice add ons and tweaking."
1888,2,"The main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after Twisted Metal 2 and people were expecting A LOT of improvement, but the expectations were in vain. :(

The game isn't all THAT bad, I mean... Mr. Grimm still cool, there is a new Viper car, you can use ""rain missiles"" as weapons, some of the characters and stories are VERY funny, the graphics were improved, the Rob Zombie intro song was AWESOME, and the London, Spaceship and Blimp stages were GREAT.
NOW! The reason that this game suck's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic, the special effects are NOT shocking at all, you can't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction, many characters look lame, if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up, and many stages are VERY small.

P.S: This Twisted Metal sequel is terrible, but at least is NOT GARBAGE as Twisted Metal 4!!! That game wasn't even a Twisted Metal game, that was more like ""The Circus War"". X(

Adios."
1889,2,"Over-Hyped Game. Period. Game play is repetitive, have only about 6 different types of zombies, about 8 different guns, and graphics that really are sub-par. The strong side L4D does have is Multiplayer, but compared to other juggernauts like Call of Duty 4, L4D is laughable in comparison.  Then again maybe I'm just not a zombie fan..."
1890,2,"This is an example of someone who has a decent story idea and then implements it so poorly with game design.

Horrible camera, very annoying combat, graphics don't utilize any modern graphics enhancements (kind of caps out at mediocre 1080p-ish), and poor character control too.

The atmosphere is good and the story is decent, but it definitely isn't worth the supreme annoyances from so many of the other parts of the game."
1891,2,I bought PS4 just for this game and it SUCKED!!! I should have bought XBOX ONE instead!
1892,2,"I am a Rock Band fanatic.  I play on Roland V-Drums, I use the expensive Logitech guitar, and I even own the RB stage kit!  I have more peripherals than anyone really should.  I have Rock Band Night at the house with friends once every couple months at a minimum.  When my RB mic went on the fritz, I looked for a wireless alternative.  I have always been a fan of Logitech products and was pretty excited to see this mic.  The mic looks good and feels great.  Obviously another quality Logitech product.

The problem is that the microphone does have a small amount of lag.  Unfortunately when playing a rhythm game, that small amount makes a world of difference.  It's incredibly frustrating when trying to sing on X or Hard vocals and deal with the lag - you have to sing the notes early.  Of course whether you sing early or on time, it still sounds terrible because it's like an echo in the room when the sound comes out of the speakers.

Even if you don't play on hard or X, inexperienced singers have a terrible problem even on easy or medium.  People keep failing out because it just doesn't register close enough.  I would definitely not recommend this microphone to any Rock Band players.  It's a shame because the mic does look and feel excellent."
1893,2,"let's be honest, this game was beautiful, but the play is just dull"
1894,2,"Came a little wide, does not look very good at 2..."
1895,2,"The problems with this game are so glaring that I feel I can reduce them all to a simple list without much explanation.  The final judgment: This game suffers immensely from poor production and design.  The only saving grace are the rare things that did go right.  Good for hardcore fans; anyone else should just play Disgaea - a superior game in all ways.

The Good:
1. Lots of content (This game offers tens of hours of dialogue and combat. [+1 star])
2. Short intro (You get to the fighting very quickly.)
3. Deep weapon and character development systems (Weapon upgrading and character leveling have some good depth to them.)

The Bad:
1. Tutorial does not even scratch the surface of the core game mechanics
2. Extremely stereotyped characters in blatant anime fashion (Quiet, introverted protagonist; blue haired girl is more reserved; blonde haired girl is spunky.) [-1 star]
3. ""Strategic"" combat is not strategic at all (It's more of a puzzle game, based on how you position your characters relative to themselves instead of based on enemy movements.) [-1 star]
4. Diluted story (Half the dialogue consists of ellipses ""..."" which is what goes for drama for Japanese developers. Also, literally the 5-minute intro is as simple as this: 'The world was created, and suddenly evil monsters appeared.' Very creative... NOT.) [-1 star]
5. Playstation 1 graphics (On the 360, are you kidding me?)
6. Lame gimmicks (Morality meter based on bizarre principles. Choosing to ""go the south route"" made my character more ""Dark?"" Really? WHY?? This is stupid.)
7. It is so repetitive and boring they had to add an auto-battle feature that basically makes the entire game an e-book that has the worst story since the Transformer movies."
1896,2,"I bought this game because I enjoyed the first Twisted Lands game (Shadow Town) and thought the second game (Insomniac) was ok (if not up to par with S.T.). Started playing, but was very disappointed in the storyline and the graphics. The hidden object locations consist of but a handful of locations that you play over and over again, and the graphics within the H.O. portions are muddy. Also, each time you get an item to use (key, puzzle piece), you pretty much have to use it right away at its designated location to proceed -- rarely do you have multiple items in your inventory and have to put thought into where you could use it. The exception to this is when you get an item and have to use it in a way that doesn't make sense (using a pair of handcuffs to lift a manhole cover, for example). I got most of the way to the end before a huge electrical storm hit and blew the circuit in my house, and when I went to start up again, the game said that the file was corrupt and I would have to start over, but ... nah, the game wasn't interesting enough."
1897,2,"There are few redeeming qualities to this game, most of which have been refined by other games.  Those qualities include a ranking system, server browser, and weapon customization in multiplayer.

Unfortunately, there are serious issues with this game.

Pathing - If you don't walk the right way, the game will let you know it.  This means you'll end up tripping up over a fallen brick and be held up while trying to evade enemy fire.
Late Kills - There are serious delinquencies with when a hit registers.  You will routinely (50%+) find yourself dying even after you've fallen behind cover.
Sniper Kills - There is relatively little advantage to being a sniper.  You WILL be outsniped by SMG's and Assault Rifles.  The SMGs have a surprisingly great accuracy even in sniper conditions.
Latency - Nobody knows what their lag is in multiplayer since the values don't appear in the latency column.
Multiplayer vs Single Player - It's obvious that two different companies created the multiplayer and single player versions.  The glaring differences include the lack of prone ability in MP, the lack of reloading while sprinting in SP, different key assignments between SP and MP, as well as some graphical variations.
Lack of Skills and Weapons - There are very few different weapons in MP that you can earn.  There are absolutely no new skills to learn, so coming from COD:MW2 will be a downgrade in that type of MP experience.

I'd much prefer to play BF:BC2, which feels almost exactly like the same thing."
1898,2,"This game has a great concept, but so much lamer than the second one. Kind of boring in all honesty. The graphics are really bad and cartoony as well. Not a great purchase."
1899,2,Meh...
1900,2,Huge disappointment.  It's ok if you're ok with paying $60 for a glorified map and weapons pack for MW2.  Just OK doesn't cut it in the world of FPS.
1901,2,Nah boring!
1902,2,"First of all, I picked this game up, midnight launch at Gamestop, because I did not want to wait for UPS to get to me at five in the afternoon. I live in the city, but I guess its there route? I love amazon, but I didn't want to lose all that time I could be playing on waiting. My excitement for Dark Souls 2 was really high. (woe to me though)

(Please actually bother to read my full review before actually down voting. Seriously, grow up. )

My expectations were REALLY high for Dark Souls 2. But I guess FromSoftware just couldn't bring themselves to make a better game... They are stuck so deeply in their ways. And that's both good and bad. If I were you, I would seriously be careful about reading all the positive reviews of the game. This game has a lot of good ideas/elements in it, in theory, but in execution, it fails right through the floor.

Anyways, Dark Souls 2, is just like Dark Souls 1 in a lot of gameplay mechanics. Boss fights have there gimmicks, fighting normal enemies, is actually worse than Dark Souls, in the sense that, frame's from enemy attacks are completely cut out. Trying to back stab enemies, is a LOT harder but really needed to do any damage, but almost impossible to do. Trying to parry enemies, is A LOT HARDER, almost impossible. Upgrades to weapons, while to some degree more straight forward, they are still lacking. Upgrading a weapon from 1 to 10.. is a tedious task. Because unlike Dark Souls 1, your merchant of choice, only has so many items on hand.. and then after you buy so many, come back, yadda yadda, rinse wash and repeat, you'll get more, maybe. I believe its on which area of the game you make it to.. combined with how much you buy. Although I don't have the guide, so I am not sure about this. But its tedious to say the least. Horribly annoying (Insert curse words here) at best.

So instead of a enemy character in game, going through a full range of emotions, giving you time to react. Such as A,B,C, and D, where as D would be the completed end action of the enemy. They just go A to D. So you see an enemy getting ready to attack, you gotta time it perfect, and not block, but roll out of the way I am guessing? Now when this is on a little small ledge and you can't do that, well your pooper is going to get banged by the enemy. So its frustrating. In New game + with red phantoms, who are basically walking tanks and apparently don't have to meet the same stat requirements as your character.. it turns into a nightmare, even with +10 weapons.

Enemy tracking is next to godhood in this game. Enemies who are in close range, rarely miss you. On the other hand, your player tracking...works at best, and at its worst, will either pull you to your death if an enemy gets knocked off a cliff edge, or even when the automatic targeting is turned off in game. For some reason it still is on? Like you will be fighting one enemy and then the targeting will jump to another enemy completely throwing you off balance right at the most horrible time to do so.. Leaving you cursing in frustration.
From my perspective, in how fast the enemies attack you, and the range of motions they can go through verses.. the range of motions your character goes through, stamina recover, etc... The game is fundamentally broken. Not so much broken in the sense, that you can slowly slowly make your way through it, as long as you don't die and lose your souls.. and then die and lose your souls permanently trying to make your way back to said soul drop. Some areas of the game you'll get bottle necked, and that's the way the game is designed. Its set up with a bunch of innocuous looking traps by the developers. Basically to see how far you can make it.. and how hard they can ram there estus flask up your pooper, because cost of the game wasn't enough.

They didn't fix one of the biggest problems they had with the first game. And that is, Souls still count as both experience and currency. Which makes the game so flipping broken/hard its not even funny. So you'll be fighting resource management all the way through the dang game. And like I said, if you die trying to get back to 20,000+ souls, 50,000+ souls... That totally messes you up. Especially if you have screwed up one too many times and have no human effigy's. They do have a few rings you can find in game, literally three I believe, that will take up one of your very valuable much needed ring slots because the stats upgrades are messed up. IE useless, that allows you to nullify death. But the ring breaks of course on death and then you'll have to spend 3,000 Plus souls to 6,000 I believe souls to fix said ring.

They tried to add in PvP to Dark Souls 2 and make it work. This was one of the hugest most tragic mistakes by FromSoftware in my perspective, because its trying to combine two completely different elements of gameplay and make it work...I can't comment on PC games. But on console games, as far as I know, most game developers have always had Story, and PvP separate, for good reason. It's like trying to combine oil and water, it can be done, but it doesn't work. Because when your fighting mini bosses, and that's what a lot of the enemies in the game are, you don't need some douchebag to show up and invade you during this time. And that's exactly what will happen in Dark Souls 2. Because from a strategic stand point, when is the best time to invade someone? when you have the advantage. The Co-op is fine. It works right now because you can find people to summon.. pretty much all the time, and you can get summoned decently. But so help you if you are trying to make your way back through the game and get your souls, and some BS magic user is the one who's invaded you. Which will most likely be the case. Because he/she will OWN YOU. Magic.. verses a melee based character.. unless your a god at Dark Souls2. Your pooper is going to be flooded with an object you don't want.

Speaking of Invasions. There is now a backwards invasion system, sort of. You get summoned forcefully to the world of another user when you enter a particular area of the game. The 'Rat Covenant' and your goal as far as I can tell, you know besides being pulled into PvP you don't want to participate in, is to either defeat the user... or make it to the end of the area.

So then if the gameplay mechanics, and underlying structure of the game is basically broken? What's good about Dark Souls 2?

Well, Dark Souls 2, has a TON of great armor, at least aesthetically that you can get. Has a lot of very very cool weapons you can get as well. Now even when you upgrade them to max. Their still not going to be as potent for you, as they are for any enemy character using the same weapon. It has a pretty cool world, nice fantasy setting. The enemy designs are nice looking. Some are even sexy looking.

They actually fixed the crossbow gun, you can now manually aim it. Which is wonderful. The range on Archery is better, and the aiming movement on it is a lot better.. you can look a little higher when firing off an arrow, and you can aim a little lower then in Dark Souls. Archery is improved over dark souls, not by the standard it should. Archery is still playing third fiddle to melee, and to magic its far off..

They improved the moveset of a lot of weapons.

But upgrades, while straight forward, you just don't get the much needed umph from the weapons you need to face the enemies... verses the trouble you go through to collect the materials to upgrade them. The scaling, even on upgraded weapons, again, its not all that great.

And I really believe like I mentioned above, that a lot of this is FromSoftware trying to make PvP and PvE go together. Quite frankly the only thing they've ever gotten right is the fact that you can be invaded.. but as far as balance goes.. I don't think its something that will ever work out. Just because of all the elements involved.

So to sum it all up in a nice little neat package. The world seems better, seems bigger, but its really just as small as the first game. Levels are just a bit more open, but it isn't an open world at all. Travel is improved. Weapon moveset's have improved. Cool enemies, some cool characters you get to talk to. A lot of cool armor sets, if you can find them or get the drops. Drop rate's have not improved by much. Fundamental gameplay and mechanics of the game are broken because they are trying to combine PvP(Player verses player) and PvE (Player verses enemies in game). You'd think they would have learned more from Dark Souls and other RPG's. You'd think armor would actually do its job but it really doesn't. The difficulty curve of the game goes at a steady climb and then just spikes through the roof toward the end of the game (Maybe I should say ""ends""). So you will probably start running into a lot of brick walls in the game. The game is designed with a lot of traps. So its not like they say ""learning from your mistakes"" its ""Learning to spot FromSoftware's traps"" would be much more appropriate. They think this is making the game hard.. but anyone can put a person in a box an then beat the fire out of them, and call it ""Were making this challenging"" but that's not really making the game harder, so much as making the game abusive to the player.

A lot of awesome elements in the game. And it really could be such a fun experience and really bring friends together. But being as co-op is sporadic at best. (Kinda depends if everyone is in the same area and hoping someone is human and actually has some human effigy's to use).. Overall the game just turns into a hodge podge of mixed emotions. My own personal experience with the game was as follows:

 This is cool, maybe I can team up with some friends on my xbox live list, NOPE!.. new areas to explore. Fall to my death. Get pushed to my death. Fall through a hole in the ground get ganged up on by petrification lizards.. Get man handled by the enemies no matter the armor I am wearing. Get man handled by bosses. Walk into a boss fight that literally has a room full of poison. Fall to my death some more. Get pegged by archers from a mile away. Start to get effing bitter about this. Get confused about what I have to do. Friend reminds me of obscure forest of fog.. Make a little headway. Get owned by a giant mammoth enemies.. quite literally. It helped they had archers backing them up. Grow increasingly bitter as I fight my way through the game. Get lost some more. AND FINALLY beat the game. Start new game plus... and just invasions out the wazoo. Every dang time I'm turning my head, invaded if I am online. Garbage... Bitter bitter. Break a controller. Speaking of which, their seems to be MORE LAG, in between input and action from your character than Dark Souls.

Long story short, if your competitive, and have fighting spirit.. don't play this game. Seriously avoid it. Because you'll want to win. But the game will just keep crushing you no matter what you do. So you will probably more likely get bitter about it. So highly suggest taking breaks from the game on a regular basis before things get bad. That was my strategy anyways with the game. Still end up killing off a controller.

The only way to win this game, is to not play.

Overall the game is okay. Nothing great or innovative about it. Aesthetically on console the game is alright. And I know some people say that ""looks don't matter"" ""resolution doesn't matter"" but in the Dark Souls universe where ""tells"" by the enemy is what makes the difference between life and death a lot of the time, that and gameplay matter a HUGE AMOUNT. And the game is lacking a little on that front. It is harder than Dark Souls in its own right.

Again I really want to emphasize that my hopes were high, but 3/4 of the way through the game, that just turned to bitterness as I started getting smeared against the walls upgraded armor and all, as things ground to a fault. Because the further you make it into the game, at least with a melee based character, no magic, no miracles.. you start to realize things are broken bad.

Buy at your own risk.

This is just my personal take on the game. Good luck. Thanks for reading.

Update #1 April 6-2014: I have the option for ""Cross-Region play"" on allowed, and I am not getting summoned at any decent pace. I'm in new game plus and I don't know if everyone is like ""Forget it"" or what.. but, its kinda lonely when looking for help with bosses. And that's another thing Fromsoftware really didn't fix. Yeah you can get an AI to fight the boss with you, on most bosses I believe, but the AI just flipping gets manhandled by the enemy AI. So its useless for the most part. Its frustrating needing help.. and hell I can't get it. And like I mentioned above, I have armor that's +10 Alonne Knight armor.. and spider boss with its little flipping minions are two shotting me.

Update #2
Their is a part in the game, where having a key, will help you with a certain boss in New game plus. The boss being the prisoner lady. Aright, fair enough. To get to said key, you have to go through, basically a bell tower, EVERYTIME I have gotten invaded by one or two grey shades... Isn't that wonderful? So I am being forced into PvP, I can't find anyone to summon to aid me ( I have the cross region activated for hopefully more people?). But I need this key to make the fight a little easier. The boss fight with all the gargoyles, you can't make it through without help, unless your just flipping lucky. I've come close to making it through by myself, but that last gargoyle always seems to nick me. And since your armor is made of paper even at +10 in Dark Souls 2, especially newgame +. This is a huge problem. I have +50 Endurance and +29 Vitality for weight management, plus the Third Dragon Ring, plus the Royal Soldier +1 Ring to cope with weight.. and much needed stamina.. and it just gets chewed through. I can't tank properly because my stats are not allowing me to..

That being said, I was also thinking that Dark Souls 2, really reminds me of Castlevania both in its fighting mechanics, as well as its lore. In Castlevania series, the castle keeps coming back, like its a living entity or something. In Dark Souls 2 its like, hey the same thing keeps happening over and over..  It is different, but just by a little.

Also, Dark Souls 2, the fighting mechanics, even though they happen in a 3D environment, its a really 2D fighting style. Another words, you gotta try and dodge attacks, because two or three hits will kill you, just like in a 2d side scroller. And the enemies, even though you shoot them in the face with an arrow.. that should be a critical strike every single time.. you should be able to cripple any enemy in combat, by attacking their armors or something.. But we don't get anything like that. So the combat really has this dated feeling to it. Enemies are weak to poison, fire, magic, and ""Hexes"".. which reminds me of a lot of Japanese RPG's I've played, but not in a good way. You beat your enemies to death with a sword instead of actually cutting them. Combat is really dated, that's what I am beginning to get from my playing experience.

The 3d world, is just not taken advantage of. Not enough innovations happening in the game.

Update #3

Apparently even after defeating the area bosses you can still get invaded by grievers, (red spirits), now I knew you could with certain areas as a grey spirit. But this is flipping ridiculous.

If your like myself, and you enjoy co-op, this will be a big turn off. Now I could just go through new game again and see if its any different, or if this is because of patches. FromSoftware/BandaiNamco have basically enabled a bully system. Here you are, minding your own business trying to farm. And you get invaded by some douche bag, EVEN after defeating an area boss.

All these people who claim to like PvP, I'd say theirs a few amongst them who really do enjoy it, and those guys are the ones who put down red soapstones, or join the covenant where you can fight in an arena, against other individuals. All these other guys no they don't like ""PvP"" they just like being the biggest grievers they can be...showing up at the worst possible time and screwing someone over. That's what they enjoy. They know it, but most won't admit it. And if they could invade the same person over and over second after second, they'd do it.

Update #4
I get summoned in co-op, in the crypts, I am clear of enemies when summoned. My host gets killed by an trolly invader, game respawn's me SMACK DAB in the middle of five syan soldiers.. I can't even roll away. And they all just turn and slaughter me of course. I mean, against five.. it was just stun lock city.
I think this is horrid game design. FromSoftware seems to have no concept of ""functional"" and ""working well"""
1903,2,"I have always enjoyed the CoH series and this expansion pack in a sense gives us a little bit more of what they wanted and that's being able to get up close and personal with some of the major battles that has been fought in the game. I like the idea that Relic has moved this game from more of the same to a more tactical RTS. But it's not enough...read on and see what I am talking about.

This game is reminiscent to the recently released Men of War but prettier and contains much less micromanaging.

I do like the idea that you still accumulate resources and use them to upgrade your men based on the amount of kills incurred. Also some of your solders get new abilities based on the upgrades like calling in artillery strikes or healing your solders. Also I like that this game is a bit more fast paced than Men of War where ONE scenario could take a long time to play with sometimes overwhelming odds only problem is, sometimes it feels arcadey.

The controls are sometimes a bit touch and go as the direct firing system you have to learn to manage and switch over to access another squad without taking the present unit off of an objective.

One of my complaints right now is that sometimes the enemy AI doesn't respond to attacks and just sit there while fired on or sometimes they retreat from my units  for no reason or that some kills on enemy armor is insanely quick.

But my biggest gripe of them all is there are ONLY 9 MISSIONS total?? (and it doesn't help that I am 5 missions in!) Ok...wait you mean to tell me this is called a 'standalone game' in which you don't need the original games and you ONLY OFFER 9 missions that you can breeze thru in a day or 2 Relic?

This is not a good deal unless the people who want to play this game online don't care and unfortunately I am not one of them. This wouldn't fly as even a seperate solo game!

Relic, listen closely...when you produce a game like this for the single players out there, 9 missions is NOT ENOUGH. Try doubling that number or better yet, go back and let players use old maps from the originals to play in the new mode, don't cheat us by giving a thirsty person a sip and steal 30 bucks for it!

Worse yet you don't get any new countries such as Russia, Japan or Italy to tangle with and the new units just don't feel all that special.

I will be the first to admit that I fell for the okey doke because I liked the other 2 games but this felt like an afterthought and not worth a 30 dollar purchase. SO be warned.

Heck take notes from the little guys from Russia that produced Men of War!!!

You guys dropped the ball on this one!"
1904,2,"As an Old school 3rd strike/ Alpha player, I'm not to happy with the new counter/anti block system.  It completely changes the gameplay of the street fighter series making this one completely unique and on its own arrangement.  For those of you who are die hard old school street fighter fans, They've gimped 1/2 the moves and buffed up EX-Combos.  They even took out some of the greatest Finishers as well.  Overall a decent but not over the bar game with Enhanced Graphics.  Def a great game to Rent or barrow, but Not a game to invest 50 dollars on.

I had pretty big expectations for this release and found myself either shelving this item or basically turning it in for store credit for pre-release of resident evil 5.  Again, if you are hardcore street fighter fan, you will be disapointed, if you don't trust my opinion buy it and see for yourself."
1905,2,"Unless the company created a patch you are unable to overwrite saves. Horrible glitch. My system locked-up during intense battles. Very big disappoint. The game had potential, but the glitches destroy any fun or potential this game ever had."
1906,2,"This is the same exact game that came out 18 months ago for the X-Box. To prove it, the game still uses WWF and not WWE. The roster was not updated, so its still the roster from late 2001. There is no story mode (Road to Wrestlemania), instead there are championship modes where you need to go through 12 wrestlers to get a title shot. The Raw arena is the ONLY arena and there are no backstage areas. Nor is there any real hardcore action, because even though there are 100s of weapons, these weapons are helmets, tables, jack-o-lanterns, chairs, bandanas and so on. The wrestlers do not bleed at all, not even with a code! There is a pretty deep create-a-wrestler feature, however you can only create 16 wrestlers even though this is a PC game! There is no RVD, Mysterio, Booker T and so on, however there is Rhyno, Spike, X-Pac, Credible and Haku. There are very few modes, exhibition and the king of the ring tournament. There are no table matches, ironman matches, or 6 man tag matches (even though the game lets 6 wrestlers in the ring at the same time). At least all of the titles are in the game that were in the WWF in 2001, Hardcore, Heavyweight, Light-Heavyweight, European, Women's, and Intercontinental. The play is very unbalanced, such as the Rock and the Undertaker can undoubtedly beat up K-Kwik and Taka, so there is no chance raising a new star! Another detail to the game is the new stamina bar, where your wrestler will get *winded* the more he runs and does power moves. So Rhyno cannot do gore after gore, because he would get tired. With there being a stamina bar, there is also a *voltage* bar, which is basically one long bar that determines who is winning and when you can do finishing maneuvers. The controls are unique, where you have an attack, grapple, block and action button. The attack button is capable of several attacks, such as hold up and press the attack button will do a dropkick, hold down and press the attack it will be a kick or a punch. It?s the same with the grapple button. The action button can do anything from perform a taunt, pin an opponent, pick up weapons, put on clothes and climb the turnbuckle. The graphics and sound are amazing, but what fun is the game if there are no modes to keep you interested in?"
1907,2,"After having the G933, the sound quality of Astro A50 is actually poorer than the cheaper logitech counterpart....
it's not a bad headphone, it's just really not worth the price tag... after comparing it to 6 other of my gaming headphones (including the G933) I believe it should have a price tag at about 140 USD instead (with the additional price for the convenience of the charging station)"
1908,2,"Before I start, let me explain that I'm writing this review from the standpoint of an occasonal video gamer, namely, me. This review probably would not hold true for hardcore/professional video gamers.  I have played all of the classic Mario Bros games, and loved them all, except for this one. For one reason, and one one reason only. For the casual gamer, controlling Mario in a precise manner is an exercise in futility. If you only play your games a couple of hours a week like me, if you are not a ""pro,"" the human language cannot describe just how much this game will frustrate you. I mean it, the control is HORRIBLE.  For those of you over the age of 21, try to imagine this: You're very very drunk, and trying to walk down an ice covered slope. That would be EASIER than controlling Mario in this game, in places where it matters the most, precise maneuvering in tight spots. You can't use the control pad at all, just the joystick.  With all of the brilliant minds working for Nintendo, I would think that they could have developed a better way to control the character through the use of the control pad.  Another thing. If you are prone to car-sickness or other types of motion induced illness, you can't play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time. Believe me, I'm not stretching the truth. I served 10 years in the USAF, and did alot of flying during those years, so I'm not exactly the ""weak stomach"" type.  Would I recommend buying this game? By all means, yes, if you are a hardcore player. The graphics are pretty cool and have a definite charm. For all you pros out there, I would agree with a 4 or 5 star rating for this game.  For the occasional gamer like me, I would recommend renting it before buying it. Your experience may or may not be as bad as mine.........."
1909,2,"It's almost painful to see a game with this much potential fail so miserably.  The premise is superb - a lone mage fighting hordes of enemies with a wide variety of spells.  Unfortunately, the controls and gameplay kill this promising concept.  Switching between the different spells that you need is cumbersome, and you can only save in designated spots.  The graphics are probably the only redeeming features, as the spell effects are impressive and it is interesting to watch Arran age over the course of the game from a young boy into an old, wise wizard.
Overall I can only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of spellcasting-based games and if you can get a cheap purchase/rental price."
1910,2,"I wanted so badly to like RE5 as it was one of the games I was Most looking to play for some time now, sadly enough I can not possibly give this game a high review simply due to its overwhelming flaws.

On the positive side the game looks great, story line is good enough to be a RE game but the game is all over the place as to what it wants to be.  There are levels that I felt like I was playing RE and then there were other levels I felt as if I was playing Tomb Raider, or another random action game.  As for enemies in the game while there were a few eye catching bosses and fights nothing was really remarkable and the majority of the bosses have a ""shoot me here spot"" which is easily identified.

The absolute worst part of the game is Sheeva, if you are playing the game single player and not co op I swear she eats your ammo and power ups, constantly gets in your way and when you absolutely need her to do something even as simple as go get an item and bring it to you it seems to take her a lifetime to do it, those who have beaten the game surely most know what I am talking about, and her character is just annoying with her lines (well every character seemed to be in this game especially neo from the matrix.....I mean Wesker).

If your a fan of the series its worth a play, if you are a fan of the old school puzzle style RE games stay far away as there are hardly any puzzles to be had in this game."
1911,2,"Lost Odyssey has great visuals, especially in the many (and I mean many) movie sequences. In the end however the gameplay is repetitive and you are dragged by the nose the entire story line.  The storyline is one big clich around the central theme of immortal characters, the other themes are the same from every Final Fantasy game from which it borrows the feel and turn based combat style.

Due to the very high quantity of videos it feels like something you are watching rather than playing, and occasionally the game allows you to play through a couple of combats to give you an illusion of interaction. The voice acting (in English at least) is absurdly bad and cheesy, soap opera style, the script of the story doesn't help and the actors must have felt somewhat helpless with the lines they were given (specially the interactions involving the protagonist, who is trying to be far more serious than the rest of the project).  The only truly artistic part can be seen in the poems that appear in the form of dreams, although completely devoid of any gaming element they are (some of them) truly well made.

Without spoilers one can only wonder what they were expecting placing characters like the grandchildren in the game. I honestly felt silly through major portions of the story for playing this. The lack of control over saving also makes this a difficult game for the busier player since you cannot be assured that you can play ""just another 10 minutes and save"".  You save when they let you save, you play when the movie is done, and you fight at every six steps. The combat system is the FF turn based we all know but with a timing mechanism of two rings (to create SOME sort of interaction by the player) that while it seems like a good idea it gets boring as hell.

As a final note the steady progression of the opponents makes no sense, at some point you are battling regular soldiers who are still a match to your characters despite the fact that you are 20-30 levels higher since the last time you faced them.

In the end I felt the Lost Odyssey is a childish game they purred a lot of resources in. It isn't worth the time though."
1912,2,"I won't go into the rules of chess, so if you don't know how to play it, then by me saying this does follow the rules of chess well and is programmed decently enough to pass as a standard chess game won't mean much to you. However, what was supposed to make this version a little different, was not just the fact that it's an animated version of the board game (as in your pieces actually walk and move and what not) but when you do take your oppositions piece or vice verse, it cuts to a battle scene outside of a castle between the two pieces (eg: Knight sword fighting with Bishop etc). But there is one thing I wished they would have included, and another thing that ruins the fun of whole game.

The thing I wish they would have done, is when two pieces do come together and go to the battle stage, you could actually battle it out. This would take the rules of regular chess, and make it rather interesting that instead of it just taking the piece, you have a chance to let it defend itself and fight back, so that maybe your piece isn't just taken... this would be an interesting version of chess to play. And all they needed to do was maybe give a piece a life bar that carries over to the next round if they challenge again, to keep it fair from those gamers who know what they are doing vs an opponent who doesn't, so it doesn't just give an unfair advantage.

And now to come down from la la land and stop wishing for what had not transpired in this game, I will move onto why this game is strictly not enjoyable to play. It's not the sound, or the control, they are standard NES day passable. No, it's the speed of the game. It's SO FRICKIN SLOW!!!!! If you move your Knight piece, it takes about 7 to 8 seconds for it to move into place. It slowly walks to the space in-front of it, which takes about two seconds, then it moves to the one in-front of that, and that takes another two second, then to the next, then it turns to face the other way, and walks into position... and whats even more annoying, if you have a piece in front of it you are moving by, that piece slowly steps out of your way, then steps back into it's position it came from after your piece has snailed passed it. This became so highly annoying I could not even bare to finish the first game, I just had to turn it off.

I know Chess involves patience, but this slug speed movement of pieces is ridicules. I don't know if I had a defective cartridge or not, but I have also seen an emulated online version of the game that moves just as slow, so I don't think it was just a bad game, just bad programming making you have to wait 8 seconds to move your knight. Which would lead to players being so annoyed with that piece that they would just leave it alone and not use it unless necessary which just takes away the strategy of the game. Even moving long distance pieces (queen, castle, bishop) took forever if I wanted to move from one side of the board to the other.

IF you have the patience to play something like it's in slow motion, then you may enjoy this game, but quite frankly, if I was playing a real game and someone took this long to move a piece from the moment he grabbed it, and wasn't thinking about if he should or not, and just doing it to take 8 seconds to move a piece to his chosen position where he knows he is going to put it, I would pick the chess board up and smash it over his head before sticking every piece up his nose and slamming his head against whats left of the board. Now that would be a violent version of chess!!!"
1913,2,Sending a CODE in the disk packaging is very pathetic. We should have received a disk for what we paid. Developers are getting really lazy. This code better work!.
1914,2,I bought these for my son to use on his Vita and he did not like these at all.  I was very disappointed with this item.
1915,2,"Nice Statue, cheap tiny music box, 1 track cd, the worst game ever played in the AC line for me. The game play is not just horrible, it is filled with bugs and errors and Ubisoft servers are always down. If you like getting stuck in walls, not being able to open chests with a little money in them, the control system you have been used to being completely different...then the game might be for you. Be sure to read the current news about their stock going way down, the thousands of complaints, see the many videos out there, and if your smart buy a different game!"
1916,2,"Ah, The Force Unleashed II.  The fact that this game was made at all is an oddity.  While the first Force Unleashed was the fastest-selling Star Wars game of all time, it didn't particularly review well, and a staggering number of gamers quickly voiced their frustrations with the game's broken controls, cheesy force graphics and its detrimentally short length.  Still, that game did boast a phenomenal (and canonical) story that fit in perfectly with George Lucas' Star Wars lore.  The game shows the birth of the Rebellion against the Empire at the hands of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, codenamed Starkiller.  Beware of spoilers ahead, if you haven't finished the first game.  There were two outcomes possible...you could kill Vader and end up a mindless slave of the Emperor, or Vader would kill you, effectively making you a martyr and giving strength to the Rebellion.  The Force Unleashed II begins under the assumption that you chose the latter path.  That is its first problem...

With that ending in mind, the story of The Force Unleashed ended...for good.  Lucasarts, however, were put on the spot to create a sequel, and to do that they had to deal with the pesky problem of continuity.  The result is a bland, contrived story that comes nowhere near the splendor of the first game.  Starkiller has been cloned, though it's never quite revealed if he is in face one of the clones.  Once he escapes imprisonment by Vader, the game begins as Starkiller's #1 priority is to find Juno Eclipse, his love interest and former pilot from the first game.  This motivation is played up too often, but comes off as whiny and selfish.  Moreover, the plot never moves on from that, making it fall flat on its face as it basically goes nowhere.  The end of the game features a similar ""light side"" or ""dark side"" ending, so we'll see how that ends up in the hinted-at sequel.  Ah well, the gameplay...

Right off, The Force Unleashed II makes a fantastic first impression!  You're thrust into a thrilling fight to escape the planet of Kamino, with some impressive combat and a couple of awe-inspiring sequences where you're falling down to a platform far below...rain and obstacles coming at you while you use the force to dispose of them.  The combat in this game is ultra-tight and a vast improvement from the first game.  Starkiller is POWERFUL here...almost too powerful.  At your disposal you have twin light sabers (which can also dismember your opponents), the force lightning and the force push.  Soon after, you're given the force repulse, Jedi mind trick and light saber throw ability.  The result is an astonishing array of options for you to wreak havoc at your foes.  New kinds of enemies are introduced at regular intervals in this first level, and you have to figure out how to best defeat them.  Some are immune to force powers, others block all physical attacks.  By the time you finish this first level, it's not hard to feel exhilarated by the action in this game.  Then you hit the second level and do it all again...and again in the third...etc.  You'll fight wave after wave of enemies, but they're all the exact same enemies you fought in the first level.  It never introduces anything new.  After a short while, the game quickly becomes a chore until quite suddenly...it ends.  Yes, this game is short.  So short in fact, it's downright insulting.  You will not get sixty dollars' worth of content here.  On normal, you're looking at 4-5 hours...3 on easy.  There is basically no reason to pay full price for this game...at all.  I would highly recommend giving it a rental instead.

The game's graphics are light years ahead of its predecessor.  I was frequently very impressed with the level of detail and how well the game runs.  You will occasionally run into some minor glitches and see enemies or obstacles floating in mid-air, but it doesn't happen too often.  The pre-rendered cutscenes are immaculate.  Unfortunately the same level of detail wasn't given to level design.  Each level really only has 2 or 3 different ""rooms"", which are repeated ad nauseum until you reach the boss.  Oh yeah...there's only 3 bosses in this game, and only one (the end of level 2) that's really great.  Also, speaking of levels, there's only about 6 of them and most get really boring.  This is because the majority of the game is spent on Kamino (which is grey and rainy) or an orbiting spaceship (which is grey and dark).  There's also a very very brief level on Dagobah (which is grey and jungle-y)...you see where I'm going with this.  Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but the locales chosen for the game are so bland!  Why not follow the example of the first game and give us some variety?  The game's second level is gorgeous...why couldn't we get more of that?

So yes, this is The Force Unleashed II.  It's a fun game at times, but the horrendously short length keeps me from recommending that anyone fork over full price for this game.  It's a shame because the game has so much potential!  But in the end, it comes off as a rushed product.  Whereas the first Force Unleashed had a great story to make up for the poor gameplay, the exact opposite is true of the second game.  Unfortunately, there are many more games in this genre that feature great gameplay AND good stories (see Dante's Inferno, God of War III, Enslaved), so you decide if a sub-par Star Wars tale is worth it to you."
1917,2,"Product: Pure Chess (PS4) by VooFoo Studios
Rating: 2/5 (below average)

I bought this game directly from the PSN as a Digital Download.  I have very mixed feelings about it.

Likes:
* Nice graphics, looks very attractive.
* Includes a minimal tutorial on how the different pieces move, but that's pretty much it.
* Includes 100 chess problems, involving mate in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 moves (20 problems each).
* The AI on setting 1 is useless, but once you move up to setting 3 or 4 the AI becomes quite challenging.  However, the increased difficulty is more than offset by an inability to resign a losing game (see below).

Dislikes:
* UNABLE TO RESIGN (-1 star): There does not appear to be a way to resign a game against the AI if you're losing. I am literally gobsmacked that they neglected to code such an essential capability, and its absence seriously affects playability.  If anyone figures out how to do it, please post a comment.
* NO SUPPORT (-1 star): There is apparently NO support for this product VooFoo Studio's forum ... as of this writing, numerous requests for help spanning several months, and bug reporting by several other users, have all gone unanswered for many months.  There doesn't appear to be any third party site fulfilling the role either, so anyone looking for support on this software is going to have a frustrating time of it.
* BUGGY (-1 Star):  Several trophies are bugged, poorly designed, or both.  I've also read a lot of complaints online about the server being down, and being unable to select non-random opponents.  After several failed attempts to connect myself, I eventually gave up.
* ADD-ONS:  I cant really single out VooFoo on this, since EVERYONE does it, but the game only comes with a few basic chess piece styles, and only 3 choices of boring and unchanging music.  There are some really beautiful pieces available for download, but you guessed it, they all cost extra, and there are no upgrades to the music, even for money.  IMO, you're better off simply muting the game and turning on your stereo.

Bottom line:  This game is pretty, and I very much wanted to enjoy and play it, but the missing resign capability, the apparent lack of support by VooFoo, and ongoing problems with their server, have all soured the experience for me, and I've since uninstalled the game.  I recommend saving your money and looking elsewhere for a more complete program that is actually supported by the people who wrote it.

NOT RECOMMENDED"
1918,2,If you're used to playing open world games with easy to use controls then this game is not for you. I was told the game was open world but it follows a story. The controls for this game are awful. I played it once before I traded it in for a better open world game and I play a lot of FPS open world games. I wasn't impressed.
1919,2,"A lot has been written about the constantly-required internet connection, so I won't bother to rehash. Needless to say, it's a joke.

However, I have a lot of problems with the gameplay itself. First and foremost, the game is ridiculously short. You can blow through it very, very quickly - too quickly. If not for the unskippable in-game cutscenes, I bet this game would clock in at under 4 hours. And that leads to problem #2...

The in-game dialogue cutscenes cannot be skipped. At all. If you want to replay a level, you have to sit through the same tedious stuff over and over and over. This is especially annoying if you're trying to complete challenges - have fun sitting through ten minutes of the characters repeating the same stuff, over and over and over. It's excruciating.

Furthermore, the stealth elements are nowhere near what they used to be. Drop a bad guy and want to hide his body? Oh, wait, you can't move bodies in this - Sam will just leave the corpses where they are! Very stealthy and smart! Or, rather, the opposite of smart. There are so many flawed components of the gameplay that my mind is fizzling right now as I try to remember them.

I got this game for $3, and from what I can tell, that's about all it's worth. For those of you who spent $50 or above on this, you have my sympathies. And Ubisoft? Get your crap together for the next game, because Conviction is a dud."
1920,2,"Pros:
- Bullet time.
- Music gets you in the rhythm of the game.
- Blowing up cars in the car chase sequence is a fun distraction.
Cons:
- Repetitive.
- Cannot strafe! How do you dodge bullets in bullet time if you can't strafe?!
- Graphics on XBOX is very poor- looks like they took the lowest common denominator of graphics and just cloned it for each platform rather than chosen higher resolution textures or applied antialiasing.
- Bullet time effect does not show up in cut scenes.
- Camera gets in the way of the fight scenes.
Recommend playing Bloodrayne instead and enable bullet time all the time. You get much more satisfaction of seeing bad guys getting diced up into tiny little bits in slow motion.
..."
1921,2,"I got the game because of a sweet deal but returned it.

The game looks amazing, but the gameplay wasn't really what I expected. This game is a lot like the Dark Souls series, meaning you're going to die, a lot. You're not going to have frequent ""checkpoints"" either so expect to replay a lot of difficult areas.

If you were hoping to get some co-op gaming in like I was, don't bother with this title. The co-op experience in the game requires you to spend in-game currency to summon your friends into your gaming session. You also have to re-summon them into your session everytime they die, or after each area's boss is defeated. The same currency is also required to progress your character, meaning you won't be able to progress your character and easily maintain a co-op experience. Basically the co-op system is more or less designed so that it is only used in rare cases where you need the extra help, rather than just trying to enjoy the game with your friends."
1922,2,"I'm a great gamer. I'm a fantastic gamer. I've played video games for many many years. I hate games like this. If you make the slightest mistake you're dead and you have to do it over... and over... and over. I got stuck doing the dumbest things over and over and over again until I got it ""just right"". It's so annoying. A modern game shouldn't be this particular about jumps and landings. It's like the most annoying game I've played in the last ten years."
1923,2,After months of use it has started turning green and the inside of it has started scratching up my beautiful majoras mask 3ds. I liked it at first but now I kind of regret even keeping it on. It was fine the first week then came the scratches and the ugly green tint followed.
1924,2,The controller I bought wear like crap around the left joystick... I know its not because of first person shooters or whatever because I've had it for less than a year and its totally weared. I also have an older ps3 controller that i bought in 2009 and it barely weared down... so it has the same features but it did felt like cheap plastic
1925,2,"I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter after she absolutely LOVED and literally collected and did everything in the Lego Movie Video Game.  This one she (and I for that matter) found confusing, difficult, and she was even scared during some of the Dr Who parts (it was creepy with the vampires and flickering screens).  Being 6, she didn't even know barely any of the franchises so I can only imagine this appeals to older kids or adults who have experience with all or most of them.  At any rate, between the fact the game just isn't good and the fact that SOOOO much content is gated behind expensive additional purchases, I cannot recommend it and will be returning to Amazon."
1926,2,"After playing all previous AC games (just finished AC: Revelations with 100% score), I wanted to continue story and FINALLY get AC 3. I have to admit that I'm quite disappointed. Game is NOTHING like previous AC games. While story is still amazing (really a masterpiece, in my opinion), everything else seems to be done wrong somehow.

Please note, my review is for PC version only.

I have installed this game on a fairly powerful laptop (Samsung Series 7 gamer) with i7 CPU, 16 Gb ram and nVidia 675M graphic card. It also has SSD 240 Gb as primary HDD, newest drivers for graphic card etc.

That being said, game is glitched to the boot. It looks more like a bad port from consoles than a proper sequel to one of best PC game franchise of all times. I'm not sure how much DLCs can repair this, I still didn't install any of them as I was hoping to finish the original game first.

Second, the rich, open world of AC is nowhere to be present. Yes, you can EXPLORE around, it is easier to get to vantage points and synchronize but pretty much every other aspect of AC is gone (at least at the beginning). No purchase of buildings, no opening new gear, every other roof has eagle-eyed soldiers and streets are full of soldiers too. It feels that there's more potential enemies around than regular NPCs. Very restrictive start.

On top of that you pretty much have to follow a single mission because, well, there's pretty much almost nothing else to do! Yeah, deliver the letters (occasionally) is a welcome break and you can play a few games (mostly early versions of actual table games we know today) but that's it. After couple of hours of playing I feel bored - yeah, there's that feeling that sometimes soon this should become a full fledged AC game but somehow, I doubt it.

On a more positive note world is much more detailed now, graphics was never better (although I don't care for quite angular and sharp-edged ground) and at least that pulls the game up a bit.

Still, it is AC and I will finish it which means that this review will be updated but so far, this is extremely disappointing game from the AC series. I do hope that AC: Black Flag will be better."
1927,2,"From the previous chapter of Fire Emblem: This has taken a turn for the worst.

The Storyline was way too-divided between '2 main characters' instead of one. On top of that, there seems to have been a drastic change in some of the character's relationships as well as just the overall theme and tone of the story.

It would be okay to me if they just introduced new characters to add-on to the previous installment of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, but for some odd reason that didn't happen.

This game is harder than the Path of Radiance, however they changed too much of the game's mechanics in this one to the point where veterans would have to learn a whole new game - and that's not very fun. In addition, the ""supposedly"" transition of the data-file from Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance was negligible. Basically your heroes' stats would only be affects if they were a maxed level unit. (a level 20 promoted unit).

They attempted to balance the Weapons Triangle so fiercely that I believe they took away the uniqueness of what each class is 'intended' for. For example, they would allow ranged weapons for every class now: Swordsmen, axe-wielders, and lancers that there just seems to be an overlap against mages and archers. They made it so that every-class was basically a generic-bland.

Of course I'm making a biased review because I didn't like the ending.

Replay Value: 3/10. After you beat the game, you will be given the option to start ""A new game plus."" Although you may be able to make some slight differences of the outcomes, ultimately the ending is the same. It kind of defeats the purpose of re-playing the game."
1928,2,The controls are extremly hard to use and the game is extreamly hard I didn't like the game at all.
1929,2,"To start: Left 4 Dead 2 is not a sequel but the same game with very few enhancements set in a different locale. It's literally the same game. For the full MSRP I cannot suggest even a die hard fan of Left 4 Dead to purchase this, more out of principal than anything else. For $35 though (The amount I paid on Black Friday), the purchase can be justified for if you look at this game as DLC (Downloadable Content) the magnitude would certainly reach $35 as DLC... Certainly not $60 though.

That said... I can't rate the game too high as it is essentially the same thing and nothing more than a rip off. At the $35 price it maybe could have a 3 star rating but even then it doesn't feel deserved as GTA IV's DLC seemed to offer much more to the game and would maybe even be better classified as a sequel than L4D2 will ever.

No less, I stick with the 2 star rating across the board due to the fact that the best aspect of this game would be co-op but sadly is not. Playing online is fine and dandy but the real fun in playing any game is when you can do so with friends in the same living room. With L4D2, as with the first, you can only ever play two players in the same living room with a split screen. I cannot understand for the life of me why they would not allow all four characters to be played on a split screen. This inability, or laziness from the developers, is what ruined much of the replay value of L4D and the same here. It is absolutely inexcusable as to why four players cannot play together on a split screen.

Additionally, I must rate this low due to the fact you are paying a standard premium for sub-par packaging. The case the game comes in is thiner and lighter than most normal games (I noticed this at the store before purchased but assumed it was due to a cheap, flimsy 3-4 page manual... Surprisingly, the manual was in color which is one of the high points of this game). Back to the case... The case has cut-outs. Several sections of the case is cut out leaving the game itself entirely vulnerable to outside forces. If you removed the paper from the DVD sleeve the disc would be exposed the outside.

Valve, or their manufacturing company, claims environmental reasoning's for this cheap product. Now, I don't buy into the global warming hoax. There is no hard scientific evidence that the globe is warming or that human activity is contributing to any change in weather. For those in doubt please read the recently leaked emails. Moreover, Carbon Dioxide is not a pollutant nor harmful to the environment or human health. We as humans exhale carbon dioxide, they are going to tell us that the gas we exhale is dangerous to our own health? Hogwash. What's next: Swallowing your own spit causes throat cancer? Where does this nonsense end? CO2 actually helps plants grow more lush and full, it is more beneficial to the environment than not.

I digress... Regardless of how one feels about global warming as consumers we ought be outraged as the company is saving money by cutting out plastic and cheapening their products while not passing on the savings to us which means they are making extra profits and are assuming that environmental concerns will leave us consumers ignorant to their ploy of increasing profits while delivering an inferior product. If they wanna cut out plastic and cheapen their product, fine. It's not for the environment but for their profits and if for profits, and even for the environment, those savings most certainly should be extended to the consumer.

This yet another case of a major corporation using the global warming hysteria to cheat consumers and turn extra profits based on public ignorance. Don't buy into it as a consumer for if the savings aren't passed along to us it is nothing but devious. Same with T-Mobile wanting to charge their customers $1.50 every month for receiving their bill in the mail as opposed to only on their website.

Please pass on this game unless you find it for the discounted price. It's not worth it as is and certainly not worth the purchase based on principle alone."
1930,2,"Maybe I was expecting something different, maybe I came into the game with my expectations too high. I don't think that's the case, however, as I wasn't really anticipating The Evil Within's release. I got burnt out playing other games so I decided it was time to invest in a new game. I read many reviews comparing it to Resident Evil 4 so I figured it was a no brainer to purchase this game. Maybe my mind is cloudy because I haven't played RE4 in a few years but I can tell you that The Evil Within certainly didn't meet those expectations for me. I only made it about a quarter of the way through the game, then started playing something else. I will eventually come back and finish the game, but my actions are indicative of how I feel about the game as of now.

As I said, I read so many reviews that compared it to RE4. I wholeheartedly disagree with those reviews. The Evil Within's gameplay seems much slower and it works more off of game silence and eery situations rather than actual scares. I was looking forward to being scared. I wasn't. The Evil Within makes you feel like there is a big scare coming around every corner but it never comes, at least not for me. For this game to work, it HAS to be scary because the gameplay isn't enough to save it.

I'm not trying to dog on anyone who gave this game a good review. It just isn't for me. It's also possible that I didn't play enough to make it to the big scares. Unfortunately, the first few chapters of the game just weren't enough to keep my interest."
1931,2,"...definitely not worth the 200 dollar asking price.  I've used this screen because a couple guys I know bought it, but I'm much happier with my 7"" DVD player, which with the addition of 8 bucks worth of adaptors can have an Xbox, GameCube, or PS2 (or for that matter, VCR) hooked up to it.  Takes any RCA input.  Total price for DVD player plus adaptors (which were just male to male RCA adaptors) : 208 dollars.

And it'll play 3 hours worth of DVDs on BATTERY POWER!

Not to mention that I bought the darn thing months ago, and now you can get similar ones for about 175 instead of 200.  I don't know why anybody even buys these Xbox/PS2 screens anymore.  But they do.

Hell, pay 175, get the adaptors, brings you to 183, and that leaves you 17 dollars towards the 30 or so it costs for the DC/AC inverter that will power the whole shebang in the car (or HMMWV, for that matter).

I brought my Cube, PS2, and Xbox over to Iraq (it's going to be a long year, gotta have the games!), and I'm glad I chose a screen that works easily for all three.  If you have only an Xbox, and extra money, and really just want your screen to aesthetically match your Xbox, go for this...otherwise, buy a darn 7"" DVD player...it's a no-brainer!"
1932,2,"My daughters would love to be cirus stars, so we got this game and christmas and its barely used.  Its better than some we have, but its a little hard for a 10 and 8 year old.  Not terrible by any means, but my kids get tired of it quickly (unlike Wii Sports, Wii Fit Plus and Guiness).

I got this for $[...] on one of those Gamestop buy two get one free preowned sales and really wish I wouldn't have. I like having a variety of games for my kids to play but this one just isn't up to snuff.  Has better graphics than Farmyard and Redneck, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Don't waste your money. Its more important to pay more for good games than get alot of ok ones."
1933,2,"I'm going to say it outright; I waffled between NFL 2K3 and Madden 2003.  It came down to this.  NFL 2K and NFL 2K1 were great on the Dreamcast.  The last Madden I played was NFL 2002 on the PC.  Absolutely terrible.  Even though EA is the greatest gaming company in the world, I just couldn't buy Madden for the PS2.
So, anyway, I pop the game in, and despite the extra long loading time, and the annoying front end, the graphics are tremendous.  By far the best for any football console game.  The players look lifelike, and during a walk back scene after a play, a friend of mine who doesn't play video games thought that it was a real televised football game for a second.
Of course, graphics mean so little when it comes to playability.  NFL 2K and NFL 2K1 had great playability, in this game I found it lacking.  There are two big things that irk me, and destroyed a great game: too much randomness and too many little flaws.
You might be wondering what I mean when I say randomness.  What I mean is that it's hard to gauge how well you're doing when the AI is just wacky.  For example, about every fifth game, the running back cannot be stopped.  I shift the defensive lineman, crowd the line on 4-3 defense, take a man off coverage to plug up a whole, have three guys wrap their hands around the half back within two yards of the line of scrimmage, yet somehow the HB busts through for ten yards.  This happens, constantly.  When this does happen, the game is hopeless, and I either have to accept the loss, or reset the game.  What about the other 4 games?  I play dime defense, and I easily stop the run.
How about the flaws?  One flaw is offensive rushing.  It basically comes down to one question.  Do you want to establish the run, or do you want to try to win?  Another flaw is the problem of switching to a man in coverage.  Often times, when switching to a player, it seems like it switches to a player that is in no position to cover, while I'll swear there is guy who was closer, had the correct momentum, and could have easily hit the receiver.  This happens about one-third the time.  Guess what?  There are four downs.  I was screwed.  Couple that with the fact that if I nudge (not tackle, but graze him) a player while he's out in pattern, it's automatically pass interference.  Also, sacks are just rare.  Interceptions outnumber sacks 4 to 1.
The most annoying flaw?  Couple this with the player switching and PI bug mentioned above, and it's this: when the computer feels like passing, it will win.  The best way to stop a drive?  Give it a 2nd and short.  It will try to rush the next two downs, and that's the best way to stop it.  Not quite a grand simulation.
Other things annoyed me.  The long, long, learning curve for one.  Another is the extensive amount of plays.  Both of these take some getting use to, so it's not too bad.  Field goals are a little tough, especially when you're struggling for 30 yarders while the computer is kicking 50 yarders anytime it wants.
So, how did I do in a season?  I played franchise mode, which was neat.  Being able to sign a player (I got Chris Carter) is cool, but I'm not a fan of the little micromanaging that needs to be done, like negotiating contracts, or signing backups.
Anyway, I was the Packers, pro level, and I finished 6-10.  I was first in passing offense, and first in overall defense.  I was dead last in rushing.  I had one sack, and I was sacked 10 times (about 9 of those times were due to the fact that I had an empty backfield).  Farve through two times as many interceptions as touchdowns.
Here's irony for you.  I started off 3 and 3, then I started to learn the game and got a whole lot better, so I started losing.  Huh?  Well, let me explain.  I started to learn how to spot open receivers, figured out how which plays work, actually got a little rushing going, learned to totally stop the run, learned how to play defense pretty well, and usually got off to a lead.  This meant that the computer would start passing at almost every down.  They'd exploit the bugs mentioned early, drive down, and score, and keep doing this.  They're two minute offense is unstoppable.  Out of the last 10 games, I lost 7.  Four of those losses were due to this and I lost them on the last drive of the game.  Onegames I lost was due to unstoppable running back.  I maybe lost two legitimate games out of the seven.  Not fun at all.
Other things annoyed me.  The camera angles are not very well done.  Even the far camera angle cuts off the sides of the field.  Also, you cannot design your own plays.  What's up with that?
Lastly, they have the most annoying thing in sports game.  Level adjustment bars.  How bad is that?  I don't go to a golf course and choose to tee off where ever I want.  I don't widen the hole to make putting easier.  I don't pick up the ball and throw it twenty feet farther just because the course is hard.  I play the course as is.  If the course is screwed up, I just don't play it.  It's the same way with sports games.  Also, adjusting tackling or speed changes the game completely, and when you have to revert back when playing another opponent, it will mess me up completely.
Okay that was the bad.  Here's the good.  It's still a good simulation up to a point.  The feel of passing is unbelievable.  It's not like other games, you actually have to survey the field (unfortunately, the camera angles don't allow you to do it perfectly).  Granted, there are way too many interceptions, it's still the best feel, as opposed to previous games where you knew Steve Young to Jerry Rice would always work.
Two player is pretty fun, since there's no computer cheating to screw you up.  Finally, it's a smooth game.  You rarely see the phantom catches or tackle, and players don't go through other players.  It's safe to say it's a very polished, crisp, well made game.  You can see that a lot of time and effort was put into this game.
Would I recommend it?  Probably if you'll play a lot of two player (I have not tried the online version, though I heard there a lot of cheaters who pause right before they are about to lose).  If you want a good game where you can just sink you're teeth into it, just go out and buy a used Dreamcast with NFL 2K.  It'll probably be cheaper."
1934,2,"I thought this game was great as a kid, It isin't anymore to me.  it's like a bad version of california games"
1935,2,"I bought this game yesterday. I played on and off since then, between classes and a few hours at night, and then this afternoon... until I finished it. In less than 8 hours. Are you serious???! XBOX Live's popularity seems to have single handedly killed the single player game. I don't use XBOX Live. I don't need a 60 dollar paperweight. Don't buy this if you're expecting an immersive, detailed single player experience. The continuation of the story from the first Vegas is nearly unexistant. This isn't to say that the gameplay isn't fantastic, but when it ends so abruptly, you'd be disappointed too!

I am a HUGE fan of the first game and this game really let me down. If you haven't played the first Vegas yet, get that instead. You don't lose out on much from the ""improvements"" in R6V2, and the story was much better and longer."
1936,2,"Ok so i like this mouse and would give it 4 or 5 stars because the fit is great in my hand, its simple, its small, its uniform in shape, the led is amazing on the plus side, the dpi switch is perfect and is all u need, same with the side buttons, the clicks on all buttons feels great, the sensor -- i jumped into a match of csgo last night and i felt a little better without even getting used to the mouse, the braided cable is nice but it tends to snag on the corner my desk so i have it pinned with an ancient blank cd thing,

theirs only 2 negative aspects to this mouse one is the wheel, sometimes it just ""mystery moves"" it will basically over scroll sometimes making it inaccurate to use and for this i would give the mouse a 4 stars if everything else worked as it should, the biggest problem is the housing for the mouse sensor (go figure the most important part of the mouse) within 2-3 minutes of use i could tell their was some sort of vibration or noise coming from where the sensor is, especially if i picked up the mouse and moved it (i claw and finger, hybrid), i figured hey maybe thats just how its built

 i played csgo for about 2 hours then this morning i decide to test the mouse and shake it next to my ear now i can already hear a slight rattle (this wasn't there last night before i played csgo but it was only 2 hours) -- logitech i have seen this before in reviews but i was willing to take a shot to try and see if i could get a lucky mouse - it might be that they are just constructed that way, but logi really needs to address this, if my sensor and sensor housing was built with durability in mind this would be an amazing mouse, my g400 is like 4-6 years old by now and is still rock solid (mouse is just old and worn, the logi symbol is gone just from use haha so it was time for an upgrade)

-- to people who give this a shot i hope u get one without weird sensor vibration because it will eventually become a rattle, either way do some extensive testing the first night, on a side note i don't even flick the mouse like most do i have 600dpi, windows mouse setting 6, 1000hz polling, in csgo i use like 2.5 sensitivity and mouse accel 1.05 so my mouse movments aren't hard or taxing on the mouse, just another thing to keep in mind when purchasing i guess, and my last smallest gripe would be theirs a tiny scratch on the bottom, im thinking this is from manufacturer though because the rest of the mouse looks pristine new"
1937,2,"I was enjoying the game but when I came to the puzzle sequences it blocked them in white and I couldn't see the puzzle at all.
I have been trying to figure out how to fix, but having problems finding the right forum, to see what to do. I just tried reloading the game.  There is definitely a bug, it keeps dumping and I lose the game.  May have to just remove this particular game, and change my review rating.  I feel bad, because I really like the game. Now I am concerned as to whether Alawar games digital downloads may be defective, and I would be wasting money purchasing them.  Unfortunate because I really like their game concept."
1938,2,"I almost am sad to put two stars on this game having it for the PC but...

As you may be a fan and you may have read the foregone warning that there was only going to be  "" some content""  to start the game off.... it will throw you off to the point where you are going to wonder why you bought it in the first place.

Right now it feels like  BETA 2.0  -  there is just nothing there folks but re-hash plays upon the same Paris scene over and over ---- with increasing difficult and so on, so fourth.

It is however --- Hitman... but if you are like me that apperciates a well put together story of "" some kind"".... you'll be a bit taken back and lost. Its sort of like pre-eating a cake before it becomes one and then not really being hungry when it finally gets taken out of the oven.

I've read the increasingly wonderful  game community's reaction when one points this out --- apparently, everyone is stupid and ignorant for buying the product and not reading.....though it doesn't take from the fact that the game is hurting in reviews due to such an idea.  Its an interesting idea for sure --- why not have an incrementally expanding game? ---- there is just one catch.  You have to make it interesting and gravitating for people to give a damn about it.  How many times do you have to go through the same level and keep yourself interested?  This is not like waiting for the next season of  The Walking Dead or  Better Call Saul .... its  a paper-thin experience,  hoping that small tweaks and changing up the "" target""  through different NPC's is going to make you want to patron the game.

One mission?  I would think if I wanted to do something like this properly, I'd have a gripping story that immerses you into the intrigue and world of 47, give you about  3  missions to play through with a "" OMG!""  cliffhanger.  You don't get that with this one folks.  Its you and the same scenario.  Over...and over...and over...

I at least thought they were going to make an effort in that direction but my bet has came up short.

If you are really liking how this game looks, it is my personal opinion that you wait for  Enix to bring fourth more missions than buy it right now.  You are going to feel disappointed.  I won't be like the legion of trolls on  Steam  telling you to  get lost,  your stupid,  or that you have an education level of a neanderthal  --- I'm telling you like a respectful gamer.  Wait for more content.  Right now it isn't worth your money.  You would be doing a better justice by hanging out a friends house and playing this one mission before shelling out cash.  The more people do that, the more we are just buying into bad habits and money-grubbing ideas.  Its bad enough we've bought into buying games in  Alpha-Tests.  Now  we are blatantly rewarding developers with  Half-Games with the dangling promise of more......  ""Just come into the van kid! I have candy! ""

It sucks for us consumers and it sucks for us players as a whole.

I will change this review when the new content comes out and I am open to having my mind changed as they add to it but there isn't really anything right now but fluff and pyrotechnics....  and Oz is quite dead behind the curtain."
1939,2,". .  If it weren't for the fact that you just don't get that much in return for the amount of time you spend setting the game up.  The creator of the game spends a majority of the first 3 hours of ""game play"" giving you an in-depth look at Japanese history, and whereas this is interesting and all, it's not what I bought the game for.
I was looking for the old time fun of ""Nobunaga's Ambition"" (sp?) for the original Nintendo.  I used to spend hours tinkering with that game; playing and replaying different scenarios.  This game doesn't give you the option of deciding which battles to fight.  It just takes you to the next one and assumes that's where you want to go.
The animations are. . . good.  Not great; certainly not above the standard I've been seeing in other PS2 games.  The real drawback to the animations is that you get the same ones every time. .  If you fire a cannonade 5 times, you sit throught the same animation 5 times- and you can't stop it once it starts.  If your cavalry charges 30 times, you sit through the same animation 30 times. . .
On the plus side:  The whole game is attractive, with more detail per character (story-wise) than many I've seen.  And you DO get a MASSIVE  amount of history in the game (like it or not), not to mention a terrific glossary of terms and additional historical materials on the disk.
I'd have given this game 3 or even 4 stars if it had given more to me.  Unfortunately, more money and effort was spent on the animations than the storyline and playability.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE games that require a high degree of concentration, but this just got boring after a short amount of time.  Anyone have a copy of Nobunaga's Ambition?"
1940,2,BAD
1941,2,"I wanted to love it truly, but its massive and i have bitty hands apparently the buttons were almost 1/2 inch longer than where i would comfortably hold the mouse its  neat  oh and the texture of the mouse is awesome!! but my other problem was the tracking, it didn't work so hot I was testing it playing van helsing and a very click intensive fest that is, the logitech just didn't do well with it even though it was larger i could still click etc but i felt it just wasn't doing what it was supposed to and yes i switched the dpi a few times but it didn't matter which setting i had it at same issue. Sorry logitech I guess for anyone who is used to a claw grip you better look past this and get something else."
1942,2,"I've been trying for a week to get this to work.  I've been going back and forth with their support department and the game keeps locking up my machine.  From what I've seen of the game so far, it looks like you might want to stay away from this."
1943,2,Impossible to play on a keyboard....I thought it was for my PS4.
1944,2,Cord is not very flexible and has permanent kinks in it that i can't straighten out and the scroll wheel feel mediocre. The buttons and shape feel pretty good but the side buttons are positioned in a way that it is impossible to hold the mouse without accidently pressing them.
1945,2,"Barely works at all much less with any games. Its my bad for not researching properly, but who makes a mobile controller that has to be plugged in????"
1946,2,"With the exception of the mini-game called Mercenaries and the hand-to-hand finishing moves, Resident Evil 5 is a downgrade of the series in almost everyway. While Resident Evil 4 may not have been a straight up horror game, it did have a lot of elements that spooked the heebie-jeebies out of people (my sister stopped playing the game when she saw a women's head pitchforked upon a wall of a shack -- I rest my case). But Resident Evil 5 took out all the dwindling horror that Resident Evil was losing and made it a straight-up shooter, a bad one at that. Resident Evil 4 wasn't a great shooter, but the elements of horror, scenery and sense of dread - along with a pretty compelling story - made up for a little things such as: you can't move and fire (and come on, nobody complained), and . . . well, there aren't many other criticisms about Resident Evil 4 because it was a satisfying game and story; it was a movie that you could play. Now, the ugly younger brother, Resident Evil 5, came along. A different creative director - the dude who did Lost Planet one and two (makes sense, right? noooot). I have written lists among lists of a-z of just creative gameplay elements that totally ruined the game - things that I, as a fan were given control over, wouldn't have done if I had the power (if you're wondering what those things are, just ask and I will show you the light); and then the story, a total bore, a total letdown. We're talking Matrix to Matrix Revelations here people. Bad, bad, bad.

I am not a hater of Resident Evil 4. I'm not one of those early fanboys who just can't wrap their brains around ganados. I think that ganados were refreshing when I played RE4. So, when I give this game a 2/5, it's not because I'm afraid to like new things; nor am I going to blindly like this game because it's a Resident Evil game. This game is flawed and it's not imaginative. If CAPCOM took the top 10 Resident Evil fans of good taste and ask them 10 things they want to see in a sequel and what they don't want - they wouldn't be able to make a bad game. But the problem is that the creative director and the producers of this game just shut their minds and ignored the fans. And I'm not talking story so much as I am gameplay (although the story is worst of all).

What made ganados so memorable is the fact that they actually did things before attacking you; they worked in fields, they pretended to be human. In Resident Evil 5, the Majini were just on you like bees to honey. There was no interaction (barely) with non-infected. There was no John Carpenter's The Thing-esque paranoia of who's infected and who's not - something fan's like me have been hoping for for years! There's just nothing at stake in the story to care about (until they screwed up the franchise then we care too much in a negative way!)

I already stated the pros, now here are the cons:

1) Wesker's spunky personality and supernatural abilities beyond realism.
2) The straightforwardness of the campaign - no RPG elements, no point in exploring.
3) No typewriters (that's an important element to the series regardless of how silly it is!)
4) The weapon inventory!
5) The stage select screen (Resident Evil should be a story from beginning to end, this new feature allows players to overplay some levels more than others - and quite frankly, I see why - because some levels just aren't fun!)
6) No merchant.
7) Bad AI.
8) Co-op makes the game far too simple; Resident Evil should have the option to be single player (without AI partner).
9) There's no weight of decisions you make (at least Resident Evil 4 made you think you made differences by freeing that wolf and so forth).
10) *spoiler* Ricardo Irving's mutation alone was almost enough for me to stop playing the game. Matter must come from something other than thin air. Jack Krauser's mutation made sense because he was muscular and it was understandable that he was hiding something inside him; Ricardo Irving just turns into a huge sea creature in a matter of seconds (and how did the plagas know he was on a boat?)
11) The unsatisfied death of Spencer.
12) *spoiler* the unsatisfied death of Wesker.
13) The conclusion and the plot holes that explain Wesker's existence and strength.
14) There's no survival horror.
15) The only time a vehicle is used the game was On-Rails.
16) It was almost as if Paul W.S. Anderson was the creative director . . . that pretty much sums everything else.

The cons just go on forever and ever I'm sorry to say.

Resident Evil is the scariest game of all time; Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of all time; and this . . . this was a mistake and CAPCOM are falling on their sword because they won't own up to their mistake and change the course of the franchise.

I recommend this game to a non-Resident Evil fan who likes Gears of War. It's kind of like the Quantum of Solance; it would be a good action movie if it wasn't the follow up to Casino Royale. Sometimes sequels need to live up to their predeccesors, or they shouldn't be made at all."
1947,2,"Why did they remove the broadcasting in RTTS???  Horrible, boring, presentation in this mode.  Season presentation is fine, but I know they can squeeze more out of the Vita."
1948,2,This mouse didn't work for me but it was quality and I think it will be good for a lot of ppl.
1949,2,"I seem to be having a run of bad luck with games lately.  You know, spending lots of hard earned money only to be grossly disappointed.  Well, Brink disappoints me.  Other then the very beginning, I lost interest fairly quickly.  I wanted to like it as I always want to like something I spend my money on, but I just cannot do it.

Graphics are good.  Background sounds are good.  The voices coming through your characters in-ear speakers is just too much static noise when you are playing the game with a TB headset.  The weapons seems to be plenty, but most are just outright useless.  The special items like grenades and turrets just simply do nothing.

In campaign mode,as others have said, the AI are just about as dumb as they get. Plenty of times someone on my team is standing with the enemy and neither one is shooting the other.

Maybe I expect too much for 60 dollars, but even so, Brink is not worth 60 dollars as is."
1950,2,"I agree with many of the other posters here - the baldur's gate series (especially No. 2) and the superb torment (why don't they make an oblivion esq. sequel???)were outstanding and was let down initially by NWN.  I eventually spent quite a bit of time on that game online however, once I found a cool server.  I then gave it up and spent quite a bit more time on WOW, but I find myself growing more and more mind numbingly bored with that game and decided to give NWN 2 a shot.  I was suspicious however, with the relatively terrible reviews etc. and didn't have too high of expectations when I took it out of the box about a week ago.

The good-
The single player is a vast improvement over the original.  Being able to control your henchmen in and of itself greatly improves the experience.  The graphics are a nice step up, and found myself not overly dismayed by them.  They are by no means on par with oblivion, however they are vastly superior to the original.  The added classes from the 3.5 rules seem interesting, and the character creation / leveling process is pretty much intact from the original.  The storyline is good so far, about 3/4 the way done I think with the first campaign.  Not anywhere near as good as either baldur's gate 2 or torment, or the fallout games - about on par with temple of elemental evil I guess - but it is a lot better than the single player story in NWN.

The bad-
Muliplayer.  I just cant get the thing to run at all.  Stutters all over, crashes, simply gave up on it.  Too bad too because I was really looking forward to checking out the game online.
For the single player, the pathfinding is horrible.  Even worse than the original.  So terribly frustrating when you consider they have had a lot of time to tweak this.  In addition, the targeting is frustrating when it jumps back and forth between conversation and combat, loosing who and what you have targeted to jump to your main character and then leaving you fumbling back to try to target what you had previously to continue the fight.  The inability to switch the leaders of your party is also garbage.  Thirdly there are bugs where combat begins and the game will not let your pause - for 10 or more seconds at times.  These are simple dynamics that you think they would have fixed in play testing, however with the multiplayer as horrendous as it is I guess they outsourced the play testing to the equivalent of nomadic tribesmen in Mongolia.

Too bad too because there would have been some good stuff here if they could have made it work."
1951,2,"Well, what can I say, the game sucks. We haven't been able to get past the first level. Whenever you die, you start from the very beginning. What kind of crap is that. I'm tired of doing the same level over and over, and I'm playing it on easy. Yes, I suck at this rail shooter crap, but I have other rail shooters that I'm able to play just fine. Dead Space Extraction is one of them. It wouldn't be so bad if at least the game let's you choose what movie to play, but it only lets me play that stupid bugs mission."
1952,2,"The game is highly overrated.  In order to obtain gear and improve your character you can run strikes, run the raid, run PVP, or do the challenge.  Everything else won't give you any improved gear to get better.  The raid is like the old Nintendo games, where you have to jump platform to platform without a single miss over and over and over to pass the level.  Or, if you miss one shot, it is time to start over...
This is similar to the raid.  You will do numerous, boring and repetitive, actions within the raid where one mistake leads to starting over.  Additionally, there is no system to find other players within the game.  It takes an hour to find a group to play the raid and an AVERAGE of two hours to finish the raid.  Then, you will only get loot to improve your player around one out of every three runs to completion.  You will, however, get the same piece of gear you already have four times, or so, before you get something new.
The strikes are fun and the most enjoying part of the game.  Although it is difficult to find a group for the hardest strike.  And, once again, expect a piece of gear that you actually need to drop about 10% of the time.  Really low loot drop rates.
The PVP is the worst PVP I have EVER PLAYED.  Don't even waste one second on this garbage PVP.  You will shoot an enemy with 45 bullets and they won't die.  They will shoot you with one bullet and you will die.  The enemy will use their super charge and kill your entire team.  Your super charge, the same one, won't even kill one enemy.  I am a very experienced PVP player with thousands of hours in COD and Battlefield games.  This PVP is horrible.  I won't play it on this game, EVER, for no reason, for no loot.  It is not worth the bad game play to ever set foot in the PVP of this game.  They have better loot drops and gear rewards in PVP but it is not worth the terrible game play to get it.  I choose to not have the loot at all, its not worth it.  Worst PVP ever created in a video game.  It feels like Bungie has never made a PVP game before in their existence.  Really?  From Bungie?  The Halo people?  They regressed horrible with this PVP and made a true nightmare of poor gameplay and frustration in this terrible PVP.
The challenge is fun, but once again, you have to find players to play with you as the game has no system to find them for you.  It takes time.  Then it will drop rewards of the same gear over and over again.  However, still really fun to defeat waves of enemies and destroy a boss with your friends.
If you want all the loot to improve your player you have to play all areas of the game.  Some parts of the game are so bad that I skip them and will never get the loot.  Skip the PVP, skip the raid, do the rest and you'll have fun."
1953,2,"Let me get this straight, if you're a PSP fan and you have one and wanted to upgrade you're going to be forced to rebuy all your games and have no physical copy? That's insane, I have over 17 games sony, why didn't you just keep the UMD drive in? Yes it costs more to produce the readers and discs but you've also made this unit more expensive, so I'm failing to see where I'd get anything out of this unit. And  when support for the PSP is dropped for a new PSP2 let's say, you'll probably have no means of acquiring a game legally so why would I want this yet again?

I'm sticking with my PSP2000 since I'm not rebuying the video out cable and over 17 games that work perfectly fine on my current system which I love.

This review may seem a bit bias but just understand where I'm coming from, I love the games for PSP, I have absolutely no urge to run out and rebuy all 18 of them again because they decided to release a better system with no UMD drive. I prefer physical copies to hold in my collection since I tend to keep my games indefinitely."
1954,2,They don't seem to fit my 360 controllers.  This is the second set I have ordered.  Same problem again.
1955,2,Daughter does not like. It is too complicated for her. She is only four. I was very disappointed.
1956,2,"There are much better games out there for PC. Kind of crude, but at least it is a open world platform."
1957,2,"How is it that a sucky game like this one retails at almost $100. I purchased this game after buying and playing Fistfull of Boomstick (which is awesome, along w/Regeneration) I was very disappointed. Wish I could sell it at a New price."
1958,2,"mouse feels very ""plastic-y"". the click buttons kind of feel like sand-paper, which is a cool concept i guess (and some might prefer it), but doesn't feel good to me at all. i would not recommend purchasing this mouse."
1959,2,"Remember in FF13 where there were many diverse, interesting characters to choose from to build your party?  Well in this game, you're stuck with 2 god awful characters the entire game!

Remember in FF7 where there was the awesome Gold Saucer?  Well in this game, there is a casino too!  But... it only has 2 games: slot machines where you press 1 button repeatedly, and chocobo racing!  But wait, not the cool chocobo racing in FF7 where you ride the chocobo, no-no-no!  That would be too cool!  In this you only get to watch chocobos racing.
Oh yea, but don't worry!  The characters tell you that more casino games are under construction!  Except, you have to PAY for DLC to complete the construction.

Remember in FF13 when there was no DLC and you were free to enjoy the entire game?  Well in 13-2 there are loads of pointless, overpriced DLC like buying $5 boss battles!

Remember in FF13 how there was a sweet, interesting story, full of great drama, and uplifting characters?  Well in this one there is a convoluted, contrived plot about time-travel and is virtually drama-free!

Remember in FF13 how they were patting themselves on the back because they introduced a ""new innovative battle system"" instead of the randomized battles of yesterday?  Well, randomized battles are back!

Remember in all Final Fantasy games where the world was fresh and new, full of cool, scary enemies?  Well in 13-2, all the enemies are the same from 13 with barely any new ones!  Even better, half the areas are the same too!!

Remember in FF13 how there was a great sense of adventure and intrigue when you got to explore the world and fight awesome monsters?  Well, in 13-2 the exploration is bogged down by terribly lame puzzles and ridiculous needle-in-a-haystack objectives!

If this all sounds good to you, then you might enjoy FF13-2!
As for myself ... this thing is basically the antichrist."
1960,2,"Far Cry Primal is a decent extension of the Far Cry franchise to new territories however I think it falls short on many levels. The game feels more like it should be called 10000 BCE which is more accurate than saying primal. I say this because its basically a new IP with just the Far Cry name on it to try to get more people interested. Instead of having shooting elements and weapons and such everything is just reskinned as a bow and arrow, club,  with some other non original items for the period. That isn't to really ding it but it is to say it is not really a refreshing experience. I also think  the decision to go to this territory could have been a bit better if they left the ""far cry"" name. Far Cry at least has some cinematic storytelling to it, this does too but again its been reskinned for the period and unfortunately kind of done in an awkward manner. I think having them speak english would have made for a better game than going for a period based original language. I just can't connect with them.

In any case the game struggles to remain interesting after its first hour. It feels like the traditional tried and true Ubisoft action adventure open world experience fully with the capture the zone type of missions, clear out the baddies and get the zone, do things to recruit more allys, etc. So really there is nothing truly refreshing with the gameplay, there is even a special *vision* that enables you to find hints and clues in the environment. I think the crafting system is probably the most interesting thing going on but it ties too much into the find the ally so you can clear this one requirement to allow you to craft a better item thing. Its kind of annoying. I kind of wish it was more free and recipe RPG driven where you can generate stuff as long as you have the items on hand.

So overall this is a decent game however it leaves much to be desired. When comparing it to the other games in the Ubisoft portfolio it feels right in line with what they do. When comparing it with others games on PS4, its kind of lacking compared to say Infamous Second Sun or rpgs like Dragon Age Inquisition."
1961,2,"This is only Risen game I have played so I cant compare it to the previous two, I decided to play this game wile I waiting for Far Cry 4. Visually the game is just OK their are a lot better looking games out there but its not terrible. This game will never become half of what skyrim is for the two following reasons which I will go into detail on. First the combat system is the most frustrating I have ever played and second you are just thrown into the game with out any sense of how things work. The combat system is favored to your enemies, impossible to fight multiple enemies. Enemies are faster then you the best strategy I found is dodge until your companion tanks the enemy and then attack, also there seems to be a slight delay when pressing button to the preformed action. Very little is explained as far as how the game functions like joining faction, spells, upgrading etc. I have played for 12 hours so far and although I have my character upgraded enough so that the game is playable I don't think most people will give a game that much time just to be able to play the game. I did have to look up how to do many things online so I could progress, you should not have to do that. Also some of the quests don't show up on you quest list this happened to me in Calador very frustrating. The story so far is good, I completed a quest on Calador that started Chapter 3 I don't know what happened to chapters 1 and 2. I wish the quest layout was more comprehensive as far as some kind of order to do thing and importance (you need to do certain quest in order to get in some areas they should tell you what quest you need to do, but you have to guess or look it up as I did). I think that this game is a missed opportunity with a reworked combat system and better quest layout and some general instruction of how the game works it could be a great game, however in it present state its to frustrating for most people. Unless you have a lot of time to invest playing and researching better to skip."
1962,2,"I had very high hopes for getting this game, but it turned out to be simply terrible. For one, I can't get past the first level. The graphics are not so good, either. Probably the only fun thing in this game is cipher mode. If you are looking for a fun DS game, please take my advice and do not get this one."
1963,2,"This game is extremely disappointing.  I figured the 3D mario games would be good, since he's their flagship character.  This game is terrible compared to 3d platforming excellence like Jak & Daxter or Sly Cooper.  Considering how much precision the game requires, the lack of practical precision the game gives you in the controls is infuriating (more on that later).  The camera is awful, constantly having to be managed by you to get anywhere, and it DOES NOT SEE THROUGH WALLS.  I cannot believe how pissed the camera made me, giving me a fullscreen of wall during times requiring precision.  Oh, and the ""B"" button is both the talk and dive button, so if you were trying to talk to someone, but the talk context icon didn't pop-up quick enough, prepare to enjoy flinging yourself off cliffs.  Mario also does not respond well to surfaces he can wall jump or slide on;  If you hit the wall too smoothly for example, he won't wall-slide down it, he'll simply fall straight down as if there's no wall at all.  If you are falling downwards, it's extremely difficult to fall only a little bit forward, you often wind up overshooting your mark because the controls don't allow for fine movement unless you move the joystick at .1 mm at a time.  When you are dealing with disappering blocks, you don't have time for that kind of fine movement, but anything more than that ultrafine joystick movement sends mario running too far.

The game also almost never tells you what you are supposed to do next, nor does it give any hints.  I've had to consult a FAQ many times simply because I didn't understand what I had to do next in a mission, or even where I had to go to get to the next ""world"".

The most important jump in the game, the 180 degree high jump, also does not reliably work.  If you are moving in one direction, your jump height is actually kind of small.  In order to get decent air, you have to move in one direction for a half second, and then do a 180 and move the other direction and press jump.  Problem is, this jump does not reliably happen.  It works most of the time, but again it is extremely frustrating when it doesn't work at key moments, and you wind up doing a crappy normal jump instead.

Another, more minor quibble is that there is no option to invert/un-invert the camera y-axis or x-axis.  Nintendo chose to make the camera inverted, and you're stuck with it.  I got used to it after 2 hours, but man was it annoying.  How hard is it to program camera inversion???

This game has disgusted me so much that I've lost any interest in picking up the Mario Galaxy games, since they are 3D mario platformers as well.  I'm not going anywhere near this 3D mario garbage again."
1964,2,"Remote control doesn't work for PSP2 or PSP3, so You'd got to unplug it and use it like universal headphones."
1965,2,"Just a warning, if you get to the Extract data hub scenario and get the data extracted you must get to the exit point before turning the game off or you will be stuck.  What happens is it reset to the staircase and after working your way to the hub you'll find it impossible to hack the system (no 'A' button will appear to hack).  You can't open the door to exit either because it thinks you haven't done the hub hack.

Game plays ok, but the constant replaying the same thing over and over was maddening and then this bug just killed the game for me."
1966,2,Most people will turn this off after you have to follow a racing line the entire course or you will fail. Tutorials are a joke. Funny how this got past the creators. After this very annoying overlook the game is fairly solid. Graphics are substandard and handling is maybe a B- but pretty good for the first rally game.
1967,2,I definitely forgot this was a kids game.... beat it in a day...
1968,2,"Unfortunately this broke more things with Destiny than it added. This ""expansion"" is just a real disappointment. First, they shouldn't call this an expansion.  It is a weak DLC, falling far short of what the word ""expansion"" implies. There are a couple of new multi-player maps. They didn't fix anything that was wrong with the multi-player, just added a couple of typical maps that aren't really special. There is still really no story, just play dailies from a new vendor in the tower for some ugly shaders, class items and icons no one cares about. You'll need to be level 20 to use most of the content, level 30 for the Raid.  The raid is probably the the best part of this expansion, although to get to level 30 to play the raid most people will need to put in a ton of time. There are new exotics and raid gear, raising the level cap to 32 and weapon damage max. Unfortunately this makes all your old gear pretty much worthless.  Upgrading old exotics is too expensive. Old legendary weapons are under-powered with no option to upgrade. Old legendary gear is also worthless with no option to upgrade. The glimmer cap is still too low and bogus.  You share glimmer between characters but not Vanguard or Crucible marks? Makes no sense.

Bungie really screwed this up because the changes the ""expansion"" implements punishes early adopters and people that played the most. All the old gear you put in dozens of hours finding, doesn't mean anything anymore. If you have to play destiny, wait another 6 months until the next expansion comes out. If the second DLC operates like the first does, it will be over priced and punitive if you want any of the loot you worked hard for to mean anything. Save yourself time/anger/frustration and wait for a complete edition for $30 in a year if you absolutely have to play this."
1969,2,"Didn't connect to my PS2 slim at all. It did work with a third-party PS2 to Gamecube adapter I use however. I guess I'll just buy the Logitech wireless controller.

UPDATE: It DOES work on my Dualshock to GC adapter, as welle as my Dualshock to USB adapter. Not sure why it doesn't work with my PS2."
1970,2,"This is Sfmf speaking, and a sudden uproar of disses go to Mario power tennis! (A local residant from Volcano Islands says that: A waste of money! All you do is run back and forth and hit the ball!) I'll be back later with more info.

rating : C-"
1971,2,"This game lacks the depth that the previous games had. With less than two dozens of leaders to start with, it just doesn't have the same feeling like CIV5, where the numerous nations gave a lot to think about when it came to strategies.

Maybe with twice the leaders, the game could get more fun to play with some randomness added to it."
1972,2,"Not compatible with Windows 8.1, therefore, a waste of money."
1973,2,"<-- Graphics -->
The visuals in the game are simply stunning. I've never seen more realistic waterfalls or lightning effects than in this game. Standing on the shore, waves will roll in and darken the sand, which then lightens again once the water recedes. Caves seem infinitely dark until you step inside and your eyes adjust, and likewise, the view outside is overexposed and blinding until you do the same. Square's visual staff produces some simply amazing stuff, and the attention to even the smallest of details adds to the realism of the world. Granted, some might consider the hardware requirements a bit steep to elicit all of this wonderful imagery, but you can't deny, it's a damn pretty game.

<-- Environment -->
While the cities are fine, the outside environment leaves much to be desired. The game right now consists, literally, of three zones, each reminiscent of a primary zone in FFXI, and generally with some elements of other zones thrown in. Unfortunately, while very realistic and well done, the landscapes are devoid of anything... interesting. Very realistic, and very generic, landscapes are what await you.

<-- Sound -->
The sound, both music and effects, are what you'd expect from Square-Enix. Very well done.

<-- Combat -->
Combat classes in this game are defined by the weapon you equip, which sounds very strange at first, but makes more sense once you discover that ""classes"" are arbitrary, and only serve to indicate your level of mastery at whatever skill your main hand item uses. Combat is basically the same as it was in FFXI, with some minor adjustments. Your auto-attacks now aren't, and all of your skills use stamina, which builds up automatically during combat. TP generation (by basic attacks) is much faster, and weapon skills are a much more common element of battle. The game also has a system similar to skillchains, which might see more use if party play was necessary or even encouraged.

<-- Gathering -->
There are three gathering classes, Fisherman, Botanist, and Miner. All three employ the same mini-game (with some minor differences, mostly in terminology) which decides whether or not you've gathered successfully. Once you figure the mechanics out, it's fairly easy to keep yourself from failing repeatedly, and the learning curve is short. However, it doesn't do anything to relieve the tedium of gathering. You may welcome the gathering mini-game as a device to help you stay awake while doing it, or you may view it as just one more unnecessary task to perform in the process.

<-- Crafting -->
Crafting is necessary in this game, for equipment, and for repairs. The system itself is an irritating time sink. While there are different crafting ""methods"" that you can use during the process, it seems to have little to no effect on the outcome of the craft, except where it relates to the assessment of your guildleve work. Most of the time, unless you're well above your craft (by ten or more levels, at least) you will be using the standard method, which will involve sitting there and pressing the ""enter"" key eight or ten times while you wait for the game to decide whether you won the dice roll or not.

There are many crafting ""skills"" which, while not required by a particular craft, may be ""recommended"" for it. You can only acquire these skills through the trading of guild points, and you will suffer a rather severe penalty to the craft without them.

Repairs are one particular element of the game that I found irritating in the extreme. Even though I have friends who play who could effect repairs for me on items they made (and likewise for myself, on items made for them) we found several instances of items crafted that could not be repaired by the crafter, due to a lack of skill. Add to that the fact that we tend to be in numerous different areas, and it makes the whole thing rather inconvenient.

It wouldn't be so inconvenient if performing any sort of activity didn't reduce the durability of your items so quickly, but the biggest culprit here is your underwear, and an hour of intense play will require you to stop, swap it out for a second set that you keep on hand for this purpose only (you can't simply unequip your drawers, no going commando here) to repair. There are repair NPCs that can repair you enough to keep you going (to 75%, you suffer reduced effect at 50%) but on higher-level crafted items, the price is amazingly high for this service. When gathering, be advised to unequip anything that's expensive or not easily repaired.

<-- Economy -->
The economy directly pulls the bazaar system from FFXI. Additionally, in lieu of a mog house or bank system, you're provided with a retainer that can hold as many items as you can, and you're permitted to set this retainer up in a city's market ward, where you can basically bazaar from the NPC. There is no auction house in the game. While I can understand the reasoning behind the lack of it (camping and price-gouging issues), those reasons simply aren't good enough. Nobody wants to spend, quite literally, hours hunting through hundreds of bazaars hoping to ~maybe~ find the item they're looking for (and personally, I adamantly refuse). The abundance of bazaars makes loading agonizingly slow in both areas of town where they're prevalent, and in the market wards.

Bazaars are great for making casual sales. In FFXI, I would check people in the field or at random in towns to see if they had anything I could use, but when looking for something specific that you need, an easily searchable system, like an auction house, is quite simply required. The game's economy is utterly broken, and will remain broken, until this feature is added.

Also, there is no system in place for mail, at all. This feature's exclusion is a huge failure.

<-- Storyline and Questing -->
The storyline, what little exists of it, seems completely disconnected from the rest of the game, and as of yet, the primary storyline is the only quest line that exists in the game. Repeatable guildleves aren't quests so much as a means by which to obtain guild points, and are reset every thirty-six hours on the server's schedule.

Ultimately, this leads to a sense of pointlessness. Without any kind of purpose, you roam the landscape, killing birds, rats, and various other forms of wildlife, improving your combat skills for no particular reason other than raising a number.

<-- Other Thoughts -->
In addition to the oddity of not being able to repair an item that you can craft, there are an unusual number of low-level crafts that require high-level items. So far, ~none~ of the foods I've eaten seem to have any noticeable effect, leading me to wonder if they even HAVE effects yet, or if the developers decided to save that for later. Additionally, there are areas in the game where there are obviously supposed to be guild shops (with guild signs outside of buildings), but no shop exists to enter.

Those along with numerous other factors, leave me with the final impression that the game is simply incomplete, like they needed another month or six to flesh it out before release. I honestly feel like I'm paying to beta test. While it has a lot of nice features, and a lot of potential, and I really, really, really want to like it, I just can't recommend this game to anyone at this point."
1974,2,"I have had this game since the day they release it. I bought this game mostly for the sake of the single player. It was an expensive rip off, and it still is.

PROS: Single Player - The best about this game. Nothing else. Multiplayer's killcams.

CONS: Multiplayer - First, it was fun and all because no one was hacking and everyone was new and honest to the community. Then, hackers started to show up which sabotaged the fun of this game. Now, hackers are everywhere. You are going to expect a hacker or hackers in probably 7/10 games. You can easily identify who is hacking with one or a few killcams. If you are an experience PC gamer, it is even easier to spot who is hacking WITHOUT killcams (i.e. in hardcore modes). Other than hackers, connections are always iffy. IW is really bad. There are more, but I am just too tried to care anymore.

All in all, if you are deciding whether you want to get this game as of this moment, please don't. Save your money and wait for Call of Duty Black Ops that is coming out in November. I can't say it will be a better game but so far it looks promising to me from reviewers."
1975,2,"I was so excited to get my Vita.  I just bought a PS4, and me and my boys were excited to play MLB The Show on both devices.  However, when I received the Vita I found out that you can only use one Playstation Network account on it.  Yeah, you can use multiple accounts if you jump through hoops (use separate memory cards and reset the Vita to factory settings every time and then go through the setup again). I thought it would be so great for someone to use the PS4 and then if someone else needed the TV they could continue to play on the Vita.  I can only think that they don't allow switching to other accounts to force people to buy multiple Vita's in each household.  No thanks."
1976,2,"I wasn't too excited about MOP after playing the beta.  Finally downloaded it after I uninstalled GW2 after a few weeks and have now leveled up two of my toons to 90 and have one in 469 item level gear.  I have played this game for years and years, and quit several times due to boredom and whatever else.  Here is a rundown of what I think of the game and rating for each category I think important:

Panderia!  4 of 5 stars.  As far as wow goes, its the best looking set of zones they have made.  As far as everyone else, its kinda bleh.  The cartoony graphics are fine, they are what they have been for the last eight years.  I was kind of dissapointed with the re-use of so many mob models they have been using for so many years, but they have added quite a bit of new stuff.  The areas are all very nicely done, and large.  Lots to explore, very oriental in feeling, and the quest hubs - while overall nothing very exciting (kill 10 of these and then 10 more of those!) are varied enough to not get overly tedious before you hit 90.  They also added pandas as a race to play which look fine, but not something I get too excited about.

Player dynamics.  3 of 5 stars.  I play a mage/warrior/hunter as my three main toons, though I have several other 85s.  The talent system was changed dramatically from cata with the replacing of the trees with the new tier system.  Overall they have done a fairly decent job with the talents and there are a few trees that its fun to try different abilities for different fights.  Overall though, its primarily the same talent in three different formats.  DPS talents all do primarily the same dps - they just look different when used.  Also many core talents that used to be specific to a spec on a class are now in the tier.  So many specs seemed to have lost a bit - yet they have gained a little as well since oftentimes you can now use abilities that used to be restricted to another spec.  My fire mage can now use ice shield and my assassination rogue can use shadowstep.  It mixes it up a bit, which is a nice change.  Leveling however, IMO went down the toilet.  I have tried leveling a monk... and I just loose interest.  Since you cannot make any decisions except once every 15 levels, it doesnt really seem like you accomplish much when you gain a level or two.  Often the lower level tiers on the new talent system have talents that don't really impact your character much so it can be very underwhelming.  I find though, with my mage which is best geared main atm, that I stick with the same abilities 95% of the time.  Its also fundamentally the same abilities that I use from cata and before.  While there have been a few tweaks, the character just seems... tired.  I think its just because I have been playing the game for so many years and the overall wow combat system to me is showing some years.  Same set of buttons.. same rotation... over and over and over...  So three stars.

Max Level dynamics.  1 of 5 stars.  Wow... why one star???  The new LFR is fine, the bosses look great and are different and so far a few weeks in still fun to do.  The world bosses are ok, a nice change and fun as well.  The thing blizz added that for me is almost a game breaker is how you progress your toon.  In this game, you get gear at level 90 to progress.  You can go do your weekly LFR - maybe an hour or two and your done.  You can do your world boss or two, and another hour.  You can also gain rep with factions and buy valor gear.  This is where for me the game goes down the big toilet bowl of crappy game design.  One huge complaint with cataclysim was there was no incentive to get out in the world.  Everyone sat in the cities and spamed nonsense in trade chat and qued for runs.  Fine, it was bad and they tried to fix it.  Get players out in the world!  WOOO!  Except... to get that valor gear you have to grind dailies to get enough rep with that faction to be able to purchase them.  Revered with this faction for your shoulders.  Honored with these guys for you epic crafting pattern.  Honored with this faction before you can start doing dailies with that other faction to get your legs at revered.  The bummer of it all is that there is no other game mechanic to gain rep other than doing dailies.  If dailies aren't your thing... then your screwed.  You can gain a bit of rep out in the zones by doing the zone quests, but they will not get you enought to get the great gear at the higher levels.  They took out the reputation tabbards and your stuck with... dailies.  Now I enjoyed the heck out of tol borad like alot of other people.  I also liked some of the daily hubs they had with sunwell and a few others.  But I didn't feel like I was falling behind with my guild if I didn't do them for a day or week.  With these... hey, you want to dps on the normal raid runs??  Why don't you have your revered gear yet?  Well... you just lost your spot.  So each night after work, log in, and several hours of the exact same quests you have done for each night for weeks... and tonight I just shut off the game and said to heck with it.  I am so sick of the game already and its only been a few weeks.  I have only partially geared one toon and I cannot take anymore of this grindy daily nonsense.  Its the worst I have seen it in eight years and I don't know now if I will start up again after my annual wears out in DEC.  I cannot imagine at this time even leveling up another of my 85s because at the end of that decently done leveling process is that horrid rep grind nonsense.  If blizz would have given people the OPTION of gaining rep through tabbards and heroic dungeon runs like in cata, this wouldn't be so bad.

So in the end you have a fairly decent leveling process to get to 90 and after a few weeks your stuck doing a few hours of LFR / world bosses hoping you get a purple so you don't have to grind rep with some faction for hours until your ready to throw your comp out the window.  Cataclysim had many issues and overall was kind of dissapointing.  This one was ok at first, and is quickly loosing its appeal.  So two stars for me - they added some decent stuff, but overall MOP is very repetitive, grindy, and underwhelming."
1977,2,"It's not like I didn't try to like this game.  I wanted to love this game. I really, really did.  I've been waiting for a space exploration game for some time.  I wanted to see a game like this; a game where you go from planet to planet meeting strange aliens and odd landscapes.  I wanted to see big and sprawling alien cities inhabited by players and NPCs alike.

The planet's I've been too have been A) Barren, B)Boring, C) Mind-Meltingly BORING.  This is trying to be Minecraft in Space but fails miserably.  You collect resources but all you can build is technology or recharging your equipment.  Wouldn't it be cool to build your own house or manufacturing facility?  To sell useless crap to other players? Oh yeah there aren't any players because there's way too many planets so the chances of meeting other players is like winning the lottery.  I'm not even sure you can meet other players.

All you do is explore space and uninteresting worlds following a vague story about something called Atlas.  I haven't yet run into any of the Atlas Interfaces and I'm on the fence about playing it again because I'm bored out of my mind.  I can't bring myself playing it for a full hour (which is usual for my playing sessions unless the game is blowing me away) .  I really wanted to love this game but it's disappointing

The one thing I did like was you can name your discoveries.

The game tells you what to do next like find a resource but doesn't tell you where to find that specific resource.  The game tells you absolutely nothing else.

The game was ambitious but failed to deliver"
1978,2,"PROS
-The leveling experience is amazing
-Lots of quests, bonus quests, and companion quests
-Great stories
-Each class has its own story line

CONS
-No end game whatsoever
-PVP is broken and needs a LOT of improvement to be viable at level 50

It's the world's greatest Massive SINGLE Online Role Playing Game."
1979,2,"Please note this is someone who love the Tomb Raider series. I have never seen a game Tomb Raider game like this one before. Usually Tomb Raider games are extremely interactive, it feels like you're in the game doing the stunts, etc. This game feels like one of those old skool video games like the 1980s version of Super Mario Brothers when you would run to a power pellet and it would should you that you just got 100 points Seriously a disappointment. The only reason I gave it 2-stars was because in the category of pacman-eesque games, the graphics are great. However, I would avoid this game all together and just get Tomb Raider Definitive edition or something.. If you do order this game, you have been warned."
1980,2,"Prey. Nothing really stands out as excellent in this game. The main draw being the ability to take on the abilities of your enemies. The shooting mechanics are below average, lacking a basic Aim Down Sights mechanic. It's a game where you don't really need to stay on task. You're not on rails, and can do things pretty out of order. Unfortunately, if you want to run around and explore, you're going to spend a lot of time backtracking while doing the actual missions. Not usually a big deal, but the load times are terrible. Going between areas takes almost two minutes, and because of how many areas there are, you spend a lot of time looking at loading screens. Another frustrating part is the anti-gravity areas. You can leave the space station, but orientation is a big problem. I've played other games where you can press a button and it puts you at a default orientation, but there is no default orientation and you spend a lot of time lost. Adding salt to the wounds, with all of the choices you get to make in the game, there's only one ending. It's the illusion of deciding your fate."
1981,2,Only reason I give it two star is for cost&quality. Other than that the shipping took 52 days to come what?? Yes that long I sent like 3 emails to talk with them and soo on. I was pissed!!
1982,2,this was the game that was supposed to build up the story to bring a closure to the series which was suppose to be re7 but instead ppl cry about this change not understanding the story that they not only change resident evil completely and the original concept to re7 so badly that it's unrecognizable my only issues for this game is the gameplay even tho its improved and no longer using tank controls my issues are the camera move way too much also automatic reload doesn't work u still have to do it manually even after changing it also there's a lot more goofy than  characters/enemies than re5 and he (ragdoll) hit detection makes u fall down even more than that operations raccoon city garbage which makes it even more harder to play at times this change is good bcuz theres no tank controls but the bad thing is that this game needs a lot more improvements and mercenary mode is worst mode in this entire game i feel like capcom ruined it the hardest stage is the first one they spawn way too many enemy types that can take all or even half your life bar wit one hit and there's too many quick time events and there's times u have to move analog stick when a dog is on u and no matter how many times u wiggle free u still take massive damage sometimes your whole life bar i hate the fact that capcom thought b.o.w.s which is one of the new enemy types have weapons thats one of the reason why the movies took this direction to bring more action instead of horror i blame capcom for introducing this crap to the series not knowing what to do with this franchise after the creator of resident evil Shinji Mikami lefted crapcom so when ppl blame the movies for not following the games they actually was but due to the fact that capcom ruined it so much and so badly that they or some so called fans don't even recognize what have been already introduced to the series that was from the games that was added into the movies this is why the movies was action based instead of horror but all that is another story so to in this review if u don't like tank controls and want to play something new than this is the game for u just note that there's gonna be minor issues with with including ridiculous new enemy types but if u don't mind that than all means get this game there's lots of mutiplayer modes including playing as a zombie aka b.o.w.s honestly thats one of the best thing capcom has ever done oh and i forgot to also say that the driving mechanics is terrible! its one of the worst part of this game every new thing thats been added failed so bad that it fall right on its face
1983,2,"Sniper: Ghost Warrior had the potential to be a great game, but sadly ended up being a complete failure.

Difficulty: The majority of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is ridiculously easy, however, it's littered with painfully frustrating points all throughout the game.

Variety of Environments/Mission Types: The entire game is in a tropical jungle environment, but you will come across some industrial environments. As far as mission types go, there is a nice variety. In one mission you may be sneaking through an enemy camp, in another you will be a spotter for a friendly sniper, in some you might be taking down high value targets at long range.

Weapon/Equipment Variety: In Sniper: Ghost Warrior there are only four sniper rifles, a couple of assault rifles, as well as one shotgun. There are also a few pieces of equipment. There is a near useless grappling hook, C4 you can only use in two parts of the game, and binoculars you get to use for about four minutes.

Graphics: This game has about average graphics, although the rain forest looks pretty nice.

Sounds: Most sound effects are pretty good, although the voice acting gives me suicidal thoughts.

Campaign: The campaign is the best part of Sniper: Ghost Warrior; and the campaign sucks. The enemies can see you from far away while you are prone in a bush, the AI is stupid, and everything is painfully glitchy. Some parts of the game are barely passable due to getting stuck behind a rock.

Multiplayer: Really, Sniper: Ghost Warrior's multiplayer is a joke. It takes multiple shots with any sniper rifle to kill someone unless you get a headshot, and the ghillie suits do little or no good.

The Verdict: Unless you want to blow $40 on a piece of junk, do NOT buy this game. City Interactive would have to majorly overhaul this game if they wanted it to be any good. 2/10"
1984,2,"It is a decent product, it's well built and I didn't have any trouble installing it on my laptop. The problems arose while I was actually using it though. I use Xbox controllers with ePSXe, PJ64, and a few other emulators, and while a corded controller gave me no problem with those, my wireless controller is constantly getting dropped by this. It's a nuisance that I think is entirely hardware related. I should have purchased an OEM receiver instead of this, or another corded controller."
1985,2,"UPDATE: So, I'm going to leave my review but please don't let it count against the product itself in your eyes.  I ended up going with a different headset and it was much more to my liking.  The turtle beach PX22.  It was cheaper but wired and still met all my needs and beyond.  After comparing the two, feel wise, I am so glad I ended up with the PX22 as it is in my opinion a superior design and much more comfortable fit.

I received this a day early and was excited as I had plans to use it over the weekend for a gaming event.  I would have docked this one star at least from the get go as I guess I have a small head but the tension is not great enough for this headset in my opinion.  The wideness of it makes it so it doesn't seal all the way around my ears.

That being said, my review isn't on the headset performance itself but the proprietary charger that it comes with.  Mine actually didn't come with a charger at all, so my guess is a owner of one of these purchased this just to take the charger out of it and returned it.  That being said, I left it to charge over 3 hours with a similar cable in a different charger and it refused to boot up at all.  It would have the red light of charging but then wouldn't stay on.

I returned it next day.  Because I really needed something for the event this weekend, I plan to stop by a local best buy and just deal with the increased cost.  I hope to come back and change the review to 4 stars."
1986,2,"Okay, okay, I know that many have already cited this complaint, but I'm here to provide my version of the story. I was thrilled to actually see a Square Enix RPG that had an open-world map since there aren't too many of those anymore, but the story repeating itself on the second half was like a painful slap to the face.

SPOILERS START
--------------------------------------------------------
What is extremely ridiculous is that if you want to see the ""true"" ending, you must go through the crystal bosses *five* times, yes, you have heard me, five times, and the fact that I already awakened the crystals once should have been enough, but no, you must be in pain while playing this, and get punished for making progress in the game, which is really awful. I do not know what the developers were high on, but it is very clear that they haven't thought through what the player would feel once he or she has realized that one must play through the exact same song and dance again to get any additional benefits to the plot holes if you do.
-----------------------------------------------------------
SPOILERS END
-----------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, this game could have been amazing, but really blew everything up that was awesome about the game halfway through, which I have never had happen before. I've played RPGs that were difficult all the way through, or RPGs that varied in difficulty, but never had I played an RPG that forces you to essentially play the game twice. I think I'm going to wash away the rotten taste of this with the good old 90's era RPGs that Square made back when they were their own company, and didn't resort to playing tricks like this on the player or compress the game with incredibly small areas with no world maps. Yeah, I think I'm going to play Final Fantasy IV, thank you very much..."
1987,2,"I'm vacillating between two or three stars on this game so maybe it should be two and a half. The story is pretty obvious - Jack the Ripper or a copycat is in New York in 1901 killing off prostitutes in what the game calls the ""Lowside District"" of New York. Why in the world the developers decided to call lower Manhattan the Lowside District is beyond me. Or why the Pinkerton detective agency is called the ""Pinterten"" Detective agency. Or why a deranged raven shows up at the crime scene of a couple of the murders and then disappears until the very end of the game when you hear the words, ""Nevermore, nevermore."" What's Poe got to do with this game? They even have a story line about the World Series which didn't even exist in 1901.
OK, but all that aside what drove me the most crazy about this game was that it was very linear. You have to keep going back over the same locations over and over because something wasn't done in the correct order. In the final chapter I ended up visiting every location three times. The only positive note is that navigation is easy. It you want to leave a location, just right-click and the map comes up so that you can visit another spot - again and again.
The graphics are pretty good. There's really isn't an abundance of dialogue but the acting is fine. The music is something I rarely pay attention to - in fact if there is an option to turn it down I usually do because it interferes with the speaking voices and I find it annoying. This game did not have that option and there was only one time that the music was a problem. There really aren't any puzzles - just when to use inventory items in the right place at the right time. They were pretty straight forward. There was one timed sequence in the morgue that I actually thought was kind of a bit of sick humor - I had to use a walkthough for it. I never would have figured it out myself.
After all that - the ending. It was terrible. Absolutely awful. All that detective work (reporter work actually)for nothing. I expected some big confrontation between the reporter and the villain or the heroine to be in actual danger and saved by the reporter - nope. Nothing, except a stupid, ""Nevermore, nevermore."""
1988,2,Weak - I just don't want to play this game. Every time that I think it couldn't get any worse... you guessed it! Nothing comes together and each new element of the game seems to be a slap in the face. It is just plain stupid to go around working with a disjointed scenario like this. Not Fun!
1989,2,Why 2 stars instead of 1? See. It gets two stars because the endings are different and the game's intro is better than part 3. Other than that.............it can be overlooked by you.
1990,2,"(8 MONTHS LATER UPDATE)

What was EA thinking when they released this game.  I've played it intensely for about 7 months now.  (And I'm pretty wicked at it).  The previous games were so much more fun, as a boarding game shoud be.  EA has tried to make this game realistic and challenging and all they managed to do was make it overly difficult and frustrating.

My complaints:

#1) Game play is not that good. I feel as if I have no control over the boarder. It seems they go where they want to go, not where you want them to go. It's easy to miss certain paths, rails, and  tunnels. The controls are not as precise as the previous games.  And to make matters worse, you have to deal with:

#2)  The incredibly convoluted tracks.  There's way to much clutter for you run into...on every track.  Trees, extremely narrow passages, rocks, crags, cliffs, small tunnels that you can barely jump in but lose your bonus in if you don't jump, holes into oblivion, and dark tunnels. It would've been nice to have a few wide-open tracks.  Try making it down one of these courses with a hard-to-control boarder, while dealing with:

#3)  Oxygen Tanks, Thermal Protection, Armor, Headlamps, Pulse Goggles, and Wingsuits.  A bunch of features no one really cares about.  (well, the wingsuits are kinda cool)

And let me tell you how I know no one cares about them:  I play online with quite a number of people.  No one tends to bother with those tracks requiring you wear one of these features. It's just too much work, and after 6months, there are still tracks that I can't finish. Where's the entertainment in that?  People just want to enjoy themselves and EA has dropped the ball.

Regarding Mt: Eddie.  You can get it if you blow another $7.99.  I got it and it's very entertaining.  Lots of open room, rails, and insane jumps. Reminiscent of SSXTricky and SSX3.  I personally recommend it.  Too bad the rest of the game is not as fun.

IMO, this game is geared more toward a continual for those who have played the other SSX games.  I think first-timers are in for a difficult challenge."
1991,2,"The triggers and bumpers feel pretty awkward. The d-pad is far superior to the 360 controller, though. That is, it was until mine broke. It works most of the time, but sometimes I have to push certain directions extra hard in order for it to register. I think I'm just going to get a 360 controller with the d-pad that rotates for a slightly better experience."
1992,2,"Graphics & gameplay were terrible on the Xbox One.  I'd bought this for the hubby and he hates it.  I've known quite a few people who bought it and loved it, which is why I got it for his birthday, but he found it to be a big let-down compared to the original ones."
1993,2,"I knew this wasn't going to be amazing but the first game was decent and for a Spider-Man fan it was fun game. This is not the first game, I quit very early on after seeing the combat to be not very good and the upgrade system also pretty sparse. It just falls flat. I don't understand why this wasn't an improved version of the first game, I would recommend the first game but would have to say pass on The Amazing Spider-Man 2."
1994,2,"I was looking forward to the story.  But after having finished Mars War Logs and The Walking Dead not to much before that, the interface on Bully for what should have been a similar game just down right stinks.  It is too bad really.  The cut scenes are good.  The acting has been well done for each character I have met so far.  All very good stereotypes.  But its a real big bummer when you get back to working your character because the port is so bad.  There are other issues too, notably that for me the sound does not work right.  Once the game starts, I cannot adjust the sound volume from my hot keys.  A problem for me when the wife complains.

I will make an effort to play it some more and give it a fair chance but at the moment I cannot recommend it for any reason.  I bet this was a cool game on the console, but it is another excellent example how porting games from console to PC can go real bad.

Hail Flavius!"
1995,2,If you like getting stuck in games where your team is getting chrushed so bad you cant even spawn and if you leave the game youll get banned
1996,2,"I ordered this expecting a particular model that worked but unfortunately it turned out to be a generic knockoff that barely does anything. The one that you may be looking for comes with an LED inside and a mini-cd for driver installation. This one doesn't and there is only a brand name if you dig deep into the hardware information. The brand name wasn't the same as what was listed on the site and so I would avoid purcahsing from Hottestdealever for that reason.

There have been many complaints and it's like a hit and miss. If you value your money and time then I would suggest not playing a game of russian roulette and to just buy the official $20 model SKU: 01056-4 by sony.

I do enjoy both xbox 360 and ps2 controllers and love how there's a choice for what game you want to play. Unfortunately that choice cannot be done with this broken adapter. I can only use a few buttons and I have done my research and there is no fix for this. It has to be the original version not the generic one that some resellers sell.

I'm sorry if I only rated 2 stars as I never do (look at my history) however I could not confirm whether or not there's a better model and this particular one was terrible, not a defect. Good luck with your decision and purchase!"
1997,2,"Having played 3 other Gh games before this one Legends of Rock,Guitar Hero 5 and Warriors of Rock  i can honestly say that this is the worst Gh game i have played,i don't know how they did it but the makers of this game managed to take away pretty much everything that made these games fun,gone are the cartoon graphics of the previous games,gone are the rock and heavy metal songs replaced with music that in my opinion is horrible and also gone is the older different colored button layout on the guitar replaced with a new layout that in my opinion is cramped and uncomfortable to play...in wrapping up this review i will suggest that any fans of the older games just skip this one, they wrecked the formula it just isn't the same anymore."
1998,2,"Only used it like two times kind of pointless, but kids like it I suppose."
1999,2,Did not work for my computer I was and still am very sad.... They will probubly remove this revew though.
2000,3,"This game should have been
an expansion pack to Sim Theme Park - and priced as such - as it's
hardly a sequel.  If there are any major differences or improvements,
I haven't found them yet.  You have three themed areas to choose from
(Sim Theme Park had five) and you climb the corporate ladder by
developing your park with various rides, managing your staff, and
completing challenges that will ultimately allow you to progress to
the next themed area.  The system requirements are steeper in this
game and the load times are excruciating.  Don't listen to the box, you'll need at least a P350 and even then only if you have a
fast video card or you'll be struggling.  If you do decide to change
the screen resolution, the game shuts down without giving you the
option to save your park first - a very irritating
annoyance.
Another annoyance is the constantly yapping announcer
(you think Bullfrog would've listened to all the complaints people
were making in Sim Theme Park).  For instance, one of the challenges
involves increasing the attendance by a certain percentage.  To do
this you may decide to lower the entry price (hey, maybe I'm not
Michael Eisner and I don't want to gouge my customers!)  Unfortunately
this will cause the announcer to annoy you over and over that your
entry price is too low.  Or maybe you've researched all the rides and
attractions you can build.  Doesn't matter, it'll yap incessantly that
you need to put your scientists to work to the point where you want to
slap its little blue face.
The rides don't differ much from one
area to the next; another consistent complaint about Sim Theme Park.
I don't find fault in this as most amusement park rides really aren't
much different from one another, but it would've been nice to see
Bullfrog step up to the plate and offer unique rides that violate the
laws of physics in the real world.  One problem I ran into in this
""sequel"" involves the potential of rides interfering with
one another.  In the first park, I built a rollercoaster next to a
large rock formation.  Unbenownest to me I found out this rock
formation later became a ride I needed to build.  Unfortunately, there
was no way of making this happen without completely destroying my
existing rollercoaster at considerable expense.
The last major gripe
for some involves the gameplay itself.  It's very evident the
developers did not want to make this complex to the point where you
felt like a Harvard Business grad by the time you finish.  Instead the
focus is more on putting out fires minute to minute while still having
time to enjoy the fruits of your labor.  You can adjust the speed of
the gameplay so it can be as slow-paced or as frantic as you want and
this function works well.  Many people will be put off by the lack of
""sim"" in Sim Coaster, but now you can't complain because I
warned you in advance, right?  Also, the AI of your staff seems to
have improved considerably - puke doesn't dry for four hours on the
sidewalk like it did in the last game.
The area where this game
shines is simple - camcorder mode.  With a click of the mouse, you get
to see the park and ride your coasters in first-person view as if you
were a visitor instead of the overhead ""God mode"" view.
After spending an hour carefully designing every twist and loop,
riding your creation is a nice reward for your efforts and a lot of
fun.  You even get to see the other shops and rides you've built from
the view of the front car as well as hear the kids screaming as you do
the triple corkscrew.  Again, this was in Sim Theme Park and nothing
much has changed.  It would've been nice if they added the ability to
actually go into the shops or play the sideshow games.  A nice
improvement to this game is you can design the coasters in advance,
then place them fully formed in your park later.
I still think Sim
Theme Park was revolutionary for its time but the lack of significant
improvements make me a little more critical this time around.  Hope my
review helped."
2001,3,"This is a review for the game itself and the contents within, NOT a review on how well it runs/installs/plays.

After extensively playing with Rocksmith and my new guitar for about a year, I have a lot to say about Rocksmith itself that I've learned from spending a lot of time with it.

If you're a beginner, this is a wonderful tool to help you get started. It'll teach you all of the terms, techniques, and give you decent lessons on different forms of playing. The lessons are a must if you're to learn anything from Rocksmith as a beginner. However, while some of the lessons are helpful and in-depth, others don't go into enough detail. They do spell things out for you and explain things pretty well, but when you screw up on the playing part of the lesson, it'll tell you that you did something wrong... but it won't tell you what. This, for a beginner, can completely suck the fun out of learning. It's like a teacher smacking your hand and saying ""no, do it again,"" without telling you why you screwed up.

Now, when you screw up the actual songs, that's another story. When the song is finished, it'll say, after giving you your score, what you had trouble with and where you should go to improve your skill in that area. Why the lessons don't have these kind of instructions baffles me, but it can make for a very frustrating experience. I swear, some of the lessons I got correct were from pure luck, and after doing it over and over and over again, and the game telling me I failed over and over, I never know coming out of the lessons what I did differently from all of the other times I failed and what made me succeed the attempt. The game won't tell you these things. You have to figure it out on your own. That's especially where Rocksmith falls really flat for me. It's a good teaching TOOL... but it CANNOT replace a teacher. If you're really devoted to learning guitar, especially to play and write your own stuff, you need a teacher or various other methods of learning other than just Rocksmith.

As I've probably made clear... this isn't good enough to teach you how to play guitar WELL. It teaches you to cover songs that already exist. You could solo play some old tunes at parties to impress your buddies, but it's not as good at teaching you the why and how you play certain notes at certain times. Some of the guitarcade games help your reflexes and help you understand better, and they teach you good finger placement for certain notes and chords. But it isn't at all like being in school or having an actual teacher. There's no one there to tell you what certain scales are, what notes and chords are in the scales (even Scale Warriors didn't help me memorize it well enough, since you have to progress through the game to even understand the other scales), what key to play in and why... so I feel like when stepping away from Rocksmith, I have no idea how to tune my guitar for a certain song. Only in Rocksmith am I able to play the way I do, and I feel that it's become more of a handicap than anything. I just change my tuning for whatever the game tells me to and then I play the song. It gets old and unrewarding.

The guitarcade, however, is really fun and actually pretty helpful. I found it more helpful than the songs. Castle Chordead frustrated me beyond belief, however. Again, I always feel like I'm doing exactly what the game tells me, and it somehow fails anyway. It could be my guitar, could be my fret board, could be the way the guitar rests on me... could be any number of things. The game's not going to tell you what that is. Again, you have to figure it out on your own unless you have a teacher.

So I suppose my biggest gripe with Rocksmith is that it'll tell you that you failed, and you'll feel like you're doing exactly what it tells you, but you screw up anyway somehow. I don't know if it's me or the game itself. Either way, it makes it hard to want to keep playing with the game... or learn the guitar.

The good thing about Rocksmith is that it encourages people to start learning a new instrument, which is something I always advocate. As I've said before, it's great for beginners wanting to start out. By now, however, I've grown tired of the game, and angry with it. I feel I haven't gotten anywhere whatsoever, or progressed in the way I wanted to. I rely on the game to play, and I don't want that. I want to be able to play when not connected to a video game. It's made me dependent on it.

I feel sad to say that at this point, I don't know how to feel about Rocksmith. I want to say I had some really fun times with it, because I did. But I don't feel like I'm learning as much as I could, and I don't feel like I could progress beyond being a karaoke guitarist, or ""gamer guitarist,"" so to speak. I have nothing against video games-- I am a obsessive gamer outside of Rocksmith. But maybe that's my problem. It feels like Guitar Hero, and I didn't like Guitar Hero as a game. Did I learn a lot with Rocksmith? Absolutely. I learned much more about guitars in my time with it than I would have on my own. Did I learn as much as I wanted to? Not really. Except to play already existing songs. I couldn't solo to save my life, or write my own music, which was my goal. Just play those same songs repeatedly like a broken down jukebox.

I would, however, recommend this to anyone starting out. It can really rejuvenate you and get your creativity and get your musical side flowing. Just be aware that there may come a time when Rocksmith doesn't do it for you anymore. There are many Youtube channels that are just guitar lessons every day. That'd be a good place to carry on if you're not going to hire a tutor. Is Rocksmith a bad program/game? Not at all. It did help me to some extent. But it might help some better than others."
2002,3,again amazon had a handel on where to find a classic nes game. DK was my favorite game in the 80's but failed to concor the 4th level. going to try again. wish me luck. ps: got a greate knock off emulator from amazon also.  ;)
2003,3,7yr old played it the first week we got but hasn't played it since
2004,3,as the 1st and 2nd on N64.= You just have more guys and a little better graphics
2005,3,"I don't know what I expected from this game going in. I have full experience with almost all of the previous titles. For some reason, this game was as let down to me, which is really sad because it's not because the game messed up. It just failed to live up to the hype."
2006,3,Could be great
2007,3,"1 Player mode sounded fun, and that the storyline might be intriguing, but it didn't really turn out very fun.. I know that is probably what James Bond is all about.. but I really don't get any enjoyment out of shooting people right and left.. But not only that, it is hard to aim, a lot of wasted shots and a lot of your life meter lost while trying to lock onto your target, and the levels become repetitive. James doesn't run fast enough in this game. I have given the 1 Player mode chance after chance, kept playing it and never cared for it that well, not to mention it is really hard. (Not that I am exceptionally good at James Bond games in the first place)

Multiplayer mode.. Very fun.. that is if you have someone to play against, I really don't and that's a shame because one of the reasons I bought NightFire was because I played Golden Eye's multiplayer with others and that was loads of fun. (Multiplayer mode in Golden Eye was/is much better than multiplayer in NightFire.)

Anyway, I suggest renting the game before you buy it. And when you do complete it (if) I doubt you will play it over again.. for me, very poor replay value.

So, i'm not a fan of the game but i'll let you make your own decision.. rent it first!"
2008,3,Don't waste your time don't like the graphics don't expect much 720 is the highest xbox one will go. Ps4 will have 1080
2009,3,"I remember playing this way back when it came out, but just barely. I do remember it was fun though. Then years later, I decided to play it again for nostalgic reasons. It was ok, but just like with a lot of other ps1 games, the graphics are a little too pixelated. Also it's hard to move on to the next levels. It was a great experience to play an old ps1 game, but I wouldn't pick this one to re-visit."
2010,3,"I liked it enough to play it all the way through [and i have no patients for games and will drop them on day one if they're not up to par] this game is short, which, for me in this game is a plus, because if it had gone on for much longer I would have eventually gotten bored of it not long after.  But, it's a fun game, at a great price. [just no GOD OF WAR!!!!!!]"
2011,3,Worked great for a week after that wouldn't hold a charge I had to take it apart and replace my battery
2012,3,"This game is a blast, the actual game play is very enjoyable. However, I have to deduct a few stars due to the awful 30 frames per second of the cut scenes. I mean, come on, why make a game for a system that it cannot handle? Either tone down the graphics to speed up the frame count, or just don't release the game! For me, it almost makes the cut scenes so annoying that they're almost unwatchable, and I do like hearing the story as I go, this is a major problem, I hope this gets fixed somehow with a future download."
2013,3,"This game really did not excite me that much. I found MW2 much more interesting than this. In this game, you cannot low/high crawl at all, the lowest position you get it crouch. Additionally, the map seemed vast, but you are limited to only a very small lane to do your missions. The weapons are also another flaw of this game. The best thing about this game was the incredible graphics and the environment."
2014,3,"We ordered Spectrobes and Spectrobes beyond the Portals........... My grandson perfered ""Beyond the Portals"".......and would recommend this one to anyone 11 years old or older.
S. George"
2015,3,"I like chessmaster in general, and was looking forward to this game for the DS. Unfortunately, it didn't have the library of classic games that I saw advertised in places, nor are there any advanced teaching lessons.
Other reviews go more in depth about some of the shortcomings (seriously... no over-the-internet play??), but there are also some other bothersome design choices.
One example is that you have to choose your language every time you start the game. Then you have to touch the screen to start. Then you choose your profile. It seems that if you started with the profile screen, then you could avoid the others... Oh well.
To be honest, the only reason I gave the game three stars instead of two stars is because there's no other chess games for the DS, and I'm glad to finally have one."
2016,3,"I bought this game because the critics said they used COD4 engine but Its not showing all the best features of COD4 game, then in multiplayer its difficult to find someone to play, almost nobody I would say., single player is very good, so much fun but that's it.and everything is a great copy of the movie.graphics and effects are great."
2017,3,was that just ok
2018,3,"The graphics on this are good and the story could have been great, however the repetitive gameplay and slight variances in enemies make it boring."
2019,3,"I enjoy playing this game.  It's really fun, especially if your're playing with your friends online.  The vehicle mechanics are terrible, it is really bad, just as bad as gta III, maybe even worse.  It also has tailing quests, so far I counted tailing mission, but it isn't as tedious as the tailing missions of other games.  Your character's gear are completely customizable, tons of unlockable weapons and weapon mods.  I do recommend this game."
2020,3,"So far this is a fun game... but is very strange. Thee combat system is overcomplicated, but not too hard to get down. What drives me insane if trying to get resonance points up by repetitively passing through the other 2 characters (You play all 3, turn based) while keeping enough space that they will have room to tri-attack. And sometimes you can just get unlucky and it not give back a hero action, which will get you killed. Also if there is a way to figure out enemy weakness other than  looking it up in town after beating them I haven't found it. And if you enter an area you aren't quite ready for (and it does not give warning) it sometimes locks you in and the only way to get out is load the last save. (Which can be hours of gameplay lost since it can only be done at certain areas.)The graphics are pretty much PS2 quality as well... really bad. And then there is stupid stuff like only being able to turn a quest in during night or during day.

The combat certainly is interesting though, so far I like the characters but there isn't much story yet, and the path clearing with energy things is kind of neat as well."
2021,3,"Firstly I definitely do not advise purchasing this game at its $50 asking price, wait for it to go down. This ""sequel"" feels more like any other Xtreme Legends Expansion then It does a followup, the price doesn't feel as justified as Dynasty Warriors 8 XL Complete either which had more new characters, more new stages, more new unique events (lubu conquering china) more new music, more new modes, better framerate & graphics then on ps3, and an english dub. 4-II does offer some new content, but it does not feel like a genuine sequel or night and day difference such as Final Fantasy 10-2, Final Fantasy 4 After Years, Metal Gear Solid 2, Kingdom Hearts 2, Pikmin 2, Tekken 2, Resident Evil 2, etcetc.

It is still a fun romp however, the swift, flashy & diverse gameplay, colorful graphics, battle objectives, being able to play as 2 characters with simple commands & incredibly distinguished cast of characters are some of the reasons why I am a little more partial to Samurai Warriors then Dynasty Warriors. In the way of new content Naomasa Ii is also a nice addition to the roster, the 13 character based story modes  (where you can now only select 1 other character alongside an automatic primary character) bring some depth to the cast, survival mode is decent fun albeit pretty repetitious more then anything that koei has put into one of their games lately. Graphics are also a bit more tweeked & prettier here then the original SW4, prebattle cinematics have also been tweeked with slightly more drama thanks to characters no longer having as much limited animation/emotion and with more camera movement.

And probably the last noteworthy bit is how dialogue boxes have been moved down towards the very (v-e-r-y) bottom of screens during gameplay, and while it didn't necessarily interfere with battles in the first SW4 atleast i had a much better understanding of what was happening, but here is where an english dub would greatly benefit so i do not have to look down and read and then out of nowhere i could be attacked by the enemy and potentially have my health drained by quite a bit. (A good english dub is not impossible either, Dynasty Warriors 7 was well directed and acted). Or at the very least move the dialogue boxes up further so i can read while playing more easily.

Overall KoeiTecmo could learn from a company like XSeed Games who tend to release full games at budget $30-$50 prices with generally every game of theirs containing free physical bonus goods (that don't hike up the initial price by an extra $20-$30) as well as dual english and japanese audio and little to no dlc. But it is definitely not hindreded by all the above, if you enjoy the hack & slash genre or Samurai Warriors then you should play 4-II. Overall i'd probably rate Samurai Warriors 4-II more of a 3.5 out of 5 (7 out of 10) if I could."
2022,3,I had high hopes for this game but it fell short of my expectations. My biggest complaint is its brevity. I finished this game in about 6-7 hours total on the normal difficulty level. That is just not enough game time for the cost of this game. The graphics and sound are great but the play is almost identical to the other COD titles. The AI is mediocre. I am a big fan of all WWII shooters but this title falls short. I will give credit to the voice overs. This feature did add a bit more of a human element to the game. I recommend renting this game before buying.
2023,3,"Allow me to begin by saying that I bought this on a Black Friday sale at Best Buy for $25, and thank god that I did.  Had I purchased it at a full $60 I would be infuriated at the quality of the game.
As most people have said, the graphics are sub-par to say the least.  They look like some of the higher end PS2 games that I've played.  The animations, when they aren't bogged down by a depressing amount of frame rate drops, are pretty good.  However, there are moments in combat when I'm doing finishers and the opponent appears above me, when Uruks morph through walls, and things of that sort.  Mostly annoying things.  Another one of the major faults is the audio.  In regards to music, the score sounds good and I would love to give it a good listen... if the audio could stop skipping every time I get into a battle.  There is little to no lip syncing to dialogue in game (the cut scenes look gorgeous, but they are obviously separate videos playing) witch really kills the immersion.
Gameplay-wise, it is effectively Batman: Arkham Origins in a Middle Earth setting.  The premise is great, and I really really wish I had a PS4 to experience it in all of its glory.
The most annoying thing about this title is the loading screens.  My.  God.  You cannot even go back to the game from any of the menus without it needing 10-15 seconds to load.  That doesn't seem like much, until you realize just how much you really need to use the menus.  And unlike some other titles that try to make the screens interesting, the loading screen is just black with a little spinning ring.  It gets very old to look at very quickly.
I truly like playing the game, when the audio doesn't skip and when I'm not looking at a black screen.  As I said, thank god I only spent $25 on it.  I cannot advocate buying it for any more than that.  It feels like a half-assed port, and you should only pay as much.  If I do go next-gen, I intend on buying this title again so that I can see how it was *meant* to be played.  As for now, if you are debating going for it on current gen but see yourself going next gen in the near future, hold off for now."
2024,3,"Story (8/10): Great story as it relates to Zack but contains gaps in the plot for the other characters, leaving the overall experience not quite connected.

Graphics (10/10): One of the best for the PSP.

Sound (10/10): Usually I zone out the sound on most games but not this one.  Voice acting and music were great.  Music contains hints of the original FFVII along with its own.

Control (4/10): Poor use of buttons.  There is one attack, one dodge, and one block button.  The block button is basically useless.  I used it for 2 battles against Summons and that is it, I used the dodge for the remaining 98% of the game.  Both Magic and physical attacks are mapped to the X button and you use the L&R shoulder buttons to switch through them which can be kind of a pain.  With 4 buttons, they should have used one for dodge, 2 for attacks (think GOW's small and heavy attacks), and one for magic.  The only positive is that the controls are responsive.

Gameplay (4/10): This is were the game really fails.  Crisis Core is a low level Hack n' Slash game especially considering the one button attack command.  All battles are basically the same no matter the monster and the ""side quests"" are dull and really don't give you anything of value.

Overall (7/10): While the production values are great, the gameplay is really lacking.  The story will carry you though the game at most once.  The only reason for replay would be to collect all the items."
2025,3,"Great game, fun to play just ignore the story. The lackluster voice acting an poor story keep me from scoring this game any higher. If you just wanna blow s*** up in a jet and have dog fights then by all means this game is a ream come true for you. If you're looking for story, then pass."
2026,3,"To begin, I'd like to point out that Bon Voyage, compared to its The Sims 1 predecessor ""Vacation"" is definitely a superior product in terms of not only its visual elements, but the depth of play and exploration value. However...compared to the rest of The Sims 2 expansion packs, BV ranks as one of the lowest, not only for the extreme technical incompatibilities that still haven't been resolved for a lot of users, but moreso for the fact it doesn't realllly add a lot to the game. Like University, BV feels like an unnecessary departure from the regular time span and flow of the game - since aging is suspended while away. Even the shortest length of vacation you can book (3 days, 2 nights) can feel dragged out.

Again though, there is certainly a lot more to do on vacation this go around. There are three distinct locales to visit (rather than Vacation's freaky alpine/beach/forest combo) - Twikki Island, a tropical paradise, Three Lakes, a mountain camping retreat, and Takemizu Village, a 'Far East' destination. Each locale has a number of hotels and villas to stay at from the low ranking bargain spots (try the free campground in Three Lakes!) to pricy luxury resorts that can cost your Sims upwards of $1,000 a night. Additionally, your wealthier sims can purchase a Vacation Home - be warned though, they're barely furnished! When you arrive at a hotel you get the opportunity to book as many rooms as you like - each room has a different set up and number of beds so your entire family can shack up in one room or take over the entire hotel. The only real unique thing about hotels is you can order room service - at a hefty price. Most hotels offer some sort of additional activity - fishing, musical instruments, hot springs or pools, massage tables, saunas etc. but in general the real action is outside of your hotel.

Each locale offers about 5-7 tourist spots for you to visit, which generally fall under one of the following categories: shopping lot, park, landmark site (see an ancient ruin or a giant temple), activity spot (each locale has a number of activities such as tea ceremonies, ax throwing, or learning a fire dance). This is essentially what should take up your vacation time - but instead of just visiting these places, you're given the challenge/opportunity to pursue ""Vacation Memories"", a special sub menu of unlockable memories tucked away in the memories panel. Everytime you do a certain action related to the hints on the Vacation Memories page - such as eat a certain local dish, find a hidden map, or participate in a regional activity - the memory is unlocked on your sim's path to being a seasoned traveller. I believe there is a certain reward for completing all tasks - but I haven't gotten there yet!

Aside from the added gameplay from the ""Vacation Memories"" challenges, there are a lot of neat little features that make the game superior to TS1's Vacation. For one, your sim doesn't just 'forget' their vacation when they return home. They can bring back souvenirs and unlock new interactions such as learning each region's local gesture, dances, and telling their fellow sims about their travels. You also earn vacation benefits for a short period of time after your return, ranging from extra success in the office to adding an extra 'want' slot. Additionally, if you discover each of the secret lots for the locales, you'll probably be coming home with an extra special ability, item, or even a creature.

In general BV surprised me - I was expecting a complete and total Vacation rip-off, and while it retained some of the key elements of Vacation, the Sims team really worked to make this game mean something beyond taking a break from reality (in a game that is truly a break from reality). Be warned - vacations don't come cheap, although if you played the Sims for this long, chances are you've figured out its pretty easy to earn buckets of cash for your Sims, and at least you've got somewhere to burn it now!

Bottom line - although I felt like the game added a lot to the original version of this expansion, I didn't feel like it added a ton to my enjoyment of the everyday game my sims are generally involved in. I'd say this is worth adding to your Sims lineup, but probably isn't a priority for most people."
2027,3,"TL;DR:  Amazing singleplayer, OK multiplayer, which is a disgrace for a Halo game.

It's been four years since the last events of Halo 3, when the Master Chief destroyed Delta Halo and was stranded on the other half of Forward Unto Dawn, drifting towards an unknown planet.  Halo 4 picks up right after Halo 3's Legendary Ending.

To start, the game looks amazing.  It is clearly the best-looking console game to have ever been released.  Cortana has never looked better in a Halo game, and the facial structures and emotions from the humans in the game are simply a work of art.  Sometimes, I couldn't even tell if it's just a game of if they used real actors during the cutscenes.  The story of the campaign is easy (enough) to follow, but I wish they would've gone over what happened between Halo 3 and Halo 4.  More on that later in the spoiler section.

The controls take a bit to get used to, since they tried to copy Call of Duty but with a slight Halo twist.  Banshee tricks are no longer mapped to the A button; you use LB to pull them off (WHY?!!!!), but other than that, if you didn't get so used to Halo: Reach's control scheme, you should be fine here.  Personally, I wish they would stop changing the controls so much and stick to what worked in Halo 2.  The gameplay itself, when it comes to the campaign, is your typical Halo experience we have all loved since 2001 when the original Halo launched with the original Xbox 360.  You're running through levels, shooting old and new enemies, uncovering the story, and reaching the end of a short campaign.  It took me five hours to be the campaign on Normal, but double that on Legendary.  I personally think the writing and the voice acting was well-done for everyone except Master Chief.  Some of his lines are unbelievable, and the painfully wrong tone is used sometimes.  However, it's still the campaign we expected from a Halo game.  But is the multiplayer the same we've loved since Halo 2?  No.  Unfortunately, no where near it.

To start off, Halo 4's multiplayer has gone through a bit of a change since it first came out.  They greatly reduced the auto-aim that was present when the game first came out (nothing wrong with that), and have added a few new modes.  They also recently added in SWAT and FFA Throwback.  FFA Throwback is basically what the original FFA mode in the game should've been, ripped straight from Halo 2.  FFA KoTH and Oddball are FINALLY available to play.  For some odd reason, though, they removed Team Snipers. But if you bought Halo 4 hoping to have as much fun online as you did in Halo 3 or Halo 2, you will be more disappointed than I am.  I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am with the multiplayer.

For one, they introduced a CoD-style loadout menu.  Now you can pick your primary, secondary, grenade, armor ability, and two perks from the Infinity menu.  First of all, when was the last time Halo had perks?  I didn't play Reach so I can't speak for that game, but as far as I'm concerned, NO Halo game has ever used perks, period.  Why are they in Halo 4?  If I wanted to play Call of Duty, I would've waited for Black Ops 2 instead of picking this up a day after release.  I don't mind being able to choose what weapon I want to use, I'm actually glad they FINALLY let me use the DMR over the Assault Rifle instead of having to hunt for it on the map, but perks?  On top of that, gone is the hectic fast-paced action from Halo 2 and 3.  For example, I like to use the armor ability Promethean Vision because it lets me see enemies through walls.  And I have yet to play a game where someone wasn't crouched behind a corner waiting for someone to pass them, or behind a box, or underneath the enemy base waiting for someone to walk down.  Camping has always been in Halo; those that loved the sniper know what I'm talking about.  But to see it in literally EVERY single Halo 4 game I play online is horrific.  Gone are the arena-style FPS days of Halo when you got destroyed because people had a better shot and reaction time than you.  Now, all you need to do is pick Cloak, find a corner, and sit and wait for someone to walk by so you can either shotgun them from behind or assassinate them.  Unfortunately, Team Slayer Pro, a game mode that eliminates the motion sensor, armor abilities, and perks, does nothing to fix this issue.  If anything, it's worse, because people are now more likely to hide in a corner knowing that no one but their teammates will know they're there.  Oh, remember seeing an X where your teammate died in Halo 2?  Those are gone in Halo 4.  So now you have no idea where your teammate died.  His clan tag just disappears and comes back when he respawns.

Another thing wrong with the multiplayer is the matchmaking.....I'm sorry, I meant the lack of matchmaking.  There is nothing that determines the players you're matched with.  For example, Halo 3 allowed you to choose between the quickest process or to only search for games with a good connection.  Those are completely gone from Halo 4.  I once played a game with a person from Guam.  Guam, for those that don't know, is a little island controlled by the United States that is located above Indonesia.  Can anyone explain to me how in the world someone that's thousands of miles away from the closest coastline of the United States managed to connect to someone living in the Midwest?  I stopped playing Uncharted online for the very same issue.  Too many times did I get paired with people that weren't even within my borders (Egypt, Portugal, Spain, UK, Brazil, etc).  There's nothing wrong with playing with foreigners themselves, it's just that the server I have to connect to in order to play with a foreigner is so far away, my ping is going to be ridiculously high, which means I'll experience a high amount of lag.  The only game I can think of that gave me little-to-no lag while playing with Europeans is Battlefield 3, which has dedicated servers.  Halo 4 does NOT have dedicated servers.  Another problem that comes with the lack of proper matchmaking is the mismatch of player levels.  It's never a good idea to pit a level 56, 65, 47, and 70 against a group filled with those still in the 10's and 20's, and I shouldn't have to tell you why.  Because of the absence of dedicated servers, there are times where the game will change hosts.  This is nothing new in a Halo game....except for the fact that someone may have killed you by the time your screen turns normal.  I've had that happen to me twice.

My biggest complaint with the multiplayer, besides it being too much like Call of Duty and not enough like Halo, is Spartan Ops.  Spartan Ops is the biggest P.O.S. I have ever played since Uncharted 3's multiplayer.  NOTHING is good about Spartan Ops.  The entire thing feels rushed.  The cutscenes are short and make me miss dramatic pauses I originally thought were over-done in a lot of games and movies.  The lack of dramatic pauses makes me feel like ""OK, what's going on h....oh...on to a new scene.  OK what's going o.......onto ANOTHER new scene"".  I don't have time to take in and digest what I just saw/heard two seconds ago.  On top of that, the cutscenes are literally crap.  This person talks, this person responds, this person goes somewhere else, says ""this is wrong"" (Really, Sherlock?!), some random end scene, end cutscene.  I can go to YouTube if I wanted to laugh at short videos all day.  To make matters worse, the actual gameplay is more boring and repetitive than Firefight from the previous Halo.  At least Firefight was challenging and time consuming (even though those types of modes I have never liked).  Spartan Ops is literally, ""kill these enemies, then kill some more, now move here, kill some more, hit some random switch, VEHICLES! :D, kill the last few enemies before the dropship arrives, end of episode"".  An entire episode of Spartan Ops (five per chapter) takes ten minutes at the most, and that's on Heroic while playing with a group of randoms.  You just sit there, kill kill kill, boring dialogue, vehicles, end game, and you're then sitting there wondering ""Why in God's name did I just waste 10 minutes of my life?""  The fact that these keep coming out every week only hurts Spartan Ops; that only adds to the repetitive feel of the mode.  The part that had me crying from laughing so hard is there are rumors (as of me writing this review and to my knowledge) that 343 Industries plan on charging for the second season of Spartan Ops.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!  That's a bigger rip-off than paying for cheat-codes, like Capcom has tried to do many times before.  Personally, Halo 4 would've been a better game if they stopped wasting resources on the abomination that is Spartan Ops and actually spent them improving the multiplayer.

**WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT!!**

As much as I liked Halo 4's campaign, like I said before, I wished they had explained more in the game.  For one, I had no bleeping clue who the Didact was until halfway through the game when the Librarian (again, don't know who she was, either, or why she was important) explained a bit of the history pre-Halo 1.  It would've been wonderful if the game was more friendly to newcomers/people who haven't been following the story/people who didn't read every book and watched every video made about the story.  I don't like having to search through hundreds of material to find out information on some of the events going on in Halo 4.  Granted the Librarian did do a fairly-good job catching me up, I STILL want to know, what happened to the Brutes?  They're just gone.  What happened to the truce between the Elites and UNSC?  Even Master Chief says this at the beginning of the game, ""I thought we had a truce with the Covenant"".  Now they're back at their old tactics, looking for random artifacts on some random planet for religious reasons, and making sure those filthy humans don't taint holy land.  Another thing I wish was more explained was what happened to the Arbiter after Halo 3.  A side-story on Halo: Waypoint explains he took the remaining Elites from the rebellion back to their home world.  OK, so why are they fighting alongside the rest of the Covenant?  They also barely talk about the Flood in Halo 4, and our favorite parasite is also absent from the game.  You blow up Delta Halo in Halo 3 and all of a sudden, no more Flood?  Maybe an explanation for some of my questions were explained in side-material, but again, I would've appreciated it if Halo 4 explained some loose ends, even briefly.

Another problem I had with the campaign, besides it being short and a bit ridiculous on Legendary (headshots should kill shieldless enemies, period), why does Master Chief have such bad voice acting?  When Cortana informs him that she's not going back to Infinity with him, he stumbles with his words, then changes his tone completely when he says ""We go together"".  He went from complete disbelief to sounding like he was barking an order to a Marine.  It's so painfully obvious that it doesn't match, that ONE bit of the campaign is something I'll remember for a while.  I'm actually a bit neutral towards them showing his face for the Legendary ending.  His eyes were blacked out, but you got a pretty good idea of his facial features.  Nothing too major, of course.

** END OF SPOILERS!!!**

Overall, I miss Bungie.  I do like the campaign 343 created, and the graphics are amazing, but considering the multiplayer is only OK at best, it's a huge disgrace to the Halo franchise.  Halo's multiplayer has never been ""OK"".  Let's not forget it was the console king until Call of Duty 4 was released.  Unfortunately, 343's methods of handling the issues is quite poor, and makes me miss the way Bungie interacted with its fans."
2028,3,"I like the way that reviewers rate the gameplay as well as the overall purchase on this site. It is good to know what you are getting for your dollar.  I can see why some would be upset when they bought this game.  Games are already expensive.  I was suprised that you had to pay an extra 20 bucks to unlock more characters.  It is no different with the ""special edition.""  I got the game used for $25  and paid the extra $20 for the unlockable characters because I wanted to use Lei Wulong right away.  I loved Street Fighter when I first played it on Super Nintendo and loved Tekken when I first played it on PS1.  I knew I would give this game a shot regardless.  I like this game.  The controls took some getting used to for me because I am use to playing fight games on a Playstation controller.  This is my first fighting game on a 360.  The tag and gem system works well once you figure out how you can mix and match the combos.  I am having fun with the online play even though I am getting hammered!  I was 1W & 5L and had to go back to training, LoL.  I am really enjoying dream match ups that I never thought would be possible between the Street Fighter & Tekken series!"
2029,3,"I'm a casual gamer and always like a game where the primary objective isn't shooting things. Here it's all about, well, isn't it obvious?

Unfortunately, the graphics aren't really a ton better than what you get with a PS3, but some light effects and reflections are indeed very nice looking. The game is very much like Assassins Creed, as it's all about stealth and climbing up roofs and avoiding all-out battle.

The setting is a dark, wet, 19th century London type setting, and although I'm sure the story line and cut scenes make the setting perfectly clear, I found myself rather too bored with the voice acting and dialogue to really get into it.

I'm looking forward to playing it more as I only started, but am worried that it's going to be a fairly generic journey of: get past these guards, steal this stuff, and upgrade your gear as reward, before you do it all again in a slightly different setting."
2030,3,"I bought it because it was on sale, but now I'm not sure that even that was worth it. Although the PS4 technically features voice commands, I've yet to find myself in a situation where it was more convenient than just reaching for the controller. Additionally, there don't seem to be any games that take advantage of the camera. If you stream on twitch and want to feature a live feed of your face in the corner, then I suppose this is a good deal (and maybe your only option?).

Another note, my boyfriend is really paranoid about having a camera facing into our living room all the time, so he unplugged it after about 2 weeks of use and it hasn't been plugged back in since. If you have anyone in your home who feels the same way, that may be something to consider."
2031,3,"Okay Let me put this out there first: I did love the story; Even when you die and the Law Enforcement guy went no that didn't happen *Game Restarts at Checkpoint*! The whole Anti-Hero justice thing is hard to pull off in any case and they nailed it. Near the beginning I was driving and I passed white sup. territory and I got called multiple racist names. At first I said what the hell I got to get to my objective but I found myself breaking hopping out of my car and beating them all up. It gave me some feelings of Metal Gear just for a moment (That's for a later time).

After that little fun repetition and feeling of watch dogs, sleeping dogs, GTV 5, Saints Row, and all the open world mentality really got to me.

I mean there were random things to do other then kill white supremacists (example, there are way more gangs on every corner) and you can put good time into it... It's just not re-playable.

I am also one of those reviewers who disliked instant travel. Let me explain, I would be okay with it if the surroundings had more going on... how about the skyline and working on the buildings. I understand all IP's are on a budget but I wish they put more into the city itself and gave it more character... like the cut-scenes had."
2032,3,"other then the fact that the seller didn't included a plug for it witch is needed if you own the original xbox 360 model

i enjoyed the connect but there wasn't really any good games on it except for dance central"
2033,3,"If you like singing, this is probably the best product you can get on the PS3--it has the real songs and videos, the scoring system is relatively good, and it's fun.  As a party game it's great too--but held back by the song selection.

While the game is great, the Singstore is far from impressive, especially when it comes to North American artists.  Sony has been lethargic with regard to adding songs from the back catalog (there are a number of more popular songs in the PS3 discs), and the selection is much smaller than that of other regions like the UK.

What makes this more frustrating is that Sony, already a few years in the PS3's life, is still making PS2 discs with new content, while the PS3 version stays stagnant, which is where it suffers as a party game--since a great of the songs are unknown (like Natalia, who has 5 songs)--a lot of people don't know the words, which makes the game less fun, especially with things like pass the mic.  To make the game work at a party you need artists and songs that are more ubiquitous like Madonna or Michael Jackson, which you can get on the PS2 discs.

If the PS2 discs didn't have more popular songs I'd give this game 5 stars, but the best Sony will do is a disc-swap, where you're stuck with songs you won't want, which is the opposite of the a-la-carte selection we are getting used to.  Sony said they would update the store every two weeks, and, aside from the poor update selection (in the US), they often miss updates.  If I didn't already own the game, I wouldn't bother buying it, as the Singstore is horrid, which is unfortunate because for the songs I do like, it's a great game.

The other issue people seem to have is the wireless mic problem; while it would be nice I don't really play enough for this to be that big a deal."
2034,3,"- Story 3/5: Step back compared to the original Dragon Age, but about same quality as the Awakening expansion. The game feels very much like an expansion pack, rather than a true or full sequel (it is called Dragon Age 2, after all...). If the first game was as epic as the Lord of the Rings story, this would be as epic as watching Frodo tap dance. Too much time is spent on mundane tasks or fetch quests. Some of these quests reminded me of Assassin's Creed games, because of their simplicity and execution. The game polish is also missing. In many places, DA2 feels like Risen: lots of potential, but too many opportunities missed.

- Graphics 5/5: Great improvement over the original.

- Characters 2/5: None of the new characters is as developed as Leliana, Morrigan or even Alistair. You also don't get to interact with them enough. Most of the time, in order to talk to them, you have to visit them all over the city. Sometimes they have something to say and most of the time they don't. Spreading them and the merchants all over the city is just another poor idea. It works in terms of how the story is set up, but it's another chore.

- Maps and inventory 2/5: If you liked the Mass Effect 2 system, this is very similar. The maps have become big mazes that are difficult to follow. Loot is useless and most of it goes straight to junk (but fills your inventory). Most of the items can only be used by you. Again, don't understand what the developer's logic was.

- Fighting 2/5: Gone are all the strategic fights that made DA1 so much fun. In DA2, most of the time the enemies spawn from thin air, so it's impossible to plan a fight (except in dungeons - see below). Even when you do, more enemies keep showing up. You can still issue commands to your team, but playing on highest difficulty is impossible.

- Level Design 1/5: This is the biggest problem of this game. The levels are not only similar, in the case of most dungeons they are identical to the last stone! You may have a 5-10 room dungeon that  - regardless how it's called or where it is - it looks identical to others you have visited many times. You already know where the enemies will respawn - it's just different enemies. Now - I can understand reusing some textures - everybody does it - but this is a level of laziness that I've never seen in any other game.

This doesn't stop here though. Because the story takes place over 10 years in the same city, you'll keep replaying this over and over. You can now understand better the spin EA's marketing team put on how the story is 'organized'. I can't imagine replaying this game again.

I have to give credit to EA and Bioware for knowing how to play their cards. A special edition has been provided to the gamers that preordered before end of December. This pretty much meant most of the DA1 fans. The reason - the gamers that didn't play the first game, will buy this and enjoy it as is. The people that preordered, will get the free characters, maybe bicker a bit and get over it. Professional Reviewers will give this a high rating regardless, since that's the tradition in the industry. Smart play that saved them a ton of development money, for a great profit.

One other thing to be aware of: if you received your preordering codes, you probably noticed you have to create a Bioware account to get access to you items. Make sure this matches the same EA account you have on XBox, because no codes will be provided. I made the mistake of creating a new account (not realizing I had one on the 360), so I ended up not getting any of these items.

In the end  -this is subjective - some of you will like the game, others will hate it. One thing is sure - this is not a true sequel and it's nowhere as good as the original. EA went for a quick buck, same way they do every year with all their sport games. It's disappointing, but a lesson learned. EA will no longer see me buy their games on first day.

That being said - this is not a one star game. As long as you know what you buy, it's up to you to decide when or if to buy it and how much is this worth to you."
2035,3,we got this for a  wii and are not happy with the gel it sticks to your feet and it sticks to socks as well. hard to clean.
2036,3,It's good for a simcity game but was looking forward to so much more when this came out. Was really anticipating something special but ea again let's me down
2037,3,"This game is OK, it's not as good as Super Mario 64 or B&K but its a nice game for the ps1. Gex 3 is a humorous platforming game kind of like conkers bad fur day but not as funny, and no you will not be seeing singing poop. This movie has a decent amount of content with your collectables and such, there are a nice array of different levels parodying television channels like army channels, pirate movies or anime channels. The controls are nice but the camera flops sometimes. The graphics are acceptable but the beauty is taken away from the fog, its like mine craft on low render distance, yeah. Anyway its no classic in my book but it is nostalgic as I played this at a young age. I say spend your money on Crash Bandicoot or Spyro first if you are buying ps1 games to play. Its ironic that the people who made tomb raider, made a platforming game that really didn't do so well."
2038,3,"I'm a strong puzzle solver, amateur puzzle author, and I solved every puzzle in Puzzler World without hints.  I review from this perspective.

On the plus side, Puzzler World is polished and addictive.  The puzzles are fast and light, and you get a nice reward flourish when you solve one, so you want to just keep going and solve more and more of them.  The game was definitely fun enough to keep playing and was a great way to kill small blocks of time.  Also, there were some puzzle types that I found particularly enjoyable -- my favorites were Link-A-Pix and Codeword.  Overall, I found Puzzler World fun enough that I wanted to solve every puzzle.

However, on the minus side, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, for many reasons.  About half of the puzzles were designed for children and could be solved in less than one minute.  In fact, an expert puzzle solver could solve many puzzles in less than 15 seconds.  Example #1:  there are many ""puzzles"" that involve filling in a diagram where some spaces have dots in them.  This is mildly fun with pencil and paper, but with the DS, you just poke the dots with your stylus and the spaces fill in automatically, so there's zero challenge and zero fun from drawing.  There are also way too many word searches, hangmans, simple jigsaws, simple math problems, and other trivial, boring puzzles.  (Though I have to admit, I do enjoy the simple anagrams.)  But besides the many trivial puzzles, there were also too many sudokus.  I don't like sudokus, I find them repetitive and a ""grind"".  Fortunately, you don't have to play any puzzle type you don't like -- I chose to solve them anyway so I could beat the entire game.  Sudokus were a fraction of the puzzles in the game, but I'd guess that I spent most of my time playing sudoku, just so I could beat all the puzzles.  (In fairness, there is a way to get past the grind parts of any puzzle, by using ""hint coins"" that you gain from solving other puzzles.  I just chose not to use any hint coins.)  Lastly, I wasn't impressed with the crosswords.  I dislike pseudo crosswords where clues are only available in one dimension for some squares, as it means you are more likely to get blocked on a single word you don't know.  Again, I could have used the hint coints, but chose not to.  In the end, there were only two puzzle types representing about 10% of the puzzles that I found very fun and compelling.  In Codeword, you have to decode a solved crossword where all the letters are replaced by numbers.  In Link-A-Pix, you have to draw a color picture based on logic.

Bottom line:  expert puzzle solvers will not find these puzzles challenging, but, you are not required to play any puzzle type you don't like, and it's still a good way to kill small blocks of free time."
2039,3,"This is a hard review IMO.
The gamepad is fine, but it  DOES have some connection and receiving issues.

Every now and then it stops working for a brief moment.
I even have the usb dongle connected on the FRONT of my CUP in order to ease the connectivity and it still fails sometimes."
2040,3,"The mouse as a mouse -
The SCIMITAR - when plugged in as a simple generic Windows mouse works just fine. The high DPI allows for a lot of sensitivity tweaking, and when used on my MIONIX ALIOTH mousepad, it tracks with zero issues.  The ergonomics are a bit weird for me - my primary mouse is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mionix-Castor/dp/B00XJZ59Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mionix Castor</a>&nbsp;- a palm grip style mouse, and arguably one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used. The SCIMITAR's profile sits a bit higher up, similar to a claw grip. It really feels like you need to get your pinky on the edge to move this thing around smoothly. I've got a pretty 'medium-sized' hand - 3.5"" across the palm - so if you've got giant hands, this may fit you better. Folks with smaller hands may find maneuvering this thing more difficult.

For the macrokeys, they're a pretty standard MMO-style mouse set up. The columns run in a textured / not-textured / textured / not-textured sort of pattern so you can hopefully tell by feel which button you want. The buttons don't feel super heavy-duty and you do have to be pretty precise to hit the correct key. However the actuation is also on the stiffer side, so that helps cut down on the likelihood of accidental pushes when moving the mouse around.

The mouse with drivers -
I've had very bipolar experiences with Corsair's custom mouse software, and it's really no change here. The CUE software - although better with firmware and software updates - is very temperamental. I don't want to have to 'reboot' my mouse to get my macrokeys to work. I don't want to have to worry about my RGB settings linking up with other peripherals all the time. I don't want to worry what will happen in the middle of a game if the mouse software crashes. Unfortunately if you want full use of your macrokey cluster and fancy RGB light set up, you've got to install the CUE software. I'd highly suggest taking a look at the Corsair forums about CUE software (specifically with Windows 10) to get an idea of what might occur. It might work flawlessly for you, but it's one of those situations where if you get a build of the CUE software that's stable, you end up wanting to keep it and never update it for fear of what might be broken in the next build.

Conclusion -
If you need a giant macro-mouse, the SCIMITAR isn't bad. If you find a version of CUE that works for you, this is a great little mouse. Unfortunately, it seems like a roll of the dice on whether or not you'll run into issues."
2041,3,"It's just okay. Great for a portable mouse for laptops/lan events.
it's portability is its downfall though... The thing is very small and uncomfortable for every day use.
I would suggest getting a more ergonomic mouse before buying something like this."
2042,3,"Interesting game: however I love more of hidden objects when there's a lot to look for at one time. For those of you who like a story line and enjoy going back and forth to solve situations though, this is the perfect game."
2043,3,"Since this was the first pure Rpg I had ever played, there were alot of things I found really neat about Final Fantasy 7. I liked most of the secondary characters and found their plot development well executed.

That being said, this game has one of the worst protagonists ever. Cloud. The reason he doesn't take the top honor of this? Because there are far worse protagonists, one of them being Squall. I guess emo kid Protagonists just don't do it for me.

It also relies very heavily on plot, that came before it (in that it shamelessly rips off 6 and previous Final Fantasies to the point of hilarity) in order to stand on it's own merits. Most Final Fantasy 7 rabid fans, probably couldn't actually play this game, due to the fact it's frankly no longer pretty enough for them. These are the same people that will try, in vain no less to convince you that X is a great Rpg. (and boy is that one TERRIBLE at the end.. don't get me started on the sphere grid, love story... anyway back to 7)

If Final Fantasy 1-6 had never existed and 7 was original I'd have a much higher opinion of this game, but between the rip off nature and Cloud it really kind of drags the game down for me. I never quite got the hype, yes there are a few characters that still stand out as pretty neat, Vincent and Cait Sith, Red XIII, Aeris, Tifa and Cid. But almost everything else is miserable. Even the Iconic of Bad Guy Sepiroth Yeah I've seen better since him. Far better.

I wouldn't recommend this game really, there are much better things you can do with your money, such as Xenogears, Final Fantasy 1,2,4, and 6. Final Fantasy Tactics, IX, or even XII."
2044,3,Nothing new or interesting has been added to Madden in the last few years. It's a Madden game. It was basically another Roster update.
2045,3,"Unlike many reviewers I have seen, I actually managed to install this game and play it.  So, instead of simply reviewing the crash process of starting the game, I get to actually review the game itself.

The game takes place in a near-futuristic London.  Essentially, demons have invaded London (not sure if they got all of the earth actually) and the cities population has retreated to the subways.  Not entirely sure why but it seems that demons fear subways and have left them alone for 20 years.

I prefer to lay these reviews out in a Pro/Con format, so allow me to start with the pro's.

Pro:

Some interesting classes to choose from.  With your melee, shooter, and caster classes having two professions each, you will likely find something you like.  Skill tree systems (almost exactly like WoW) give you a limited chance to customize your character and different types of weaponry is available depending on your class.

The melee classes work in a third person view for some good hacking and slashing fun while the shooters and casters enjoy the use of a first person shooter system of dodging, aiming and rather old school shooter gameplay.  The views are adjustable if you feel the need to play a different viewstyle, so don't think that you would be pigeonholed from the start.

Con:

Sorry that the pro's were so short, but that was really about it.
The failing point of this game is that it is simply pure grind.  Now I understand that there are people who like grind in their MMORPG's, but in a single-player game, plotless grinding is about as much fun as.. well.. work.  Multiplayer may spruce this up a bit, but then again the day I buy a game for the purpose of multiplayer is the day I jam my arm into my mouth and start chewing mindlessly.

I also got a bit annoyed with the ""talent trees"" for the classes.  Due to the huge lack of passive skills and the large slew of pointless skills, you can count on investing points into three or four things the entire game.  Couple this with the lack of decent hotkeys for your right mouse button (like Diablo 2 had) you really are only able to make use of 3 talents at a time.  It seems that if Hellgate was so intent on ripping off WoW and Diablo 2 they should have simply gone all of the way and snagged the good parts too.

Balance issues were a bit annoying.  I first started out as a Blademaster but soon found it to be a meaningless class.  I love the idea of putting a weapon in each hand and rushing into combat, but when 95% of the baddies die in one swing, the second weapon is a bit pointless.  Essentially, I was able to do lots of damage, but noting lived long enough to make it worthwhile.  Since blademasters lack in any sort of defense, I got killed constantly.  Rather sad when compared with my Marksman or Evoker characters who never died the entire game.

The user interface can go and dump itself off a bridge for as much as I love it.  Due to a terrible inventory system, you can count on opening it and playing a bit of Tetris every three minutes or so.  There is no autosort function and it seems that every rat you find is carrying a bazooka for some reason.  The minimap does little but show you where you are in respect to the wall next to you, even when zoomed out completely.  The main map shows you only that you are in a specific area, not where you are in it.  So, enjoy wandering around in circles in a vain attempt to find your exit.

I noticed the random level generation plug in the game description somewhere, but I actually saw very little of it.  I played through the first act about three times with different classes and vividly recall going through the exact same level designs.  Items, monsters, quest objects and chests would be in different spots but the level layout looked the same each time.

Which brings me to the last con, the look of the game itself.  To the people who have already played the game I ask ""What was your favorite level, the smashed up city street, the sewer/subway tunnel, the red colored hell level or the red colored smashed up city street level.  That was all that I saw in the game.  It gets so repetitive that you constantly find yourself backtracking (thank you worthless minimap) and getting nowhere in the badly textured, unimaginative wasteland that is London (or will be, sorry anyone who lives in London).

To recap, Hellgate London is a grindtastic shootfest which exploits bits and pieces from World of Warcraft and any run of the mill shooter to make a dreary dull game.  You will do the same quests over and over again, in what looks like the same exact settings.  Gameplay issues will challenge you further than the creators ever actually intended as you attempt to uncover anything resembling a plot in this mess.

In all, amusing for the first few hours, but almost a chore for any longer than that."
2046,3,"This game is a bit of a disapointment. Sure, you can make your own game, but it'll have to be by the limitations given to you on the disc.

Characters and Monsters-

First of all, I was quite surprised when I found out you can't make your own characters or monsters! Imean, you figure, if you can make your own game, then that'd be a given! But, nope. You have to use a set of pre-made models as your characters, most of which are based off of Fantasy creatures and archetypes, so that pretty much stops you from making a NON-Fantasy genre RPG.

One cool thing, at least, is that your character's picture is drawn in six, different art styles, so you can choose how you want his or her portrait to look, so that's at least something. You can go for an Anime portrait, or more of a traditonal painting type picture, for example.

The character models are a decent number, at close to 50 male and 50 female different character models, but you can't really choose the colors of your models, too much. Basically, there's Color Styles One and Two, which are normal. Three usually changes the ethnicity of your character model, and Four is usually an alien or demon colored palatte.

Text -

I actually bought a Logitech Keyboard controller for this game, only to find out that it doesn't work for this game, which pretty much sucks, as typing is SUCH A CHORE! If you aren't prepared to spend literally hours typing text with your Playstation controller, then DON'T buy this game! I actually wouldn't mind the manual typing that much, but the thing that really irks me is that there are numerous unused buttons on your controller (mainly, the shoulder buttons, select, and start) in the typing screen that easily could've been assigned to do things, such as the Space Bar, Shift, Caps Lock, Numbers, etc. But, no. Instead, you have to do ALL of this by moving your control stick over to the buttons on the display keyboard in the game. No shortcut buttons for Shift, Space, etc.

Come on! Most games that require you to type ANY kind of text at least let you use make a space inbetween words by hitting R1! Needless to say, the typing is very, VERY tedious. I'm patient enough to spend hours typing things by control stick and X alone, but I'm guessing most people won't be.

Assigning Point Values -

Another annoying thing is how they claim how EASY they make it to make your own game, but it's really not. Doing such things, as assigning attribute points to your characters can get you very lost in numbers quickly, if you don't keep track of things. There is no automatic regulation system that makes sure you aren't making your characters too strong or too weak for whichever part of the game you're at, so you have to keep all of this in check, yourself. It is quite easy to make a character too weak or too strong, or not have them level up with enough points, or not have them fairly balanced between each other, or anything else. You can easily get lost in numbers in assigning points and attributes, and there's nothing in the game to help you keep things balanced, so you'll have to be dilligent in balancing out everything, yourself. Unless you're fairly good at math, this won't be easy to do.

Movesets -

A very ANNOYING thing is how virtually everything else in the game has it's own master list, except Moves. For each Class of warrior, you have to make your own moves and assign them power points, effects, and animations. This takes usually about a minute or two to do for each move once you've mastered the process of doing it. The animations for the moves you do are fairly weak, but at least there's enough of them to make moves actually look different from each other. The frustrating thing is that once you've made an entire moveset for one class, the game WON'T let you re-use these moves! You'll spend about half an hour to 45 minutes making a class' moveset, but since the game doesn't have any kind of master list for the moves you've made, you will not be able to re-use them for other characters, without remaking them form scratch.

In other words, every move you make is exclusive only to the warrior class that you made them in. You can't re-use moves you've previously made. This means you'll be spending hours making move after move for your classes of warriors. It'd be a lot simpler if you could just access them from a list and re-use them for other classes, but no. This actually made me want to stop making classes of warriors after eight of them, because after making 128 moves total for every one of my classes, I got sick of making them and didn't want to recreate any new classes after that. The fact that you can't re-use previously made moves is a very annoying thing, that shouldn't have even been an issue here, being you can re-use ANYTHING you've made in the Field Editor section of RPG Maker 3.

Terrain and Town Editing -

Speaking of Field Editing, could making terrain BE any harder, here? I don't think I'll ever learn how to make smooth, unbumpy terrain in the Altitiude editor. Just making your own field is simple enough, but making it Smoothly, is another thing, entirely.

Making towns are simple enough, even if a bit limiting. Basically, you choose what kind of town you're going to make, in which most of differ only by the walls that surround them. Then, after filling in the type of sky, season, time of day, etc., that you want your town to have, you go to the Layout editor and start dropping buildings in them. It's a little annoying that you can't really test out what your town will look like from your character's point of view as you're making it, being that the Layout is a very dizzy-inducing overhead view shot. But it's a small complaint. Out of everything in this game-maker game, the town editor perhaps is the easiest thing to use and the closest thing you'll have to actually making something exactly as you see it. The town space you'll have is a bit small, but enough to actually make a fairly decent RPG village.

Another thing. Why isn't there an option to edit a World Map? It'd be a lot easier to just make an entire country or continent, and just fill the spaces in with towns. But, no. Instead, you have to make fields and towns like ""levels,"" one at a time, and warp to them when playing. That's pretty lame that there's no real Overworld, you can make.

Music -

The songs in this game are fairly decent and standard fair for an RPG title, but also a bit generic. While none of the songs are really bad or anything, my suggestion if you decide to buy this game, would be to preview all of the songs first and then decide which one you won't mind hearing for hours on end while editing your game, because you'll have to stick with hearing that song on an endless loop, for HOURS!

You could be more resourceful and grab your iPod or turn on the radio while editing, but even THAT gets repetitive. There's only so many songs you can stand listening to while spending a very long time editing a video game. I decided to use a non-song, such as the Wind blowing, to avoid having the same track play on an endless loop, driving me insane!

Most of the music is your standard RPG style piano and harpsichord tunes, so the music isn't too bad. Just not that great, either.

Story Aspect -

The storyline editor is more annoying than fun, like you'd probably expect it to be. This all comes from the massive amount of manual controller typing you'll have to be doing. The story elements are only as limited by your imagination, and how long you can manually type before getting arthritis.

Overall -

Overall, I thought making my own game would've been fun. I am certainly patient enough to spend numerous months finely crafting my own game to perfection, if I needed to. But this game-maker title only makes it seem like more of a chore than anything else. I'm sure real game makers actually have more fun making real games than anyone possibly could with this title. I'm a bit dissapointed, overall.

I'd have to say, if they were to expand this series, then:

1) They should come up with other genres. If not other game-making genres, then at least an RPG Maker that's not limited to only Fantasy creatures and settings.

2) They REALLY need to improve the typing, here. You know how your phone can automatically remember words you've texted before in Text Messaging? Well, they need that, here. They should allow you to stockpile a list of Frequently Used Words, or something. And they need to make use of ALL of the buttons on a controller if you're going to spend hours typing things on a standard PS2 controller. Not letting you hit R1 just to make a space or L1 to shift is pretty lazy.

3) They NEED a Character Creator editor, because just using the standard models given pretty much sucks.

4) Field Editing needs to be much easier. Sort of like a ""Sim City"" style.

5) They need a walkthrough mode, or a help screen, or something. Sort of like that cartoon Paper Clip in Microsoft Word. Especially when it comes to editing terrain and fields.

6) They need to make Moveset editing and Point Assigning a lot easier. Come up with a system, or something. I don't mind losing creative control when it comes to making points and values.

When it comes right down to it, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't serious about becoming a video game creator. Because other than people who want to spend their living making RPG games, I can't see anyone else really enjoying the process of making your own RPG title. I'd like to consider myself very creative and highly motivated, but even I found this game to be tedious and tiresome in their layout of making your own game.

It isn't the time it takes making a video game from scratch that gets me. It's how frustrating and ultimately boring it is, making it.

*** Stars."
2047,3,Okay
2048,3,"I really LOVED Grandia 2. I can't say enough good about that game and it's perhaps one of the best RPG's I've ever played. When I first got it I played  NONSTOP till I beat it. But this one, was just not as memorable.

I'll just go over stuff as it comes to mind.

The music. I honestly didn't like the direction they chose for music in this game. It was fruity and kidsy, while the music in 2 (I treasure the bonus cd that came with 2!) was really unique, cool, and rock centered. Basically, it sounded like something from a Final Fantasy game and I wanted something that set the sound of the two apart.

Combat. Well, it was sorta fun, but it just felt like it was lacking somewhere. It was quite engaging to pull off the combos, but somehow not as fun to try to do cancels. I got to that point where I was just blowing through battles without caring about strategy or combos and that my friends, is a BAD place to be at.

Special Moves. I sort of preferred the upgrade system from Grandia 2 where you bought what seemed the coolest to you with points. It just wasn't that fun constantly doing special moves until someone would say ""that's it!"" I'd rather be able to see what I'm working towards with all these battles.

Mana Eggs. I didn't like the way they did upgrading of them either. I'd like to see progress if I constantly do magic, but I didn't get that feeling from combining mana eggs. All I saw was those orange level bars on the screen, but it didn't seem like it made a big difference. It wasn't fun going through all the trouble of getting new spells from the eggs as well. I just felt bored out of mind while I was waiting for the eggs to combine and break to form spells even if it did take only 5 seconds.

Story. UGH, the story. They borrowed from the Final Fantasy book again.  The story was just so aggravating to watch and I rolled my eyes hundreds of times throughout it. I couldn't even try to care about this wacksauce story if I wanted. When game stories keep throwing this ""love is stronger than.."" or ""my heart is between us.."" mess in I instantly get bored with it. When I got to the end, I was just like, ""okay, back to playing Battlefield."" When I beat 2 I was like, ""wooooooooow that was great"" and I just didn't want it to end.

Oh yea, in many instances the characters are just to overly serious. Like for example, let's say Alfina tripped on a rock. The whole party would be like, ""AHHHHHHHHHHH ALFINA!!!! ARE YOU OKAY?!!!!!!"" Yea, it ain't that serious now.

But yea, overall I thought this game was just decent. It wasn't horrible, but at the same time, I'm mad I went so crazy trying to find it locally."
2049,3,Would work great if DS cards weren't spring loaded (a design flaw on Nintendo's side in my opinion and the reason I hate to buy physical cards anymore
2050,3,Ok got madden 15 on ps3 which i don't play anymore since i got xbox 1 but 1 thing i don't understand why is it everytime i run ball with tony romo i fumble  ball so got run out bounds which i hate because stops clock when am trying kill clock end game so is xbox 1 version better or is it same then ps3 version i just want know before i buy it
2051,3,"The fact that this game is a collectible, but it's not backward compatible.  It will not work on your XBOX 360 system even if you purchase an original XBOX internal hard drive, it doesn't work.  My friend will just let me borrow his first gen XBOX so i can play this great game."
2052,3,Game was ok but I was saddened that it didn't bring anything new as far as gameplay. More like an expensive dlc expansion. Speaking of dlc costumes are over priced and majority of sounds from previous game AND they are waaaay over priced!
2053,3,No clue as to how to use it!!
2054,3,"I don't have a lot to add to what the other reviews here have to say.  Overall, it's a decent keyboard and has some nice features for gamers.  However there are two issues that I'd like to mention.  The first is the software.  The software that the keyboard ships with installs a driver for Sideshow.  This driver can cause a pretty serious error on some 64bit Vista machines that will prevent the computer from starting up.  Logitech has an updated version of the software on its website that removes the driver and works fine with Vista, but it took quite a few hours of frustration on my part to figure out 1st that's what was causing the problem and 2nd how to fix it.

The second issue that I think needs to be mentioned is that it seems like this is not a full sized keyboard.  The keys are ever so slightly narrower than a standard keyboard (or at least the one I use at work) in order to keep the overall footprint of the keyboard fairly small.  What this means is that it can take a bit of time to get used to typing on it, and I found myself frequently hitting the caps lock key when I reached for ""A""."
2055,3,"I would love to give this a 5 star review, but I can't. I've been playing video games for about 26 years now, never really got into the whole mouse and keyboard thing, strictly console. But I'm aware, as far as FPS go, that the mouse and keyboard combo is superior, especially in terms of accuracy and control, so I decided to try this out. I did a lot of research, and apparently this is the best mouse for gaming out there. It should be noted that I'm using this for PS4, via a XIM4 adapter. Mostly, it works perfectly. But there's one huge problem: the click wheel. It works when moving vertically 100% of the time, but when I try to move it horizontally, it only works sometimes, which is frustrating. Right now I'm trying to get adapted to the mouse/keyboard combo, so I'm only practicing on one game for now: Rainbow Six Siege. I set my wheel click right to change the fire mode, and the wheel click left to ping, and being able to change fire mode in the heat of the moment is critical. I thought I may have received a faulty mouse, but I received a replacement, and same problem. The problem was there before and after I updated the firmware. I also updated the firmware on my XIM4, then reset it to factory settings, nothing worked. I don't know if this is a problem overall, or a problem because I'm not playing on a PC, but nonetheless, it's a problem that shouldn't exist."
2056,3,"GAMEPLAY 6.5:
  Here's how it goes down. You choose the animal(s) you want to create. You choose the walls and make the pen. You put the animal(s) in the pen. Your read the zookeeper's instructions on what the animal(s) want(s) (such as water, trees, and rocks) then you do it. It may sound boring (especially how I put it), and it is, but you can still suck some fun out of it. The annimals can be rather boring (but the same goes for real life).  The main thing you really need to do is make the zoo look pretty. This is more of a landscaping sim than a zoo building sim.
GRAPHICS 4.5:
  The graphics are rather simple but they aren't terrible. Nothing great here.
SOUND 4.5:
  The animals make the same sounds over and over whenever you click em'. It gets annoying fast. The best part of the sound is probably the opening song (which isn't that great).
REPLAY VALUE 4:
  After you finish making a zoo with every animal you probably won't touch this game again for a while."
2057,3,"This game is great the first time when you play it was amazing, but the second time was boring. Also it is kind of short"
2058,3,"Do you like games that are creative?  This game is the most creative puzzler to come along in years.  And it looks extremely cool to go with it.  Now the problem.  It's stinkin hard.  Do you really want a creative game where you can't get past the first 10 levels?  That is surely going to happen to you.  It is a shame as this game could have been a kick tail game.

Bottom Line:  Is it fun?  For the first 7 levels.  Will I keep it?  No way.  Unless you like to replay the first 10 levels over and over again.  Is it for kids?  Too hard."
2059,3,world of zoo took us a little while to figure out. it isn't as much fun as some of the others. it's confusing and could def be better
2060,3,"We all know most of these things but this review is just to cover basics and give you an idea of what you are in for when you rent/purchase this game.
Graphics: 2/5
Simply they are not up to PS3/360 standards, however they are not horrible.

Gameplay: 3/5
The game gets very repetitive you are breaking down in you vehicle at the same 2-3 spots all the time or looking for supplies in the same 2 places through the entire game.

Story: 1.5/5
The story.... well it almost does not exist. There starts being a hint of one developing in the first 10 mins of the game and then it is gone. It is re-mentioned once here and there but not often enough.

Action: 5/5
The action brings this game back, lots of zombies to kill and some good ""scares"" in the game as well :).

OVER ALL RATING: 3/5
Meaning buy it in a month or so when it is less then 50 dollars ;)."
2061,3,"Not a really bad game but nothing great ethier love re4 alot and was hoping for more lots of bugs,poor AI, just not alot of fun or replay here."
2062,3,"single player boring.
online is fun but not as good as COD.  harder to master, takes a long time to get in top 3.  limited games, CT Flag and gold.  buy for only only."
2063,3,"(REVISED REVIEW 1/18/08 - Bump overall rating to 4 stars)

If you have never played any of the Gothic series, this may be a good place to start.  Gothic 1-2 were simply excellent games.  I would, in fact, consider them to be all-time classics, almost on the level of Baldur's Gate 2 and Fallout (but in a very different style).  Gothic 3, unfortunately, was a bit of a misstep, buggy even once patched and jettisoning almost all semblance of plot - and the plot was one of the strongest points in Gothic 1-2!  See the Gothic 3 reviews for more details (stunlock, lol)

Apparently this packed DOES include the Night of the Raven expansion for Gothic II - the item description does not make that at all clear, and does not mention it at all.  So I've updated this review accordingly."
2064,3,first thing i noticed was the graphics were good in HD but then i noticed that there is no customization for the cars whatsoever. that's one of the best parts of racing games is to buy the upgraded parts so your car goes faster or handles better. this game doesnt have that.
2065,3,I liked the game. It has a great story line and the live action part is a great addition. The gameplay is pretty cool but there`s unfortunately not enough of it. There's really not that much game in this franchise. I feel like I paid for a $60 movie where you can choose how it plays out and that`s why I knocked some stars off. It is a very short and repetitive game but with great b movie storyline. I would recommend renting it or just wait for it to sell for less than $30.
2066,3,ONE FLAW! I HAVE BIG HANDS AND THE PALM REST DOES NOT RAISE! The idiots at Razer made it so you could extend the Orb Weaver for longer hands but forgot to put a mechanism in the palm rest to raise it to compensate for the stretching of the Orb Weaver...  I have to fold a thick wash cloth and put it on top of the palm rest to get the height I need. Not made for people with big hands. Horrible design.
2067,3,"Sonic Rivals pits Sonic the Hedgehog against some of his buddies that appeared late in the series. Knuckles, Silver, Black etc.  I think about the time Sonic started having buddies was when the franchise became less fun.  You rocket around 3d tracks with no time to react to what you encounter which means if you play online, someone will have cold memorized the track and will kick you silly. If you play in story mode, its very little fun unless you have the reflexes of a chipmunk on crack.

Gone are the days of using your intellect and mastery of the controls to get through the map.  Now, you hang on and I guess if its summertime and you are 10, you play over and over to learn the map thoroughly.  The best thing about the original Sonic on Genesis was the imagination inventing puzzles and bosses.  Now, the levels are stunningly pretty, and you go fast, and the bosses suck and the control is not trustworthy.  I won't play anything where I can't control the character because the system is too busy doing something else, which begs the question : It's 2d, why is it so hard to

make a game that plays as well as the Genesis (I guess the PSP is 100X faster)?

Pick it up if you want to play with friends.  The story mode is useless."
2068,3,"PS3 console is way too expensive for something that's almost 10 yrs old....this super slim is very noisy with discs (the vibration feels like a time bomb ready to blow, that's why I try to use digital content only) it also has lots more issues with freezing but otherwise does what it needs to do."
2069,3,good choice for little kids
2070,3,"It works fine, the game itself is like a sweat maker haha, it's good for having fun but if it is meant to be some sort of work out replacement, I don't think it's very great, but as a game is fun and entertaining."
2071,3,"I have been waiting for a 1st-person shooter Civil War game since North & South for the NES came out...who knows why it took so long?  Who knows why they made this so poorly?  And historically accurate? I think not.  The game itself is not THAT bad.  I do enjoy playing it, but expected SOOOO much more.  I want a game like Star Wars Battlefront but with Civil War soldiers and bigger battlefields.  This is like a very short version of Call of Duty with worse graphics.  VERY linear, I think that is its fatal flaw...I hope somebody reads these things and makes a better Civil War game instead of another WWII game.  I was looking forward to Shiloh, but they turned it into a stealth mission instead of the wooded bloodbath that it was...I was looking forward to Burnside's bridge at Antietam, but it's only a footnote in a disappointing level.  I was looking forward to Fredericksburg (either defending the wall or fighting my way up the heights), but alas none of that was there.  WHY?  I didn't pay much for it so $ isn't the issue...it's just a mediocre game.

The only pluses....I found the computer AI to be decent...The atmosphere is good with the ambient sounds and things (unfortunately this is all but killed by the linear gameplay and disappointing level design), and lastly, the HOPE that someone takes this game and improves it to the level of Call of Duty and other 1st person shooters.. PLEASE!  Unless you are a Civil War buff like me or need a 1st person shooter other than WWII, you probably won't like this game (and if you are a Civil War buff, like me, you're sure to be disappointed...)"
2072,3,"Is not a big deal, but is fun if you play with friends."
2073,3,good
2074,3,"I bought my xbox when they first came out, and a couple of years later, a new xbox, and many problems i write this review. First off xbox is a huge, heavier lugger. I was very surprised to see that it was the size of an 80's VCR when the new consoles were small and light weight. Still i got it and payed a hefty amount for it, and thats when the ripoffs began. The jokes began when microsoft released the S-controllers not long after the xbox release in an obvious ploy to get more money as people relize that the giant controllers that they came with were useless compared to the new smaller ones. The xbox however stayed a working machine and payed itself off as i enjoyed its great games more and more, until it started to break

The first xbox models off the line had many problems with them and mine was one of them, the disk drive wouldnt recognize games half the time. I found that it would usually recognize my old games, but never rented ones or new ones(ones i had just payed 50 bucks for and now couldn't play). Slowely the rate that it would recognize the games dropped and eventually would scratch the discs so they wouldnt play on a working xbox. I put up with this for a couple of months, because i didn't want to pay for a new xbox or the repairs since it still sometimes worked.

Then one day the xbox menu wouldnt show up, and it replayed the start up diagram over and over again, the hard drive was fryed. Xbox wanted 80 bucks to look at it, they weren't even sure what the problem was or if it could be fixed. So i said fine and left it alone.

Eventually Halo 2 came out and the price of xbox dropped so i bought another one, only to have it now showing the same problematic signs the 1st one did.

It is fun for a while and then the problems and money rip offs get to you like paying for the DVD unit, S-controllers, and now the new xbox is almost out."
2075,3,"I thought this would be as good as the other Animal Crossing games but sadly it is not.  You cannot use your personal Mii like you can in the other versions.  Also, you cannot take your uniform off but only add different pants, skirts, shoes or hats from a very limited inventory.  You cannot shop in any of the stores you design or buy anything yourself since you never earn any money. You do not have a home of your own so at the end of each play day, you do not ever go home, the game just saves and asks you to continue or quit.  It becomes quite repetitive since all you can do is design other animals houses but cannot use anything yourself.  Would not buy again."
2076,3,"The good news is, Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters is a very faithful entry in the Ratchet & Clank Series.  The creators didn't try to do anything too outlandish, tamper with the game to 'be different', or strip away any of the PS2 release in order to fit it into the PSP (this may be due to some claims I've read that the PS2 version was a port of this PSP version).

That said, there are severe limitations to this title that all seem to center around having to use a PSP to play it.  I love my PSP, don't get me wrong:  but this platformer is not easy to wrangle on it.  I seem to be constantly suffering from camera problems:  slow panning when I call for it, and quick snapping away from the scene when I'm just moving around means that a lot of times I end up having to run away dodging so I can put distance between myself and my opponents and buy some time to get them back in my sights.  There is a ""strafing mechanic"", but heaven help you if you start off at the wrong angle.  There is a ""snap the camera to center"" mechanic, but fumbling for it during combat is awkward.

There is also some difficulty with button-mapping.  Jumping, high-jumping with mechanical assistance, and long-jumping use the same button mappings.  Trying to time the act of running, tapping the shoulder buttons, and simultaneously hitting the 'X' button can be really difficult--and performing the wrong type of jump can be either frustrating or fatal.

For those reasons, I don't recommend that someone new to Ratchet and Clank start here.  Try some of the newer entries in the series to get used to the gameplay, then get ready to have to make some accommodations to do on the PSP what you're used to doing on the PlayStation.

If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.  He is a whiz with gadgets and mechanics, and from day one of the series he quickly fell into the role of 'Hero', a celebrity status that he seems to enjoy.  His sidekick is a clever little robot named Clank.  Clank not only helps him figure things out, he serves as some of Ratchet's gadgets, transforming into jetpacks, one-man helicopters, and more.  Clank also gets some play-time of his own, too:  there are times when you get to navigate him around a smaller-scale world, often enlisting the help of his fellow robots.  They live in a sci-fi world where there are plenty of planets to explore and all kinds of interesting life forms, most of whom want to kill you (but a few would settle for a good 3-lap race or two).  Dialogue varies from funny to downright hilarious, and there is enough variety in your objectives to keep things from getting boring.

The beauty of the Ratchet & Clank series is that it marries both sides of platform heaven:  Ratchet gives you the jumping-action-shooting, while Clank lets you play strategy-maze-puzzle styled areas.  As a whole the series is quite fun, and each installment seems to come up with more gadgets and fun things to do than the entire run of Warner Brothers' Roadrunner/Coyote cartoons.

That said, if you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank and you know your way around, you will be pleased to see that the graphics haven't been compromised.  Colors are rich and bright and sounds ring out crystal clear.  You'll probably get used to the way things work on the PSP, but be prepared for some frustrating reloads in order to get where you're going."
2077,3,"The ""spirit-eater"" aspect to this game makes it ridiculously, rigidly difficult to do anything, get anywhere, without backing yourself into a dire situation you can't escape from, much less function in. Fortunately, online I found a cheat code to turn it off, and then the game became enjoyable. Either I'm a total RPG wimp, or else this game is for a more hardcore type of player."
2078,3,"I bought this chatpad because i had one for my Xbox 360. I will say this one does have some flaws...

Its ridgid, not rounded like its previous version, which you can feel with your fingers. (which irritates my hands)

Also, since the controller is somewhat different from the Xbox 360, the chatpad sits in a differerent position then some of you may be used to or like, which will throw your game off for awhile until you get used to it.

To me, this unit also feels a bit heavier then the 360 version, but that might just be because i haven't used one in awhile.

Overall, the function works perfectly, its nice to have 2 programmable buttons to take me to where i need to go immediately. (like anything that requires me to go through more than 1 screen)"
2079,3,"The water nearly looks like the ocean in real life, and the storms are truly a force of nature - both beautiful and deadly. Difficult to pick up, repetitive, and less than rewarding after a few hours play. Especially if you run into a group who are only interested in griefing players who actually want to work the content. It is a beautifully crafted work missing any sustainable reward system, demo level content, lifeless mechanics, tailor-made for griefers. It is in 30 years of gaming the most money I have paid for the least amount of content."
2080,3,"overall, this game is pretty good. but everything good about it was already made. anyone who has played hulk: ultimate destruction can tell ya this game is basically that one reskinned. everything was great about hulk is still great about prototype but almost everything they've added is not that great or flat out bad.

Alex mercer the main character is wholely unlikable. not only is he dressed like a tool but he acts like one. they play the damaged victim card from the start of the game, wronged in some unnamed way by a large corporation he must protect his sister and find out who he is. but the sheer numbers on civilian casualties and collateral damage make it hard to feel for the guy. he's a super powered whiney punk so you can't really get into his shoes.

there's a ton and a half of collectibles landmark collectibles, hint collectibles(hints that if you've ever played a game before you already know), web of interest nodes and tons of upgrades for your character. it seems like activision could've spent more time actually working on the game and the story and less time on the little useless bs."
2081,3,"I must preface this by stating that my review of this product is based on very limited usage...  Why even review it then?  To let others know you likely won't even need it.

I have had my Wii now for 2 months and have used the Nunchuk exactly twice (and that was only on the included Wii Sports game).  I have since played mainly Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Wii and Zelda and guess what?  The nunchuk is not needed to play them and in my opinion it actually hinders the game play when you try to play with it.  I was sucked into the marketing behind the Wii and bought an extra controller with motion plus and an extra nunchuk at the time of purchase, hind-sight 20/20 I really didn't need the nunhuck or motion plus as the regular controller will be what I will likely ONLY use.

This review is in no way a reflection of the quality or performance of the Wii ""Nunchuk"" but should serve to let you know it would be wise to make sure you actually use the included Nunchuk before purchasing an additional one."
2082,3,"MK vs DC has unfortunately not stood the test of time & I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a serious online competive fighter. Initially when it was released I loved it, eventhough a lot of people complained about it for various reasons, but now there are just far too many glitches that went un-fixed. The online is, in a word, broken. This game should really only be reserved for the single player modes or side by side VS with friends, (friends that don't know any of the glitches!) The cons aside, it's a fun MK title with DC characters & in my opinion, includeded the best Sub-Zeros of it's time. But with all that being said there isn't much of a reason to pick up this game, especially since MK9 is out & in full swing with it's overall improved gameplay. I'm only keeping MK vs DC as a party game & because it's got Batman in it. And you can't get rid of Batman."
2083,3,This game was somewhat disappointing. The Teen rating gave us no fatalities and limited amounts of the traditional MK blood & gore. The story modes were OK but nothing special. No extra modes. Just Arcade and Story. In Story you can pick to be the MK fighters or the DC superheroes. But the fighting engine isn't that great. If you want a great PS3 fighting game pick up MK Complete Edition.
2084,3,"Truthfully, I really want to be able to recommend this game.  It's not as though there's not a lot here to recommend--the story is well written, and though it doesn't stray TOO far from the well-beaten RPG path, it does break some new ground.  The battle system, while not revolutionary, is at least workable.  More than anything, I got around forty hours of solid enjoyment out of this title.
The only problem is that it took me sixty hours to finish the game, and it's those other twenty that get in the way of my giving an unconditional recommendation.  There are a lot of ways to screw up a game.  You can poorly design the levels, you can write a broken combat progression, you can blow the ending--the list is pretty well endless.  One way that I never thought I'd witness, however, is simply not finishing the thing.  This game is not done.  There is no other way to put it.
All the way up through the end of the first CD, things cruised along nicely.  Then, all of a sudden, the world map disappeared.  That's the only way I can think to put it.  Whereas before I had been able to control where my characters went and explore the environments, now I was forced to sit through rather uninteresting sequences featuring one of the lead characters sitting in a wicker chair and telling me what I supposedly just did.  The ONLY interaction between the game and the player through that second CD consists of fighting the boss battles that it unceremoniously thrusts you into.
That is a terrible, criminal sin of game design.  You are allowed to put the plot on a rail if you want, but you DO NOT get to take away any ability the player may have had to control the game or interact with the world.  At that point, your ""game"" ceases to be a game and becomes an experiment in button pushing.  I don't mind exposition, but I do expect to have some control over my own fate when the speech gets done.  If you take that away from me, I get angry, and this game made me VERY angry.
There are other problems here as well.  By Square standards, the localization is dismal.  While it's not as incomprehensible as, say, Okage, there are still some pretty serious mistakes in the English script.  Is it just me, or is it reasonable to expect that the people localizing my game for me know that the word is ""should've""--not ""should of.""  Mistakes like that are strewn throughout the game text, and I must admit that it detracted a little bit from my ability to enjoy the experience.  Of course, as the game progressed, those errors got worse.  Around halfway through the second CD, the script writers were dropping words by the twos and threes.  Now, that didn't throw me SO much, since I normally read like that anyway, but for people who, you know, like to have all the words, this could be a problem, particularly coming from Square--a house made famous in part by its great localization efforts.
The plot is a little bit more adult than you're likely to find with other games in the genre.  Indeed--any parents out there who might be concerned with their children reading thinly veiled discussions of pedophile priests and cartoon buttocks would be well advised to avoid this title.  It's really pretty standard anime/manga fare on the whole, but, strangely enough, you don't see much of that in the video game industry, so the game manages to be unique and interesting.  Of course, the religious references could use some work.  I know from Dogma that Metatron is the recording angel (and that's pretty obscure), but I find it difficult to believe that somebody who hasn't been through seminary is going to be able to appreciate all of the parallels that this plot has with the Christian faith.
On the whole, this game is ALMOST incredible.  Had it stayed in production for another year, it might have made it all the way there.  Unfortunately, the product that we're left with is unfinished, with some incredibly serious problems near the end (for example, what is the point of letting me run around all over the world map and collect all these great pieces of character gear if the last dungeon is a GEAR dungeon?).  As it stands, RPG faithful and anybody willing to overlook the game's faults should find an interesting experience, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's not a member of one of those niche groups.  We can only hope that Xenosaga (NOT a prequel, as most would have you believe), due out early next year in the U.S., avoids the mistakes that hold this title back."
2085,3,Too easy to get killed and if only you could save the game at any point.  Save points are too far apart for me and I have to repeat the same scene way to many times.
2086,3,"My review of Homefront the Revolution for the PS4

Pro

Interesting story - While the story in Homefront the Revolution can come off as being cheesy I really didn't have an issue with it (I like how they show the 2 North Koreans working in a garage which look very similar to the way the late Steve Jobs & Steve Wozniak did). I like these alternate history story from 2003 Freedom Fighter (in which the Russians won the Cold War) to 2014 Wolfenstein The New Order & Amazon Instant Video The Man in the High Castle (in which the Nazi won World War 2 which for me as a Jewish person is very scary indeed) to the 90s sitcoms Sliders.

Long Campaign - From someone who enjoys games with a strong single contents (there is a four player co-op mode) this to me is a plus. The campaign is about (from what Ive heard) 20 hours long but it can be longer if you are willing to take on the side missions like random events, finding radios & weapons stash and side jobs like kill 5 seekers with a shotgun or take out a certain number of KPA soldiers with a molotov cocktail.

FarCry Approach - For those who like the way Ubisoft approaches open world games then youll probably like Homefront the Revolution. Basically you hack some kind os server (very easy to do) and once is done other areas in the map will open up such as bases and other side things to do. Bottom line is if you like that kind of approach in an open world game then youll probably like Homefront the Revolution.

Guerrilla Tactics - I like how Homefront the Revolution encourage you not to go in gun ho (you can but you will get easily kill). instead you have to take a cautious approach like instead trying to go in the front door of a n enemy base you could
A. see if there is a ramp and if there is one you can hop on a motorcycle and ride the ramp into the enemy base or
B. find a backdoor and unlock it and try to take a stealthy approach to it and try to take down the enemy quietly.

Modifying Your Weapons on the Fly - And finally another neat feature I like that they put into Homefront the Revolution is the ability to add & switch attachment to your weapons. For example if you want to add (or detach) a scope to your shotgun or assault rifle all you have to do is push the up button on your PS4 control to bring up what attachment are available, hold the R1 button and move the left analog stick to which scope you want to use and it will be added on to your weapon right away (you don't have to go to your base to add or remove modification to your weapon). Also you do have the ability to craft certain weapons like molotov cocktail or home made bombs (youll need the material to make them since they are scattered all across the game).

Cons

Too similar to FarCry - Although I enjoyed the gameplay in Homefront the Revolution it really doesnt do anythings that hasn't been in other games like the Assassin Creed or FarCry series or even the Watch Dogs game. It doesnt mean its a bad game it just doesnt do any thing new that all.

Lack of Polish - Probably the biggest issue facing Homefront the Revolution. While the game is certainly playable you can definitely see the lack of polish in this game. First off youll need to download the day one patch because the game without it is almost unplayable and while the the patch does fix a lot of the problems there are still some issue such as getting stuck in one place (this happen to me once and I had to restart the game at my last save), ok visuals (a little bit better then The Divisions but that not saying much), a below 30fps ( probably around 25fps), a somewhat long loading screen and finally Ive notices that every time I exit a shop the game pauses for about 5 to 10 second.

Overall - I have mix feeling about Homefront the Revolution. While I definitely like the approach they made to this game. Its lack of polish is what hold it back and I think that a damn shame thought (not to mention the development hell it went through). While I don't think the game is as bad as some reviewers have said its far from a perfect game and that a shame because I do want this game to do well but I have a feeling there a good chance this game will more then likely flop."
2087,3,It's a loud.
2088,3,"[...]BR>This is definetly not the best FPS out there. But it is still a really good game. The action is really heart pumping. THe guns are really cool. Vehicles rock and kick [...] But sometimes the framerate is really slow. Graphics are excellent.
  This game is just abit boring. 30 minutes of playing is about it. It gets so boring. There is not much . After all, believe it or not, Gamecube is the world wide best seller gaming console.
  If u have a gamecube, buy Metroid Prime."
2089,3,"I have been captivated by Zelda since I first played Ocarina of Time on the N64. In my opinion, and in many opinions from what you can read online, OoT is THE quintessential Zelda game. And I believe that people have been seeking the feeling we got from OoT ever since. But Nintendo has failed to deliver that over and over, and while TP and SS were GREAT games, they just were not the same . . . leading fans to be desperate enough to give this game a five star rating. Especially when you consider how long we've been waiting for the game after so many delays. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game, and I'm glad I picked it up. It's just not a 5 star Zelda game. I'll tell you why below, but beware, there may be minor ***SPOILERS***

Nintendo clearly spent huge time and effort creating the ultimate Zelda sandbox. The world is vast, the interactivity is better than ever before, there are infinitely more items to collect, people to meet, weapons and outfits to acquire . . . it's great! But it's an incredibly superficial game that doesn't take much thought to progress through.

Pros:
- A vast Zelda world.
- An items and inventory menu on par with typical massive adventure games. MUCH MUCH MUCH better than any Zelda game ever. Pages and pages.
- Great graphics and immersive audio/soundtrack.

Cons:
- The voice acting (which at first I was excited about) was HORRID. So bad I wished they just continued with their tradition of leaving the voices to the imagination of the player.
- The character development is corny to say the least, and often times bordering on infantile. The characters just do NOT convey the desperation you should be feeling with Calamity Ganon very clearly alive and ready to consume everything. Even the main characters which should be hardened warriors are just . . . I don't even know what to call them.
- The translation of the game from its original language is very awkward and leaves you wondering what you just read sometimes. You get the message but it's just very poorly done.

- THIS IS THE BIG ONE: There is a huge lack of substance when it comes to gameplay. The only reason to put hours into this game is because it's so huge, and has nothing to do with an actual challenge. Traditional dungeons have been replaced with ""shrines,"" which take about 2-3 minutes max to beat, and sometimes they take no time to beat if the shrine was at all challenging to get to. You just walk in and collect what you collect. There is a lack of specialty items that are required to advance (for example, a hook shot).  I'm sorry, I don't care how many miles Link has to walk, and how many creatures he can see if at the end of the day there aren't deep, dark, challenging puzzles and dungeons to play through. That's the meat of a Zelda game!

Overall, I am happy with the purchase, and would purchase it again. I have to say though, this is a FAR cry from ""the next Ocarina of Time"" or the best Zelda game there is. It is clear to me that Nintendo spent more time building the land and the items you collect than they did in creating challenging puzzles and dungeons. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, there are going to be a few big gaping holes that leave you wanting something else.

TL;DR, Nintendo created something fun to look at, but it's painfully obvious, and often so, that they replaced quality Zelda with quantity Zelda."
2090,3,Just buy a metal gear game. That what this wishes it was
2091,3,you must have plenty of xbox memory to save this game but the quality is great and the tutorial is understandable.
2092,3,"I'm a fairly big batman fan. No, I was no overly impressed with this game.

It is competently put together. Production values are high. There are AAA voice actors and good motion capture. The story is decently well-done. No major bugs and the combat systems work like they should.

Why didn't I like the game?

It's hard to put a finger on it, but let's start with the physiques of the characters here. They are all bulging. You see batman's like sub-muscles ripping through his suit. Even Joker looks like he's been taking steroids, and Joker is supposed to be a wimpy joke, you know? The thugs and the guards all look like they're on Barry Bond's steroid plan. It's like a protein milkshake with creatine and HGH added as supplements.

This matters to me because it just doesn't feel right with the batman franchise. I'm used to the cartoons, of course, but Batman is supposed to be like an olympian level athlete and one thing about him is that he's efficient and to the point. Polishing the little sub muscle between like your chest and your ribs, whatever that is called, is pointless, and doesn't fit with the character. In none of the cartoons I grew up on is Batman ever bulging. He's actually of slightly better than average physique. It's like how real life soldiers don't have muscle mag physiques because muscle mag physiques are heavy, impractical, and limit flexibility.

Yes, that bothered me. Even the women are 'roided and have weird hip to shoulder ratios.

The game has some light stealth elements and the levels allow you a certain amount of creativity in getting things done. Still, it didn't feel all that challenging. Not when batman always has a get out of trouble quick ability by his grapple hook. Yes, the grapple is part of the lore, but you can always hit it and find someplace to zip away to. You always have a get out of jail card, so there is less danger overall, and with less danger is less tension. He also performs the grapple perfectly every time. This takes control away and makes it less interesting.

and the bosses. There are boss fights. It's typically batman vs some 'roided villains. The last battle is against a 'roided bad guy (can you guess who?). Actually, lots of video games do this, for example, the acclaimed Bioshock. But it still doesn't mean that it's a good thing to do. Since it basically amounts to batman finding some way to stun the enemy and then punch the guy before the guy unstuns and throws stuff at batman. Then batman dodges and finds an opportunity to stun the dude again and bash him before he unstuns.

But THIS ISN'T HOW BATMAN OPERATES. Batman doesn't do drawn-out boss fights. Batman is a ninja/detective. Ninjas avoid confrontation. They find clever ways around obstacles. THey don't take them head-on.

And bats can take on multiple guys at a time in a big gay testosterone bash, and with the last guy he always does some sadomasochistic male stripper talk-to-the-glove move that leaves the guy clutching his behind and writhing in ecstasy/agony (pain is pleasure).

FYI, Harley Quinn is mo-capped by a short Asian guy and has doubtlessly been fantasized about by countless gamer nerds who have no idea that they're drooling over a short Asian guy.

This game is basically a standard 3d action-platformer with a 'roided gay batman theme. It's competently done which is why it gets 3 stars, but oddly, doesn't feel inspired."
2093,3,"I was glad to see that Midway released a compilation of their arcade hits to the Xbox 360, but was disappointed to find that they were missing some very good games. This collection has all of the main classics you'd expect like Defender, Joust, Spy Hunter, Sinistar, & so forth which are good games, no doubt. However, what was lacking were the major arcade titles that would have made this collection even better.

First, I'll list the titles that come with this release. Those titles are:
1.  720
2.  APB
3.  Arch Rivals
4.  Bubbles
5.  Championship Sprint
6.  Defender
7.  Defender II
8.  Gauntlet
9.  Gauntlet II
10. Joust
11. Joust 2
12. Marble Madness
13. Pit-Fighter
14. Rampage
15. Rampart
16. Robotron: 2084
17. Root Beer Tapper
18. Satan's Hollow
19. Sinistar
20. Smash TV
21. Spy Hunter
22. Spy Hunter II
23. Super Off Road
24. Super Sprint
25. Toobin'
26. Total Carnage
27. Tournament Cyberball 2072
28. Vindicators Part II
29. Wizard of Wor
30. Xenophobe
31. Xybots

Truthfully, that's not a bad line up of games, but why stop there? Midway could have easily added more titles to this collection. I personally would have included Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2, Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Hydro Thunder, Primal Rage, Narc, Roadblasters, Klax, Vindicators (don't know why they put part 2 without part 1), Badlands, Paperboy, Hard Drivin', Race Drivin', & Super Off Road: Track Pack. While it would have been outdated, I would have loved to have seen them include NBA Jam & NBA Jam: Tournament Edition.

I like the way they have the arcade borders set up when you're playing the game to give it an arcade feel, but at the same time, they should have included an option to allow you to stretch the picture to fit your screen. For example: If you try playing Spy Hunter on a wide screen TV, the actual game screen looks so small. The borders take up most of the screen.

This isn't a bad collection, but I just think that Midway could have done a better job releasing a classic game compilation. Adding the major titles from the early 90's & the ones they left out would have made this an awesome compilation. The screen adjustment is the other downside, but beyond that its still not a bad collection. If you're a fan of the older arcade games & especially the Midway releases, this collection isn't bad for the money you pay, but don't expect anything new. If you still own an Xbox or PS2 & you own Midway Arcade Treasures Volumes 1 - 3, then you have a bigger collection of games than you do with this compilation. I give it a 3 out of 5 star rating."
2094,3,"After trying out controllers, mainly xbox one, DS4, Steam Controller, I would have to go with the xbox one controller because of its out of box windows support, and because the ds4 is made for baby hands. Yea DS4 is a cool name but is it better than xbox controllers, no."
2095,3,"Flash Focus DS

The premise of Flash Focus is that it is a daily vision training tool for your eyes. The exercises are intended to gauge and improve 5 abilities that range from movement tracking, hand eye coordination, to peripheral vision. There are fundamental exercises that train you, and there are sports activities designed to both train and entertain you. For the first 2-3 weeks, I felt Flash Focus was kind of fun. I didn't really feel an improvement, although it said I was steadily improving. After awhile, it got very boring especially once I unlocked all of the activities. Most of the exercises do not really test your vision skills but instead evaluate your brain. The number flash, letter count, and a lot of the other exercises test your ability to memorize and regurgitate the numbers you saw. In advanced mode, the game flashes a long number for a split second and demands you to input the exact number. If you transpose 2 digits or miss one, it is considered wrong. I've gone to several optometrists and ophthalmologists in the past and they never had such testing going on. Overall, it is a fun novelty game that may or may not improve your vision with regular use. The novelty wore off quickly in my experience.

Pros: Easy way to track, manage, and improve your vision based on the game's parameters. Nifty sound effects, and some of the sports activities are entertaining.

Cons: Dated graphics, most of the exercises test your photographic memory capabilities rather than your vision. I never understood the peripheral vision test on a Nintendo DS. The real eye doctors use a much different test for peripheral vision

Overall: 3/5 stars"
2096,3,They worked.
2097,3,"I bought the used one and i regret it because once you get top the second disc it stops working my PLAYSTATION stops reading it
so if you get it you can take your chances at buying the used one but if you don't want to take the chance get the new one
but that could just be my PLAYSTATION

it's an ok buy"
2098,3,"Game play is very predictable, my son was bored with it after a week and has gone  back to older versions."
2099,3,"For those of you who played Grandia 2, you know how addicting that battle system is.  Fortunately, Grandia 3 brings it back, and with better graphics it is all the more impressive.  I only wish the rest of the game was equally impressive.

  In my mind a good rpg needs 3 things.  A good battle system, a decent to outstanding plot, and at least a few sidequests.  Grandia 3 may have one of the worst plots in any rpg I have played.  I felt very little connection to the story and characters in this game.

  Also, this game is very linear.  Very few if any sidequests to divert you from the horrific main storyline.  Overall, the game is very short.  You can easily win it in under 25 hours.

  I will give praise for the graphics in this game, they are beautiful and push the ps2 to the limit.  The music is fair, but nothing great.

  Grandia 2 featured a great story and characters along with the battle system.  About the only upgrade in Grandia 3 is the graphics.  However, I don't play rpg's to admire great graphics.

  Its worth checking this game out because of the battle system.  Its just a shame because this game could have been so much better."
2100,3,Just needed to have it for my collection don't really play it. But it is a good game & it's a Madden Trendsetter.
2101,3,"The quality of this game is questionable... however, its definitely something that should be experienced. The second half of this game is much better than the first. Give it a try."
2102,3,"I enjoyed this game with the following caveat: It's too short. The game play is well done and fun. It offers some interesting variations on the Quake/first-person shooter genre. The story line is a little trite, however. The ""Ring"" element seems forced and contrived. For a spooky ""Ring"" like game, check out the Fatal Frame  series."
2103,3,"So I bought this game just to have around since we have a lot of guests at our house often who are into music. I am not a huge karaoke fan/expert but I think the design of this game is quite good. The battle mode is a lot of fun and adds a bit of depth to singing which you don't get in most bar karaoke scenes.

the option to record and share videos is probably the most used feature of the game so far for my house. This is sad for two reasons. One you can get a free app off the PSN that lets you browse the store and watch other peoples' videos (no need to buy the game for this). Two the videos are about 30 second clips of the whole song, which is a blessing for some performances but there are a lot we'd like to see the entirety of.

The big bummer of this game is that it is a UK release which has limited support in the way of songs available. UK has about 1200 songs available, while US has about 900 songs (and my friends and I couldn't identify half of the musicians). UK gets an update of 10-15 songs every two weeks or so, US is lucky to get 4. You get the idea. On top of that, the songs that are available are often strange choices. Obvious bands like Talking Heads, Devo, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga and more are missing. Even stranger they will have the rights to songs from a good artist that you wouldn't think of as good ""sing along"" choices, when on the very same album much better choices are excluded.

I don't want to say the game is bad. I have had some fun playing it with friends. But if you are thinking about it browse the online store to see what your song choices are beyond the disc(s) you are considering. Singing the same 30 songs gets old, especially if you only like 10 of them. I'd love to give the game a higher rating, but no matter how well designed the game is a poor song selection will cripple it.

Other note: the two microphones that come with the game are of higher quality than I thought they would be. They also feel quite sturdy in hand."
2104,3,Those damn endless waves of enemies sure know how to tick you off in the campaign...
2105,3,"This is the most annoying hidden object game (HOG) I've ever played, bar none. The stuff is hidden devilishly well, which is fine, but the hint system gives such weak and short-lived flashes that I've been known to go through 3 hints before even seeing what they were talking about! Earning more hints isn't fun either because it involves a large, Minesweeper-type game--one hint per win. This, too, would be fine, except there's NO partial credit. Several times I've made it to the last few boxes then had the mouse go nuts and blow the whole thing with a right click instead of a left one. SO...no hints for me. :(

On the plus side, the pictures are pretty, and the added battlefield facts are quite nice. I just wish the hint system would loosen up some. The game is suitable for the hearing impaired because everything's captioned/subtitled, but I wouldn't recommend it for much vision loss."
2106,3,"It's a nice game but it seemed to aged badly, hard to enjoy this game now a days when there is better fighting games with a lot more characters to play as. Would only recommend for classic games players."
2107,3,"This game has a sandbox approach to it that I really like. The ability to create your own world is awesome, but very time consuming. The bad part is grinding out hours of gameplay to purchase the items to customize your world. It has a RPG style gameplay mashed with Minecraft. But I would give higher rating if you could play as other characters without purchasing additional items, since as it stands you have to buy more toys to unlock in-game items and characters. This is, of course, not likely to change, since it's a money mill for Disney.

The sound and graphics are both excellent, which is to be expected. And the action is fun.

If you want a good stand-alone game, you probably might want to move on, but if you want a fun game that has a great deal of expansion opportunities, this is an excellent choice."
2108,3,"This game, in the tradition of Myst and Riven, has appealing environments, reasonably challenging puzzles and a solid storyline, and is ultimately fun to play.  Unlike Myst and Riven, Crystal Key offers a 3-D environment to  navigate via Quicktime movies rather than clicking through two-dimensional  snapshots.  There are some disappointments, however.  Graphics quality is  uneven, and while I avoided serious difficulties the software does seem to  contain some bugs. The soundtrack has some pleasing snippets of music, but  clearly the producers didn't bother putting together much of a musical  score.  The interface, while easy to use, reveals some solutions through  its highlighting of ""hot spots"" on the screen.  The end of the  game lacks the payoff sequence you'd hope to see after spending all those  hours working through the puzzles and saving the world.  Ultimately, one  has some sense that this is basically an unfinished product, but at the  price offered, its not a bad value."
2109,3,"While I liked the idea of seeing all the different Disney characters I realized something while playing this game. I am not a huge Disney fan. I like Jack Skellington but he is really a Tim Burton character not Disney, they just hold the pink slip. The gameplay was smooth and the story was interesting but not interesting enough for me to pick up another game and start playing it.  Sad to say KH went to the  'to be finished soon' game  pile in my cabinet."
2110,3,"I forgot to review this game long time ago when I bought it the story was ok, Resing evil really is falling down as an story now they need to go back to its roots"
2111,3,"I bought this on sale at Wal-Mart for $25. The sound is good, the LEDS are cool for the price, but they can get uncomfortable."
2112,3,"I really, really want to like Uncharted 4.  I'm a long time fan of the series.  When I first played 1 - 3, and on any replay, I couldn't stop, couldn't put it down.  I have started and quit Uncharted 4 three times since May.  I write this now not knowing if I'll ever finish it.  I played for over a week in May; made it about 6 or 7 hours in.  I picked it back up in July; started over but quit again after a few hours.  At the beginning of September, I was in the mood to check out the amazing graphics again.  I just picked up with my July save.  This last time I made it over 10 hours into the game, which is halfway; maybe a bit more than halfway.  It's dull; it's too 'been there, done that'.  I can't recall ever feeling so blas&eacute; about a game.  I normally have an obsessive need to finish games.  Ah, well, I'll pick it up again in November after the HDR update.  I'm sure that will be stunning.  I love my HDR tv.

It makes me sad because the graphics and acting have never been better.  The combat is better than 3 but 2 still has the best mix of combat to story nugget.  In fact, the graphics are the best on the PS4.  The best I've ever seen as I don't own a gaming PC.

Also, I bought the first tier collector edition.  The metal case looks really cool.  I display in front of my other games."
2113,3,"I'm not a huge football fan, so this game wasn't that great for me. It's a bit complicated as well, but that would be a plus for an avid footballer. If you aren't into football too much, not worth the money, but if you are into football even a small amount, a good buy!"
2114,3,"Crackdown in a phrase is a flash in a pan. The open world city is a great touch, the orbs are challenging, and the story is okay, but thats about it. You play as 'the agent' and you can go anywhere, do anything, and take out the three gangs in any order you choose. However once its done, its done. Sure you can continue to play but as for the story, you play it once, then you have to probably delete your file and start all over because there is no New game option. Normally I go into some detail about something I review, but this doesnt have any. Kill the bosses. There. Thats the game. All of it. You can get more out of GTA I assure you.

Pros:
+ Nice Graphics
+ The city is HUGE

Cons:
- The story is a one time play through and the ending is just clich and made me irritated.
- Movement isn't the best in the world.

I give this a 3/5, but make sure you have played all of the best games, the great games, and the good games in the world before going to mediocre."
2115,3,500GB for the PlayStation 4 Console (PS4) is just not enough storage. With the newer games like Call Of Duty Advanced Warfare that take up to 50GB (not including the DLC Maps) 500GB Only holds like 5 games. Need at least 1-2TB storage to save more of the newer games without deleting the older saved games and maps.
2116,3,"This is okay, but tries to appeal to a large age range.  With songs familiar to preschoolers to tweens.  I have a 4 year old, 6 year old, and almost 10 year old.  If they choose songs, then the 10 year old is dancing to the ABC's while the 4 year old is dancing to One Direction (which he doesn't care).  I would prefer a separate preschool specific game and an age appropriate song choice for tweens.  The newer Just Dance 2014 is better in my opinion, but it has songs with content that is not appropriate (in my opinion) for younger kids.

As far as controls, this version is adequate and fun.

Overall, this is okay"
2117,3,good
2118,3,"Dinner last night may have been great, but it's not so great when you heat up the leftovers for supper the next evening. Maybe it's soggy now. Or lukewarm. It just doesn't taste the same, despite consisting of all the same ingredients. Which brings me to ""Bioshock 2."" I loved the original. It was one of the greatest, most original and atmospheric games ever released. It may have been the spiritual successor of the equally amazing ""System Shock"" series, but it was entirely its own thing. As for its sequel, well... I liked Neil Marshall's horror flick ""Descent"" too, but that didn't mean they should have made ""Descent Part II,"" a pointless, unoriginal retread that had very little new to offer, and what was new wasn't very good and reflected negatively on the original. I feel exactly the same way about ""Bioshock 2.""

I never saw the need for a sequel to begin with, in all honesty, as the first ""Bioshock"" wrapped itself up quite well. Now, ""Bioshock Infinite"" is in the works, almost acknowledging that a straight ""Bioshock"" sequel was always a bad idea in much the same way as the ""Prince of Persia"" franchise decided to go back to what worked with ""The Forgotten Sands"" after that next-gen reboot that might as well have played itself. Granted, ""Infinite"" is trading an underwater city for a flying city (very imaginative), but it's DIFFERENT. It has the potential to do what ""Bioshock"" did the first time around -- take what we love about that game but make it fresh again. Basically, everything that, I feel, ""Bioshock 2"" failed to do.

In ""Bioshock 2,"" you get to play as a Big Daddy out to rescue his abducted Little Sister, and that's about as far as the game goes toward forging its own identity. You still tool around in Rapture, which looks almost exactly the same as it did when you last left it. You still scavange everything you can find while squaring off with those Adam-addicted freaks. The gameplay is identical in almost every way, but with one difference -- we've already done this, and there's no compelling reason to do it again when you could just as easily pop your far superior copy of the original ""Bioshock"" in and give it another playthrough. Even the game's most tauted feature, playing as a Big Daddy, is weakly executed. You feel every bit as fragile as you did in the first game, and aside from your armored hands filling the screen, it's hard to tell you're not the same protagonist from game one except for the fact that you can now march around with a Little Sister riding on your shoulder and directing you toward the next source of Adam.

I think critics put on the kiddie gloves when this game stepped into the ring earlier this year. My admiration for the first ""Bioshock"" doesn't cloud my judgment though when it concerns the sequel -- in fact, quite the opposite. The overwhelming feeling of sameness just kept creeping in on me during my time with ""Bioshock 2,"" like I'd done all of this before only better. The first game's story was far superior on top of it -- especially the ""Would you kindly?"" revelation near the end, perhaps gaming's best ever ""Gotcha!"" moment. There are no such moments here, although the chance to see things from an entirely different and very eerie perspective near the game's conclusion is certainly the best moment in ""Bioshock 2."" But it can't hold a candle to learning the truth about your supposed benefactor in the original game.

And that's the problem. There's just not enough that's new here, and what is new just can't compete with what came before. Even the whole playing as a Big Daddy angle, were it executed better, still wouldn't be all that fresh since something similar essentially happens at the end of the first game. Basically, there are two camps of people who ""Bioshock 2"" is for -- those who missed the first one (Why?!), and those who played the first one several times and still can't get their fill of Rapture. On those grounds, this glorified expansion pack is certainly worth its weight in gold. But if you loved the first game, and let's face it you probably did, but expected much more out of a proper sequel, you'll probably be just as disappointed by this return to Rapture as I was. This makes it a hard game for me to actually score, but let me put it this way -- I was playing this and ""Metro 2033"" at around the same time, and constantly found myself being wooed away to the mutant-haunted tunnels of Moscow and turning my back on the undersea mess that was Andrew Ryan's supposed utopia..."
2119,3,"Major graphics upgrade from previous games, and the game play is pretty good. But the match making is slow. With initial bugs being out of the way, it's now shaping up pretty good.

I got the Collector's Edition, And The Figurine has a Defect. The Figure leans so far forward that it can not stand upright to pose properly. In Fact it's top heaviness keeps it from staying on it's stand so it's not able to use the stand and without it, it can not stand up. So I can't use this to pose in my collections. This is the reason for the 3 stars."
2120,3,"The graphics are awesome on this game, however, I consider myself an intelligent person and am an avid role player gamer for many years.  This game is way too difficult.  You have to resort to a cheat/walkthrough to figure out what to do next.  No matter how much I rack my brain in trying to figure out the next step, I find I have to resort to the cheat sheet which isn't what I consider fun.  A game should be challenging for the brain but this is ridiculous."
2121,3,"I had been avoiding buying this game because I was afraid it would be another ""Rocks the 80's"" flavored GH (you know - filler before the next big release of the game) and turns out I should've listened to myself. I finally gave in and bought it yesterday because I really needed some new songs to play, but I should have just rented it. I thought it would tide me over until Rock Band 2 and GH World Tour hit the stores but doesn't have that kind of durability. I beat the game (hard setting) in just a couple of hours, which is not such a bad thing. The bad thing is that I have no desire to go back and play it again. At least with Rocks the 80's the songs are good. I love Aeorsmith, but the majority of the songs on this thing are crap and you just play them because you have to to get to a good song. The difficulty is all over the place - you go from repetetive chords on one song, to a thousand notes all over the fret on the next. And what the fizzle is Run DMC'S King of Rock doing on this game? It's not rock and he's certainly not the king of it. As it is a rap song, not a guitar heavy rock, it's basically four or so minutes (feels like 20) of waiting for the occasional note to appear. I don't even have A.D.D. and my attention span was seriously wavering. The best song on the game is Stone Temple Pilots and it seemed out of place among the other songs. You'd get your money out of a rental, but it really can't justify $50."
2122,3,"Some good and some bad. I am going to try my best summarize to game. The running is new and better than the latest madden games but the problem is that if you play online, it is going to be hard to tackle the player, TRUST ME! Game got harder with players who knows how to run the ball and get away from their opponents. Tackling looks realistic in this game and I will give huge credit to the developers. Blocking is pretty bad still because sometimes linebackers will sneaky go through the linesmen when you do the Toss play and after the getting the ball, the opponent is already there to tackle you. The commentators are the same thing from Madden 13 but they have some new lines but we all the knew that they will say repeatedly the same thing. I was concern about the fans in the stadium are still like Madden 09 fans. I mean why can not improve them. They are apart of the environment in the football game and same goes with the players at the sidelines and they all look ratchet. It is the details that these creators have to fix or improve on to make this game more interesting for us to play even more. The field was okay but I expect better and the graphics were not good on the players. The throwing is really good and no comments about that. Intercepting the ball got really easy in this game. Just hold Y and 80 percent you will catch the ball so if you play online, think twice before you throw that ball because if you are going against opponents who know how to play, you are going to turnovers after turnovers. There are many mistakes in this game that it is hard to explain but if you really like football and madden, then get the game but just be prepare for the mistakes that you have to deal with and I think after these years of making this game, it is not going nowhere. This is almost like Madden 13 with updated players and some new stuff but same problems. Problems like blocking, speed quality, graphics, game play, and bad calls. Not bad game but for me, it is not worth it to buy the game :("
2123,3,"The graphics are worse then CFS 2 (Combat flight simulator 2)and about the same as CFS 1.  In other words, not great.  I think the game developers did not put a lot of effort into this game.  They added some cool airplanes like the ME 262 and the JU 88 and some bombing missions (or more bombing missions) but the games' barely playable.  IF you don't have the first two MS combat flight simulators, get those first not this one!  If you still have XP they will probably run.  CFS 1 runs on windows 7 CFS 2 d0esn't 9haven't tried this one on 7 yet).  So if Win 7 is the only OS you have (i have two hard drives, one loaded with win 7 and the other XP) buy at your own risk, these are all old games and may not work at all on win 7 or Vista.

I like the first two CFS games so much, I bought a used logitech wingman force feedback joystick (i had one before so i knew it would probably work on XP, and it does) from amazon for $30 and these games are MUCH more fun with the force feedback.  Through the stick, you feel the guns hammer, you feel the pull on turns.  When you land on the carrier deck (CFS 2 only) you feel the wheels hit and the cable pulling you back.  It's fun.  I recommend it and logitech still supports XP and  you can download the drivers from their site.  On win 7, this old joystick works but has no force feedback.  If you have a force feedback joystick these games support that."
2124,3,"While I liked the idea, game play was a little difficult and monotonous at times. Fighting the bosses is simply finding your trick and doing it over and over again... Game difficulty was actually pretty tough as well!"
2125,3,"This is a pretty fun game, and at the time it was released, the best of it's ilk. It's since (imo) been surpassed by the likes of Big Brain Academy, which really takes the genre a lot further in terms of multiplayer and content."
2126,3,"I have to admitt, I was very nervous about trying out this game because of how much people seemed to hate it with a passion.  This game is NOT garbage, but still is a piece of art that perhaps needed more work done to it.
  First of all, I thought the music was gorgeous and the watercolor type graphics were amazing.  I couldn't help but drop my jaw when I saw some of the movie sequences when the bright colors filled the screen.  Character expressions were grand and the voices were done quite well.  However, most of the game was not done like this.  You saw only a picture, (still beautiful) of the towns and characters.  You got little to no choices of where to move.  When you entered the a town, you never explored it, talked to random NPCs, instead you looked at a picture of the place and selected areas of the town to enter.
  The battles were quite fun, but I wish I could've been able to cure myself.  The monsters and battle animations were done well also.  However, you can't escape from battle which makes me almost irrate at times when I get into too many battles.
You get to choose which character you are, and the story is different for each.  This is a great quality.
  When you move around a dungeon, your character looks like a silver chest piece and you lift the piece to move onward on a single colored maze.  In the corner of the screen is a drawn picture of what the place ""would look like""
  I say that it seemed to be cut short, because every intention of the game was wonderful.  The ability to choose your hero, the graphics, music, and even some aspects of the battle system were good.  However, I felt trapped in the game world, (not in a good way) because I was unable to explore the world more, and save myself from battles by escaping or curing.  I don't want this to sound too harsh, but it was like being in a large prison.  You couldn't explore beyond the maze of prison bars, despite how nice it seemed inside.  I wanted so much more from this game, but it just didn't have it.
  I do respect the attempt, and what it really does have to offer.  Rent before buying.  But still, give it a look."
2127,3,it's ok
2128,3,"Besides the complaing about the price and lack of...well everything, my biggest complaint is that the songs on here, may be fun to listen to on the radio, but are super boring/annoying to play. Besides ""Only a Lad"" ""Play with me"" and a very few others these are just really strange choices. I mean Flock of Seagulls? Come On! Shouldn't that be on Keyboard Hero or something... I had to turn off ""Because it's midnight"" I was so bored with it.
I've played Guitar Hero, and own Guitar Hero 2, and if you don't own the latter, GET IT. Totally awesome. Tons of songs, super fun to play. Really great.
Anyway, here's to hoping Guitar Hero 3 blows me away."
2129,3,"Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which is a shame considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game. While Cold Fear does not exactly establish itself as a high-quality survival horror game, the involved story and occasional interesting gameplay element make Cold Fear worth playing, for at least a little while, anyway.

  They got the cold part right.  In Cold Fear, you play as Tom Hansen, a US Coast Guard officer who has been sent to investigate a mysterious Russian frigate on a windy and stormy night in the middle of the ocean. You find out early on that the boat is occupied not merely by hostile Russian soldiers, of which there are plenty, but also by alien creatures that feed on the humans and provide a severe threat from both inside and outside their host bodies. Your investigation leads you to a few friendly faces and many threatening ones as you uncover the mystery of the ship and its lethal cargo.

  The perspective is third person, with the ability to go into a first-person aiming mode through which you can freely guide your view. Although the fixed camera gives a wider glimpse of the scene, it's not easy to keep fluid control when going back and forth between cameras, which is a problem as you try to maneuver around the boat and take out the enemies you encounter along the way.

  Additional controls let you crouch, run, and scroll quickly through weapons, which is slightly more intuitive in the PS2 version, thanks to the extra trigger buttons. However, since the weapon scroll is placed on the white/black buttons on the Xbox controller, the difference is not that severe. Running brings up an onscreen meter that, when depleted, prohibits you from running anymore. This helps to make certain puzzles more challenging, and you will find yourself monitoring the meter frequently, but it does not detract from or add to the gameplay in any significant way.

Because Cold Fear takes place in ocean-locked environments, the control scheme is affected by the movement of the waves. This is mostly noticeable when you are outside, and at times it looks like you're walking almost completely sideways, due to the volatile movement of the deck beneath you. This adversely impacts the controls, but the trade-off is a unique and interesting component of the gameplay. As you fight against the tossing of the boat, timing yourself to cross decks only when the waves are low, you encounter some of the most compelling aspects of Cold Fear. Unfortunately, the outside environments are not tapped to their fullest, and you'll spend the majority of the game, past the first hour, in generic indoor locations.

Your objective in Cold Fear is to discover the story behind the vessel's apparent destruction and the emergence of the nonhuman creatures upon it. Despite being a highly derivative story about a genetic experiment gone wrong, the relationship between characters is interesting, and the story is neat and simple. Most of the plot exploration is conveyed through notes that are littered about the environment and through dialogues with characters (for the short duration that the people on the boat other than Hansen manage to stay alive). The notes are well implemented, and they drive the story and reveal critical information about weapons, environmental objects, and enemies.

Although you start off with merely a handgun, there are a number of different weapons to be found in the middle of the ocean, including a submachine gun, an AK-47, a speargun, a flamethrower, and a grenade launcher. The weapons are almost all equally effective, except for differences in power. The speargun is the only weapon that is not used explicitly for dealing damage, and when fired, it releases a gas that draws enemies near it. This is a great tactic to use in conjunction with one of the more explosive weapons such as the shotgun or grenade launcher. Otherwise, the objective of the game is to make headshots on all humanoid enemies, which can be exceedingly difficult as the enemies draw nearer to you. Fortunately, most of the weapons have either a laser sight or flashlight, which aids your precision. The point of the headshot is to conserve ammunition, although enemies will not die unless they are decapitated. This means that if you shoot an enemy anywhere other than in the head, and merely knock it down to the ground, you have a certain amount of time to run over and step on the head before the enemy gets back up and attacks you again.

Many of the zombies are possessed by exocel creatures, which are spidery beings that alternate between crawling on the floor and the ceiling before attempting to take possession of a human being by reaching out a long tendril into a human's mouth and then climbing inside. Outside of a host body, these exocels are fairly easy to destroy--usually one bullet sends them rolling up into a ball, and a second one takes them out--but given their flexibility and their penchant for appearing out of nowhere, including bodies you've just killed, they provide a formidable threat if not dealt with quickly. More advanced abominations of genetics appear later on, but with the more difficult enemies, it's sometimes easier to merely avoid confrontation and run along to the next room. If you choose to run, you'll find these creatures often jumping on your back. When this happens, you're given a button sequence to throw the enemy and try to achieve a critical hit. If you successfully land a critical hit, enemies are killed much more quickly than if you had gone about it the normal way. Because of this, it's sometimes tactically important to let Hansen be jumped by enemies, as long as you can throw them quickly.

Hansen knows a ballet bar when he sees one.

Other game tactics include using pieces of the environment to do the work for you. You can shoot explosive barrels, fire extinguishers, and different-colored valves to create an environmental trap for oncoming enemies. From time to time, you'll encounter a fight between two of the enemy species, and you can let them fight among themselves before you intervene. Environmental effects, such as laser beams and swinging obstacles, can often be used to pick off the less bright enemies, and the rocking of the boat will send a zombie or you overboard, if you're standing on the wrong side of a slippery surface."
2130,3,"Both Fable I and Fable II could have been all time best RPG games if enough clues had been available within the games to play and complete the games with out resorting to walk through guides. I would purchase and play another Fable sequal, a Fable III if you may."
2131,3,"A little hard to get use to the layout of the board, but to be fair it is a solid board."
2132,3,"It's ok, but I don't see what all the hype was about"
2133,3,"If you're a Final Fantasy fan, then this game is just what you'd expect.  It immerses you in a beautiful fantasy world, richly detailed and innovatively imagined.  One thing I really like about this MMORPG that makes it unique is that it actually has a story.  The RPG genre just doesn't feel quite right without a story, but Final Fantasy knows exactly how to put meaning and context into all that fighting and leveling.

The battle system could be described as typical Final Fantasy mixed together with the usual MMORPG battle system that you find in Everquest, Anarchy Online, and World of Warcraft.  The class system is perfect.  You level up as a class rather than a character, and you can switch classes if you like.  For instance, if you're a level 12 black mage, you can switch over to white mage where you will start out as a level 1.  You can go back to being a level 12 black mage later if you like.

I do have some complaints, though.  The game has many clipping errors, which is disappointing considering the high quality I've come to expect form Final Fantasy games.  There are many, many, many items and equipment to collect in the game, but you can only store or carry very few.

The absolute worse thing about this game is the walking.  Most MMORPG's have vehicles, horses, teleportation, or some other way to get from one place to another.  Only very high level white mages can teleport in this game, and the rest of us have to walk everywhere.  This means that it's not uncommon to spend half an hour walking just to meet a friend, buy something you need, go to the next place to level, and so forth.  This problem alone was so irritating that it was the reason I gave up this otherwise very fun game."
2134,3,Well When i first played Spyro for  the playstation I thought It was pretty good. So When i got my Gc and this game came out i said ok ill get it. I have never been so disapinted with a game in my life. The game Doesnt take advantage of the Gamecube at all. The game is not smooth the game is really choppy and full of bugs.  If you are a hardcore spyro fan then get it. But if you are just looking for a fun game forget this one. get Mech assault or metroid prime .
2135,3,"I want to say first, that I will update this as I get more well acquainted with the game...

But, I want to highlight that a feature has been added that I haven't heard anyone mention in reviews or even from the developers: Bat speed. Different players have different bat speeds, and I never would've thought of this being a big deal, but it makes the hitting much more realistic. For instance, Giancarlo Stanton will be able to turn on a fastball much faster than Jon Lester. This brings an interesting dynamic to batting through the order, but also makes it easier to connect with the better hitters once you get used to it. This is how it should be. Batting is no longer the same timing and just looking for location as before, it's a welcome addition to the game.

Update 4/1/15 - 4/2/15
After spending some more time with this game, it's basically the same as every other year thus far. It's a great sim but it isn't as much fun as some other baseball games I have played. This game graphically and in terms of being a sim is excellent, but it can be boring/frustrating at times. Games are supposed to be for fun, but this errs on the side of being a sim. Expect to be frustrated by the other team's pitcher when facing their Ace. You'll be lucky to get a hit or two (unless you change the sliders) until the 9th inning, where the opposing pitcher probably has only thrown like 65 pitches. I take more pitches than a lot of other people probably do and try to run up the count to get the guy out of there, but still get frustrated by facing the equivalent of a fresh Ace in the bottom of the 8th with 1 hit for the entire game.

I have raised the rating up to a 4. First game was brutal because of pitching, ended 1-0 but I got a walkoff HR which felt like a gimme. It's a sim, and I was forced to make some trades for my beloved Dodgers. I also had an elbow injury in the first start for Greinke and was left with a sorry rotation. It's a good game, just expected to be bored or frustrated at times.

Update 4/8/15
Online experience is still terrible as it was last year. It seems like they want certain teams to win. They issue walks on strikes in the zone, and clearly in the zone at that (I'm not talking about borderline pitches). The dude I was playing flat out swung multiple times and went all the way around and the ump said it was a check swing. MAYBE, he checked his swing on his end, but what I saw on my screen was a full swing, multiple times. Players completely miss the ball even though they are standing on the marker in the outfield as if they never saw it, etc... Horribly frustrating and crappy experience online playing this game.

I ended up trading the game in. I'll wait until the price is lower before buying it again to finish my franchise."
2136,3,"i may not know how to use it properly but sometimes my battery is charged and others is low, i don't know what the deal is but i can't really say much because i don't play my wii much anymore. however proper use and instalment might be the differenece i'll try it when i set up my wii again."
2137,3,"The main game was pretty good over all however it was about 5-6 hours if you play thru it non-stop without saving. The MP(multi-player) part of the game seems a bit lacking to me, its as if they just took one of their older games and updated it, there is nothing that really explodes out and says ""Hey you'll wanna play me!!"". Then we have the co-op sub games where its almost exactly like Modern Warfare 3's one where you just fight enemies and upgrade you're exo, which isn't that bad but i would have liked it if they had something that was just totally different then the same old COD game play.

I want to like this game, each time i play it i have this feeling that i will enjoy playing MP games like team death match's and such but after just a few games i have to just stop because its all so familiar to me like all the past COD games i have played.

Pros: Main game was great, loved the story and had fun playing it!
(Don't really have any major details besides that about pros).

Cons: The game play is too short for such a huge game roll out, however you could say that the last game wasn't as long since it wasn't but it just felt like that.
MP (mult-player) games seem to much alike Ghost.
----------------------------------
Last note, for what you are paying i wouldn't advise you to buy the pro edition of this game since there is not a whole lot of extra things you are going to get for the money you'll be paying. I would suggest watching some game play or trying out a friends copy before you buy to ensure you will like what you're getting."
2138,3,One of my favorites. I just wish it would continue where bI left off.
2139,3,I bought the console hooked it up and it was fairly simple. I had to do a update for the console but it was software only so that should always be noted when buying this product. Along with that I was very upset with the fact that I got a $10.00 gift card free to the store but to later find out that it expired last year of 3/31/15 so that was a little upsetting.
2140,3,"Despite enjoying rpgs I was not a big fan of oblvion's prequels. I didn't really enjoy this game much either.
It's huge and has a ton of quests, the vast majority being optional. However I found the majority of the quests, and I did them nearly all of them, to be boring and tedious. It's mostly fetch this or kill that. Vary few of the quests have any kind of an intriguing storyline. The monsters or foes are many but they are very repetitive and simply tougher and slightly different versions of each other.
There is very little significant NPC interaction, and the graphics of people are repetitive and somewhat cartoonish. There is very little choice on how you complete quests. You can ride a steed, but you cannot fight while on one, and they wander off once you get off them. Also get your skill up and you can move as fast or faster on foot.
The map is huge and there's plenty to find, but you can spend hours playing this game and accomplish nothing.
You have to design your character well at the beginning, based on the skills you will use or you will never level up. This is hard, because you do not know, if you are new to the game, what skills you are going to be using.
The combat is largely hack and slash with no real difference between weapons. The weapons and armor are largely repetitive and just different versions of each other.
There are a number of special items to acquire. Unfortunately some of them are really difficult and not worth the trouble versus what you get. Also some of the best weapons and armor in the game can be had rather early, which makes acquiring new stuff rather pointless."
2141,3,"This was a very unique game back on n64 now we see wierd games like this all the time just mabe not as violent. This is a prety fun game and interesting for about 15 minuts then you just wana turn it off and get sick of seein the same anoyin ass tediz come after you. It has its ups like its fun and has a mix of every kind of game play from difrent genres which is cool but it doesnt realy mix it all together realy good and the story doesnt make very much sense or has any meaning. The best part of this game are graphics which are very good and clear , but that isn't enough to buy this game, it is for sure not worth the dam 50$ price its worth a rental and thats about it. They tried to make the online play a key part and make it fun but it just isn't , it gets old quick and its prety much the same thing over and over and i would like to pick a difrent person while im still in the battle, but the m player is just prety lame and not very inventive and when theres halo2 online this game looks like a joke. So don't buy this game for 50 bucks wait till its cheper or just rent it ."
2142,3,"Well, I played the first two episodes of this on the Xbox back in the day and even enjoyed the little card game a few years back.  However, I was somewhat disappointed at this one...

The first thing to note is that this series is meant for online play and PSU is a pseudo-MMO.  That means all the players do not share one world, but instances of areas for each group with a central chat/lobby.

Although PSU has a very comprehensive character creation process online, in single player, you get stuck with some guy in a hoodie who thumbs his nose like Cid from Kingdom Hearts (or rather he tries to dislocate his nose with his knuckles)...  The gameplay becomes repetitive with only boss monsters offering a different style of combat for players.  Unfortunately, there are only about a dozen of those around.

The controls also leave a lot to be desired.  The entire d-pad is unused on the main screen as well as L2/R2 buttons.  You can't create custom key mappings to actually link useful commands to them like switching with the next weapon down the list or use a monomate.  This is important because to navigate the palette, you have to use the d-pad which makes it difficult to dodge attacks when in combat.  And chances are most of the times you need to heal is in combat with a boss where dodging is very important.

In conclusion, this is a great game if you plan on going online and paying the fee.  If you're looking for single player action, you might want to look elsewhere."
2143,3,"Does the job, just wish it wasn't necessary, or that Kinect was never included for Xbox One in the first place."
2144,3,3/5
2145,3,"i waited 12 years for this to come out just like everyone else,  disappointed with this game!  Single player campaign is way too short.  I think it took me 17 hours  to beat.  Mostly because 75% of the missions have 30 minute time limits.  This game is very much geared towards the people who have played and mastered the game.  Even set on slow pace the game is fast and you really need to pay attention and use the hot keys to help you play.  The old gem was way more fun and  you could slow things down and take your time to plan and prepare for a battle.  here you need to rush through everything at break neck speed.  The graphics are solid and easy to navigate around the map.  the story line is solid and entertaining.
The game is also more geared for online multi-player mode.  there are tons of maps and battles to join online, since i am not really into massive online play i didn't really get into it.  They set it up to be kind of like halo in this aspect and thats too bad because it left the campaign or single player mode something to be desired.  It was not very long, it was a bit repetitive and needed more maps and missions for the price."
2146,3,"It's a fun game but is a bit short. I never played Co-op so I am not sure if that adds something to it I kind of doubt it. There will be points where you will want to rage quit and throw the controller against the wall, however it is a lot of fun to collect all the different yoshi's and a lot of innovation in the levels which is more then I can say for those new super mario bros games which nintendo needs to stop with allready."
2147,3,"Xbox One Elite, Awesome controller, I do notice load times to be a tad faster than the base model. however with the current cost of a regular Xbox one, this should only be purchased by those that demand the very best of everything.

Docked two stars on Price to value"
2148,3,"The left analogue stick is a little loose and causes anywhere from minimal to massive character wonder in some games.  The controller also could have been cleaned a little better.  The thought of getting years of 13 year old finger sweat / grime buildup on my hands grosses me out.  However, the fact still remains that these were the cheapest used controllers on here, so there is that as a bright side.  Aside from that, the controller works fine and connected right up to my PC's wireless XBOX controller USB receiver."
2149,3,"I've been playing FPS since the days of Doom. I've played my fair share of bad games (or course it is all opinion) and my fair share of good ones (my favorite is still Rogue Spear). MOH not  horrible game, but it tries to be like too much like MWF2 but lacks the ""tension"" in the SP. These games are like playing a movie, which is cool, but it has to be done right. MOH seems to fall short with respect to that. Character dev, story line, all that is not that great. This game has a good MP but it is nothing you can't get with BC2. In fact BC2 is better IMO.

Yes thw SP game is scripted to high heaven, even moreso than MWF2 and it did get frustrating at time because there is no real good way to see what they want you to do.

Regardless, this is a decent game that would be worth picking up when it is drastically reduced, but not for what it is currently being offered now."
2150,3,"Just finished the campaign on xbox360...I don't play online, so I won't mention that.
I had a good time with the ""Alien"" level; it wasn't a bad time at all creeping up on people and shreddin' em. The ""Colonial Marine"" campaign was...blah. I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could be a MONSTER.
Then the ""Predator"" campaign...
In my opinion, this was...well, damned difficult. The controls were clunky, and he seemed one-dimensional and lame, like an annoying, weak Colonial Marine. Everything can see past the cloak, so it was next to useless, and I found myself losing my cool because of it. That's not the way I want to spend time playing games...dissatisfied and frustrated.
I wish I'd rented it first. It's re-playablity is almost non-existent. I'm going back to my Left 4 Dead 2.
Ellis would kick the butt of EVERYONE in AVP.
All he'd need is his paddlebat, too."
2151,3,"Unlike wines, Jedi Outcast was probably better appreciated when it first came out back in 2002. I played it for the first time this year and while it was fun I can't say I love it. If anything, I enjoyed it mostly because it gave me a nostalgia trip for the original Dark Forces game, which was one of my first computer games back in 1996.

Jedi Outcast looks and feels dated even though it's been less than a decade. Yes, games age, but even games like KOTOR and Rogue Squadron, which came out around the same time, still look and feel great. By contrast, the graphics in Jedi Outcast just look blocky and flat. The locations are generic. There are even some familiar locales, like Bespin, but you're pretty much stuck in a bunch of rooms that look no different from the Imperial ship later in the game (compare that to the Bespin in the Force Unleashed Wii games, which actually does look like Bespin).

However, what really frustrated me was the gameplay. The lightsaber combat is uneven and unwieldy. Jumping isn't very precise, which is a big problem because Jedi Outcast thinks it's a platforming game. You often have to make precise jumps onto narrow ledges. This led to no small amount of frustration.

I'm not sure why some people rave about the story. The story is pretty rote - the princess (Jan Ors) gets captured, and the hero (Kyle Katarn) has to go find his sword (lightsaber), track down the evil king (Dark Lord Desann), and rescue her. You don't have any choice in the story or outcomes. Even worse, some of the movie characters act out of character. Luke Skywalker seemingly has no problem with Kyle going out looking for revenge against Desann. Lando

Perhaps I've just been spoilt by recent games like the Force Unleashed and KOTOR and Rogue Squadron, which have great graphics, controls, and stories. I'm glad I tried Jedi Outcast just to see what ever happened to Kyle. I loved shooting Stormtroopers Dark Forces style. But with so many great Star Wars games out there, this one should probably be pretty low on your list.

2152,3,"Buyer Beware!!!

This deluxe edition claims to have the booster pack Northern Strike as well but either this is not the case or EA has some serious problems here. Just search the internet and you will find numerous threads on this issue with the game deluxe edition.

In short, the game installs fine claiming that you are getting both the orginal version as well as the booster pack. However, once you are done activating and registering your account you can ONLY play the orginal BF2142 maps with no issues. But once you try to access any of the Northern Strike booster pack maps the game acts like you don't have the booster pack installed and directs you to EA link to purchase it even though the deluxe edition should have installed the booster pack already. I have sent lots of emails to EA but all i am getting are useless automated or cut & paste responses. As of now there is no real resolution to this issue. If EA helps me out I will update my post otherwise think before buying.

Other than that an awesome game. The titan mode is the real winner here. I have been involved in some serious fights around and inside the Titan for supermacy. You have 14 maps of intense battles and the game rewards the players who played the most with more effective weapons as well as armor unlocks and a persistent talent system. I will however, seriously recommend all newbies(until you have unlocked some weps and armor too) to stick with armored vehicles and only try to engage one-on-one if you have the advantage or are in a group. Otherwise you will be relentlessly farmed by players who have uber weapons than you for a very long time."
2153,3,"I played the demo for Supreme Commander 2 but couldn't find the one for the original Supreme Commander. I thought the the reviews had to be off because I thought the demo was good. I did however buy Supreme Commander, it's expansion Forged Alliance, and Supreme Commander 2 at the same time. I played through them in order as one should and some of the reviews here are correct about Supreme Commander 2. It is very lacking compared to Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance. They are much better. It seems to me that the company just through this game together and didn't put much thought into it. There are changes that I did like. The interface is a little better, there is a research tree (does seem to be lacking a little),  and you have a better view of your buildings and things you manufacture. Graphics aren't too bad either. Where they went wrong: you are limited in what you buildings can produce; there isn't a tech level any longer so your turrets and anti-air is at the same level throughout; you can't double up on engineers to build or repair buildings and vehicles; this is mainly a land battle, so if you expect to have a navy don't unless you multiply or skirmish. Been through the campaign and only had to have a navy once; the story line just sucks. It's an ok game but would have been very pissed if I had paid full release price."
2154,3,"i like rayman games, and i was hoping rayman 3d was going to be a new history, but NO!!! i don't know why nintendo likes to do remake and remake and remake of all games, we are waiting for new adventures, i like to play old games but not always. the game is fun but we need new adventures.."
2155,3,"This controller is not too bad... I have used it pretty extensively and the buttons hold up well. The main problem with this controller is the absolutely abysmal D-Pad. It consistently has issues knowing which direction you are pressing down.

Take Castlevania for instance... Most of the time you hold the D-Pad, it is either in one direction, right or left, and use B to whip. well unfortunately most of the time the D-Pad thinks you are holding up as well as holding left or right, so you always use your special weapon instead. Mega man 2 will consistently turn around on me, so if I am shooting at a boss or jumping from platform to platform, I almost always end up dying unless I am holding the D-Pad down with massive strength in the direction I want it to go. Sometimes it is also hard to select the items in the options menu because it will go either up or down. If I want item-1, it will go down to item-2 and vice versa.

The D-pad works when it wants to, and most of the time it is lazy. The buttons are decent. A and B work well and feel good. Start and Select are a bit flimsy but I have put them to the test and they hold up very well. The controller feels close to the original NES design except for the garbage D-Pad.

If you can find another NES controller that has better reviews, I would choose that over this one. If you are looking for a good controller to play NES games on or to use with other games (such as Master System), look elsewhere. This thing is just too hard to work with and takes the fun out of our old classic games. I think i'd rather use the power glove... =/"
2156,3,"On the small side, If you have a big dome like I do try the Mono tritom."
2157,3,"This game is good. The gameplay mechanics are solid. The graphics are decent, the frame rate is solid. It is truly well polished. It lacks a strong single player component. Everything is challenges. A game like this craves some sort of story mode, and it isn't present. Instead - there is a Mario Party style board game. There isn't even a 10 round match type game like in Tekken or other fighters.

It was disappointing, but perhaps I put it on too high of a pedestal after Melee and Brawl."
2158,3,"My Son likes it but the 3D is the down side, because if you move your head away and look back at the screen you need to find the right place to see the 3D and after a while your head hurts from just trying to lock in the 3D. So I just tell him to take the #d effect off."
2159,3,I like the graphics and the story line. The only mark downs are its very repetitive(button smasher) and the story line is very short. I bought it in the morning and traded it back in six hours later. That's how short the game is. I would recommend it to any one to rent because you can easily beat it in a day. Not worth the full $60 to buy it brand new unless you like the multiplayer which is very repetitive too. Save your money and Red Box/Game fly it.
2160,3,It is hard to complete.  I like the game and the cars in it.  It is an ok game but not my favorite.
2161,3,"I love that this is a FPS but, If you die you start the board all over again. after awhile of going thru this you stop playing and do something else, or play another game. which i personally don't like to do if im in the middle of playing a game that i just open and didn't finish. the story line keeps me coming back for more, graffic's are good not great. anyway time to get thru the game and move on."
2162,3,"This console was a bit of a downer.  New games are great, look nice, and the menu interface is better... however... Microsoft is incredibly slow with the backwards compatibility growth for 360 games.  My children have just about all of the lego games and I think the only one that actually works is the lego movie one... IRRITATING!"
2163,3,Got this for my son but its cumbersome to run and play and he really never has used it with the frequency of FS
2164,3,"it is really fun to play, but to be a 2006 game graphic is not so great: I mean, compared to Mafia is better overall, but most of the moves are not that realistic, like fights,or how cars handle..the customization is cool but...I feel like its price is not really worth it. Bottom line is: enjoyable, but not impressive."
2165,3,"This game should have been better that it was - it had great potential. The story was good, the graphics were excellent, the acting so-so. Like others that played this game, I have to agree that the dialogue was terrible. At times there were up eight different dialogue choices - pick the wrong one and end up at a dead end. The flow of the dialogue sometimes made no sense or was contradictory. I did enjoy the French accents, though.
The inventory was a real pain - you end up collecting quite a few objects and have to go though them one at a time to find the item you need. When an item is just entered into inventory and you want to access it, it should be the first available item. It's not - for some reason I always ended up going though all the items just to look at the newest item.
The music also got very annoying after a while. There is an option to turn it down and I had it at the lowest setting but I still found it intrusive.
Even with these criticisms I would still recommend the game and I enjoyed it anyway."
2166,3,"Too big, definitely need 10 keyless for those MASSIVE SWIPES in CS."
2167,3,"Not much difference in this game from the original. Had some difficulty with the controls, especially switching weapons... The original was a nightmare... Hitman 47 and IGI were both nightmares! I kept playing them until I couldn't stand it anymore...  The controls were terrible and I still see some problems with it in this game... The game is interesting and it's definitely fun to blow somebody away, but the controls are still a bit awkward... I'm on the fence with this one folks...You might find it a lot of fun and manage to work the controls better than me. EADOS needs to do some work on this game before it's really top notch... It has the makings of an excellent game with some deficiencies...primarily contols... The demo didn't allow me to save either, n'or did the first Hitman game. Like IGI, EADOS was supposed to have addressed that issue in the new game..."
2168,3,"I like it ok but is harder to play than Ps2.

 I wish it was easier.

 Therefor I give three stars only."
2169,3,"It is not as good as the other Super Granny games, mostly too slow, and I do not like the childish, pastel color scheme or other designs."
2170,3,"As one reviewer pointed out, you should hook this thing up and set it up before the kids get to it.  They'll get bored pretty quicky with all of the waiting they'll have to do with registering, updating, etc.

The console itself is very slow compared to the original Wii.  Yes, I realize the games are more complex and thus larger files.  But going from game to game, menu to menu just takes so long.

And the battery in the GamePad doesn't last but a couple hours.  We'll leave it on the charger all night, get up and play Wii Fit U for a couple hours (which doesn't even use the GamePad exclusively) and we'll get a low battery warning.

I'm glad that Nintendo finally upgraded the Wii and ""fixed"" some of the things that were wrong with the original, but they could've done a better job."
2171,3,"Very entertaining and mixes investigation, story and puzzles nicely. The graphics are not that good and gameplay sometimes limited."
2172,3,"I was extremely skeptical about getting Zestiria for the longest time after hearing the backlash from Japanese fans with the handling of certain main characters but by the time I got Zestiria when it was selling for cheap I found that there was more than the character problem at hand.

As a long time 'Tales of' fan I felt devastated that the series was never going to make another landing in the west after Vesperia, until the releases of the mediocre 'Graces f' that actually helped the series continue in the west. After a few disappointing releases I was stoked to hear about Zestiria back when it was announced late 2012 when I was sitting in my Marine Biology class. I couldn't wait for this fresh new entry that was going to be ""open world""

I was disappointed by the time I got the game moreso cause it wasn't structured like any of the stellar Tales games I've played notably Abyss & Vesperia, the combat was fine but the rest of the game just felt lazily slopped together. Skits were clumped to save points and it made watching them feel like a waste of your own time and the story never had a striking pivotal moment that most JRPGs do.  The story laid flat on the ground hours after hours and not only that but the characters were never intriguing or held my interest. I gave up on Zestiria after the game made me obligated to backtrack to places for no real reason.

This had to be the most lackluster entry in the series since 'Graces f' and I was extremely disappointed that this game had a Tales name to it and the massive amount of filler content to extend an already short game. This is not a game to introduce yourself to the series."
2173,3,"This is a 2D side scrolling game, if you want anything like the original ones go out and buy a Nintendo 64 or PS1. Otherwise it is like the original in the general art style and the fact that it doesn't have any speech, just bubbles and random mumbling."
2174,3,"In an effort to teach my teenagers some defensive driving skills, I invested in a Playstation 3 and bought Gran Turismo 5.  I knew this would be a racing, reckless driving kind of game, but maybe they could have some fun while they learned.  I blew through quite a bit of money for the game consul, steering wheel, and game, only to find out that I could have saved a lot of money and gotten exactly what I wanted with SimuRide Home Edition.  They play this game more than they do the Playstation game, and it can be set to the proper level for each of my kids."
2175,3,"I am a huge final fantasy fan and always loved ffX but had never played the sequel before. I hate X2. it sucks, it's childish and meant to reel in pre teen females in my opinion. X2 is so bad, that even though I tried really hard to make myself play through, I could only stand it for about 20 minutes until I had enough. I am going to try to get my 9 year old granddaughter to play it through so she can tell me the storyline haha. She will probably like that stupid dancing thing they do."
2176,3,"With the combo of Squaresoft and Disney putting together an action RPG I sort of expected a whimsical gaming romp through a cotton-candy, brightly hued world full of laughs and amusements galore.  Was I ever surprised to discover that the finished product was mostly set in a dark, evil environment with difficult/challenging gameplay and a steep learning curve.  I'm guessing that a lot of 1st time RPG'ers probablly took a stab at this game with the belief that if it's a Disneyesque game how hard can it be? - only to quit the game midway through in frustration.
In a nutshell this game is no leisurely stroll through the Magic Kingdom.  While Disney afficionados will no doubt be thrilled to explore worlds ranging from 'Aladdin,' to 'Nightmare Before Christmas,' they will just as well be shocked at the level of difficulty that players will be required to overcome.  Because of this, I would certainly not recommend this title to small children along with inexperienced gamers - which is quite ironic considering that this is the very demographic you would think the game would've been targeted towards.
For the more hardcore gamer I would recommend the experience - 40 hour commitment notwithstanding.  Aside from the degrees of frustration you will face - there are also nuggets of memorable gameplay scattered throughout.  The summon spells utilizing Disney characters is one of them, and the gameplay set in the 'Winnie the Pooh' world offers a nice respite from the more frenzied settings in most of the game.  My chief complaint though is the awful game camera.  Much to my dismay, I found myself on the brink of motion-sickness on more then several occassions.  While the game falls short of the mark, i do have to give kudos to Squaresoft for attempting to take the risk of subverting the norms of the 'Disney' genre somewhat.  With that in mind I certainly look forward to seeing the sequel."
2177,3,"Unless you live under a rock you know a little bit about ""American Idol"".  Its exactly like the show.  You make an avatar and sing your heart out and yes....you are judged.  Good selection of songs and levels to compete at.  Fun for all ages!"
2178,3,"Good game for the PS2, but I couldn't really get into it. Not my kind of game, and that's after I thought this would be different from most JRPGs. While it certainly is, it still has all the quirks that JRPGs like to irritate me with. Simple put; if you don't like JRPGs, then this definitely won't change your mind, but if you do then this is a unique take on the formula."
2179,3,Bought for my son. Not sure if he even plays it so I can't give a good review. Sorry.
2180,3,Good DDR game. I wasn't as big of a fan of the music selections.
2181,3,"My wife was somewhat excited to finally check out this game.  I'll admit - so was I.

I was impressed at how well the steering worked.  Now, renting it, we didn't get a wheel, but I was glad to see that you can hold the wiimote flat - buttons up - and tilt it side to side just as well as you can hold it buttons-facing-you and tilt it.  Once I learned this, it became more comfortable to play.

But it didn't become more fun.  There seems to be some argument over the value of the game as a single-player.  I can say first-hand that we had more fun playing together than either of us did on our own.

Mario Kart Wii just bombards you.  You can be sitting in first place, minding your business, just driving along when a Koopa shell hits you.  You fly into the air, land on your wheels, your character shakes his head, and WAM - some ""POW"" block goes off, sending you flying into the air again.  You land, shake your head, and WHACK - another character smacks into you, forcing you to wait while the car spins in place - shake your head AGAIN - and finally drive off.  You're now last place, and have sat there for probably 10 seconds while shouting ""Come on!!!!""

This doesn't happen ALL the time, but you can be confident that when it does, you'll be restarting the race, or quitting altogether.  Sometimes you can get out of this - the best (and really only way I've seen so far) is if you're carrying a Koopa shell yourself - you can launch it backwards to thwart off the first attack.  However, with the POW block, the ink-squirting squid, and the homing ""blue shell"" that's been mentioned elsewhere, you're pretty much S.O.L.  The only good thing is that with some of the attacks - like the POW block, the lightning bolt - it affects everyone around you.  So unless the second place character launched it, you probably won't lose your position.  But in general it becomes frustrating, and I don't think that randomly generated ""frustration"" equates to what some might consider a ""challenge.""

Now, I don't want to hear any of you Wii-addicts start going on about ""Oh you have to have the skill.""  I've said it once and I'll say it again - you're controlling a little cartoon character in a go-kart by tilting a piece of plastic.  There's little skill involved.  I drive a 2000 Dodge Viper GTS coupe - I truly understand the art of ""driving skills.""  Mario Kart Wii is nothing like driving a Dodge Viper!  :)

I think the game would be fun with a lot of people - when it's more of a free-for-all, and not the computer SEEMING like it gangs up on the human player.  But I played it for maybe 2, 3 hours, and I'm done.  I won't play it again, and I won't miss it.  On a good note, it's presentation, control interface, and playability is better than most Wii games to date.  My demerits are more against content and gameplay than anything else.  It works very well - it just irritates you in the process!

I won't say skip it.  It might be just your cup of tea.  Just maybe rent it before you buy.  These days, it's very easy to waste money on video games."
2182,3,"Let's leave the gameplay discussion for last...

The graphics and sound are nice. The voice work is really well done and the characters have personalities all their own. The places they go to and the enemies they fight are varied and interesting. The animations could use some work and come across a little weak. Buying items and skills, which not much of a tactical consideration, spices things up. The music works well without being overpowering. Unfortunately the game isn't long at all and has no replay value aside from the sheer spectacle.

That being said, Demon Stone might be a guilty pleasure. In actuality, this game is nothing short of a frustrating example of bad control, lacklustre gameplay and depressing boss battles.

You will be spitting out the same 2 or 3 attack combinations throughout the entire game. To break up the monotony, your attacks don't track the nearest enemy... they swing where you point the controls. With the camera in really bad places half the time, with monsters moving erratically and with the analog control being so wishy-washy (never aims where you think you are), simple attack button repetitions become hair-pulling exercises in anger management.

Top it all off with the worst boss battles I've seen in many a year. Bosses resort to cheap 'tactics' of invulnerability and paralyzing the character you are controlling. Give the player about 2 seconds to do any damage, then rinse and repeat. This goes for nearly EVERY boss at the end each chapter. The only 'winning tactic' is to routinely switch between the characters and get a swipe or two in before the boss goes invulnerable (while you watch for 5 seconds of boredom) and then paralyzes you. That means being knocked out for 10 seconds. Switch characters, get paralyzed again before the other guy recovers. You can imagine how lame and stupid this gets. Quickly.

If the controls were nicely tightened (alot of work), animations made smoother and more varied, gameplay deepened to more than an endless chain of wild blind swings, and bosses made challenging and/or FUN... if all of that was fixed, this game would be a decent, albeit short, fantasy hack and slash. If you could sit down and just watch it play itself the way the developers may have envisioned, it could make for an entertaining movie. As it stands, Demon Stone gets bogged down in it's horrible mechanics.

If you can handle the aggrivating cheapness of the game, check a bargain bin. Prepare to be annoyed and be glad the game only lasts a few hours. The underlying story and characters might make the journey worthwhile."
2183,3,"I feel like the grip could be larger, and the triggers aren't perfect, I may be looking elsewhere as I kind of like the top trigger function."
2184,3,Arrived on time and in good shape. My son and daughter enjoy playing it. Will make other purchases for them in the future.
2185,3,Works great as all original Nintendo products do. My issue is with the high price. I guess there aren't any other options because the generic versus often do not work.
2186,3,"World of Warcraft brought back the beautiful simplicity of vanilla and BC combat by reducing the amount of buttons needed to be pressed to be good. However, you still have to grind for gear in PvE, and PvP sucks unless you have other good people to play with, or can handle the gear grind. It's got nice content, but be prepared to wind up grinding in the long run for gear or gold."
2187,3,i like this game.
2188,3,"Cool defense mode, but the DLC is way too expensive, when I got this for about $13 new, and each DLC/Map Pack for the defense mode DLC is $14.99 each and there's 4 of them.  That's just ridiculous, I'd love to throw them some more money, but those prices are ridiculous!"
2189,3,"A good game, a blast from the past // PS2 glory days.  I forgot that the controls are so very wonky, characters are awkward and difficult to manage in normal condition, leave alone surviving a shootout with hungry zombies.  I feel strongly that software ports to modern systems should include options to tweak controls if desired, or keep them as the original game provided.  This happens with ports of many games and it is disappointing, especially given the sophistication of modern game controllers.  Not the game's fault though.  Fair warning."
2190,3,"Excellent campaign, but the multiplayer has all the worst attributes of COD.  First I'll address the campaign.  It's fantastic, especially if you like hard-ish scifi.  The characters are all pretty likable, and there are large awe inspiring set piece moments COD is known for.  The only down side is that the climax and follow through were not perfectly executed, and a main adversary gets taken off the board at an odd time and in a anti-climactic way.  However, for 90% of the campaign the pace is great, the spectacle of warfare is better than ever, and it even manages to have heart!  I recommend renting if nothing else than for a good popcorn flick style campaign.

I will not comment on zombies or MW:Remastered, as I have not played them yet.  Although COD4:MW was excellent when I played it 9 years ago, so I'm sure I'll still love it.  Now we get to the turd in the punchbowl: multiplayer.  Yes, the controls are still good and tight, yes the weapons feel nice and punchy, but I feel like everything I hate about recent COD multiplayer was amplified in the 5 or so hours I've spent with it so far.  Bunny hopping, quick scoping, dolphin diving, it's all here in abundance.  My brother says it ought to be called Annually Released Preteen Distraction, not COD, and perhaps he is correct, as I have liked COD less and less since MW3.  Sure, I'm over 30 now and my reflexes kinda suck, but I still immensely enjoy other shooters like Titanfall, BF1, and Overwatch.

However, I think COD's multiplayer problems are deeper than my lack of twitch shooting ability.  For one the maps suck, not one particularly fun or memorable map in my play time thus far.  Second, there is now pay to play, as you can spend real money for supply drops to unlock weapons/camos, in addition to paying for the inevitable DLC.  Third, I feel that it's gotten too ""twitchy"", personally I think MW3 and BLOPS1 were the sweet spots."
2191,3,"I really want to like this mouse. I own a lot of gaming mice that I have purchased over the past two years. Probably more along the line of a dozen now. The G602 is just a ok mouse for gaming in my collection.

Here's why:
1) Its heavy and has a bigger handprint. To give you an idea, its much more heavier than a Logitech G502 (of which I also own). There is a lot of rubber making this heavier than plastic. The two batteries don't make it any lighter either. I'm not a fan of heavy mice as it creates hand fatigue for me.
2) The scroll wheel isn't anything like the G502. It doesn't spin freely and doesn't click firmly either. It has more of a loose spinning friction feel to it than a locking one.
3) The 6 side buttons are a little too small bezel wise and have a not so smooth edge feel to it. Its not bad, better than the MMO mice I have. However, what I don't like is the position of the buttons farthest to the foot of the mouse. They are way too far back. This causes me to reposition my hand to get to them and really kink my thumb backwards. In fast FPS games, this doesn't work well for me as my entire palm and fingers shift backward.
4) Scroll wheel clicks to the left and right side feel awkward and take too much effort to perform. This, unlike the G502 which is way easier.

What I like about it:
1) Losing the cord is great. I love not having it hit anything on my desk.
2) The rubber feet are very good too and glide easily.
3) The rubber top feels good and gives more grip than mice that use plastic tops at the palm

If Logitech could remove some of the rubber on this mouse and make it more lighter and change the position of the 6 side buttons to be moved farther up toward the front of the mouse by 1/2"", this would be a top 5 on my list. But as it stands, I can't give it that. Its good, but not the best."
2192,3,Sony vita was slim piece of cheap crap and reason why I say it because it is easy to break. I gave up on Sony handhelds. It was alright because it had a awesome library of games but cheaper made. If you want to play vita games get a pstv because it is better. Handheld I recommend Nintendo more.
2193,3,Worked great but shortly after the charge wire stopped working. The  battery doesn't last much more then a day or two. In loved it at first but now only two months in and having problems already I'm thinking they won't last long at all.
2194,3,OK
2195,3,the game was kind of rough and it took a while to load. i cleaned it around the best i could and it finally worked. i got it for a very cheap price but overall it works
2196,3,Probably my least favorite amiibo. Not a bad figure but the quality isn't there unlike others available. Also mostly useless unless you have that one Animal Crossing party game or Mario Maker.
2197,3,Its not that I don't like it because I do and I need them.  The only problem I have is that the two I bought were defective and they freeze.. so I cant enjoy my favorite game until I get new ones
2198,3,Good potential but not delivered. Fun gameplay. Average graphics. Tactical game that was repetitive at the end. In overall just fine for the price.
2199,3,"I had purchased several cheap sticks and wore them out. As such I decided to get something of quality and have heard rave reviews about this stick and its Sanwa parts. The build quality is good, the enclosure has a nice weight to it. It works well on several fighters (MKvDCU, MvC2, SF4) although I think I'm just as good with the regular controller.

That said, the joystick is VERY soft as are the buttons. I had expected more resistance feedback more like a true arcade stick. This sensitivity makes this stick all but useless for old school games like PacMan CE (a real shame!).

I plan on swapping out some parts (8-way gate, new buttons, Eurostyle joystick) but frankly I dropped [...] on something that I now need to ""tweak"" which doesn't impress me. Its a good stick but its hardly the second coming and at this price point I could only justify 3 stars.

UPDATE: I have since upgraded to an 8-way gate, new joystick, and colored buttons (all that took about 10 min and I had never done anything like that before). Overall the performance is a little better but I'm sticking with 3 stars."
2200,3,"It's funny how some games get one thing right then blow the rest out the window.  This game has mastered rain soaked streets.  I have not seen better looking rain soaked streets in a game before.  This is the state of the art in rain soaked streets.
The problem is if your looking for more than some nice looking rain soaked streets then your out of luck.
The car control is nice if not a little arcade like.  This is by no means a simulation of any real world cars.  In fact the game has no real world cars.  The have some that LOOK like a Honda Civic and the like but these are cars only found in the world of video games.
The streets you race on are large and sometimes too large.  When trying to chase down an opponent it can get boring.  The races are boring at times too.  Not a test of race skills per say, more like how well you remember the shortcuts.
The game play is ok.  The graphics are ok. The sound and music are ok. In short this is an OK game.  Nothing to call your friends up and brag about.  More something to be mentioned off hand like ""oh yea.  I got that game at the launch.  It's ok.  Wanna play SSX?"""
2201,3,Feels a bit cheap. It'd be nice if gaming companies and the likes would stop being lazy with their products.
2202,3,"Wonderful games.  Loved all 3.  Good stories, fun gameplay, good characters, beautiful world's, etc.  In this collection , AC Blackflag is the best.  However, AC Rogue is missing from the series.  Rogue is my favorite in the Americas saga.  It ties off the Fenway family story and leads right into the AC Unity story.  Not sure why they would release only 3/4 of the Americas saga in a collection.  They should have waited until Rogue was out to do it right."
2203,3,I have win 10 to play this game you will need to download a crack. because win 10 does not support this game. I used my cd key and i own the game.
2204,3,"Republic Commando is an excelent game. I highly reccomend it to halo fans. Althought the single player campaign is pretty short, there are often multiple ways of completing missions which gives the game very high replayability. I have never grown weary of this game. As good as the single player campaign is, the multiplayer really isn't that great. Despite that, this is a supurb game, and might be near one of my top favorites."
2205,3,"Square Enix's return to the Parasite Eve franchise turns out to be an action-packed PSP title, though perhaps not what every fan was hoping for.

Premise:

It's Christmas Eve, the year is 2012, and citizens are optimistically pacing the snowy, holiday streets of Manhattan when chaos suddenly erupts. Giant tentacle like structures burst from the ground, terrorizing the city as they rise to eventually form twisted spires arching toward the sky. The assault on Manhattan has begun, and Aya Brea returns to face a new foe - the Twisted.

The perspective of the game begins behind that of the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation), whose secret weapon is none other than Aya Brea, a woman with the ability to dive into the souls of other organisms, and with the help of the CTI technology, she can dive into organisms in different time periods as well. Aya in the 3rd Birthday, however, isn't the heroine fans will remember her as. Her memories are clouded as a result of a dramatic incident, and it has left her character much more vulnerable and frail sounding as compared to the previous games. As she battles the Twisted, the monsters that have infested Manhattan, she gradually comes across familiar faces, putting together the mystery of her past and the origins of the Twisted one step at a time.

Eve games have proven to host interesting concepts in their narratives, and the 3rd Birthday is no different in this regard. It's a shame then, that the cutscenes that progress the game's story are largely mediocre, plagued with awkard dialogue and weak interaction between characters. The essence of time travel that involves a good portion of the game isn't spelled out for the player all that well, with a measly date stamp at the beginning of each mission being the only guide post to go by -- so it's fairly easy to forget what time you are in and why it matters  The stilted conversation between characters makes understanding a seemingly complex story quite difficult - and with the ending actually being quite interesting, it's unfortunate the game couldn't carry itself more properly.

Combat:

Unlike its predecessors, the 3rd Birthday is a shooter above anything else, with only a light dose of RPG based elements to fool around with.  However, some creative mechanics make the game much more interesting than a standard shoot-em-up.

Fundamentally the game is fairly fast paced lock on shooter, with the most basic (yet very crucial) dodging and cover mechanics. Beyond that however, the game revolves Aya's ability to dive into the souls of others, called Overdive. In the majority of battles you encounter, you'll be accompanied by a group of U.S. soldiers, and while they do their part in the shooting, they are much more useful as targets to dive into.

You can dive at any time as long as a living ally is in the battlefield, even if you are dying and the game over screen is about to pop up, you can dive into a nearby soldier. As you take the place of your new host, you naturally leave the former behind you. Doing so can get you out of hazardous situations at key moments, give you a better strategic position, put you into someone with more health, and of course, allow you to use whatever weapon your host was carrying - this includes taking control of powerful vehicles such as tanks and helicopters. There may be a feeling of guilt in abusing other people's bodies like this, but reinforcements eventually replace the fallen soldiers should you run out.

Aya also has the ability to dive into enemies and implode them from the inside. This attack does massive damage and is essential in taking out some of the tougher forms of Twisted. To successfully engage in the attack however, you must first pummel the enemy with enough consecutive fire power to bring up the overdive prompt. Fast firing assault rifles or powerful explosives are among the best ways to bring up an overdive opportunity. Probably the best method, and a more respectable use of your teammates, is the Crossfire ability.  Instead of emptying a clip into an enemy by yourself, you can charge up a lock on to a target and once full, order all squad members to focus fire the target to bits - outright killing most weak enemies or quickly creating an opportunity for you to dive into them.

Finally, a super move called ""Liberation"" can be periodically activated after you've battled enough, allowing Aya to rapidly shoot energy from a pair of handguns along with granting her lightning fast movement. It's a very handy tool in getting your head above water in the game's many difficult firefights.

The game really doesn't have a great variety of enemy types, and all though they put on some intense encounters for you to face, the game can feel a bit repetitive when ""new"" enemies are merely re-colored, stronger versions of previous missions. The few types the game has however aren't pushovers though - some enemies have devastating melee attacks, projectiles that must be dodged, some can swallow you whole on the spot, and many have multiple forms that make them hard to penetrate. Amongst making your way through these encounters, you'll be required to destroy enemy spawning points, blast down walls, plant C4, and dodge traps - suffice to say, the game requires your full attention.

While the 3rd Birthday is challenging, it's sometimes frustratingly so because while the enemies demand great use of reflex and overdive use, it's the camera and lock-on feature that are often the biggest obstacles.

Primarily, the camera suffers in the game's many corridor encounters, where you are often up against several powerful creatures and have little way of keeping track of what's behind you. As you frantically try to realign the camera, projectile attacks will abuse you from your blind spots and often times you'll be left guessing blind in terms of what's after you.

The lock-on feature then suffers from battles with many enemies on the field. The game is so fast paced and dodging is so key to survival, that finding your target again amongst a dozen will be more lethal to you than any enemy. There's a nifty hot key to target what's closest to you, but should you be targeting a specific enemy and need to drop your aim to run somewhere, dodge something, or dive somewhere else, well -- good luck finding that target again.

Boss battles are surprisingly fresh feeling, each one asking for different approaches in order to achieve victory, and luckily these do not suffer from any camera or lock on issues when compared to the game's frantic firefights.

RPG Elements:

Despite the focus on intense firefights, the 3rd Birthday is still a light RPG on the side. Killing enemies awards experience points, making Aya stronger with every level, as well as currency that can be used on upgrading existing weapon load outs or buying new ones.

The game features handguns, powerful revolvers, assault rifles, grenade launchers, and other special weapons for you to enjoy. Upgrading guns has some thought put into it, as each features a number of improvable characteristics. Often times, for example, you'll be forced to choose whether you want a weapon to have more Power, or if you prefer Impact instead. Power flatly increases the gun's damage, while Impact makes for quicker overdive kill set ups.

Should you feel underpowered, you are free to revisit any previous mission and rack up more XP and money, and even go for a higher mission ranks or achievements that not only give you more substantial rewards, but may unlock more weapons and extra goodies as well. With a great deal of unlockables including cheat codes, weapons and costumes being left after beating the game, there's reason enough to go and shoot up the story again should you be able to stomach replaying the same missions again.

A more subtle element to the game's customization is the use of OE (Over Engergy) chips, often acquired when diving into enemies. At save points or when back at base, these chips can be placed on a board and give way to useful passive abilities such as boosts to defense, restocking ammo after overdiving, and chances to unleash powerful attacks. Placing chips on the board can raise the level of pre-existing ones, or randomly create new ones. Malignant, or negative chips can appear as well, so some caution is required as you play around with Aya's DNA.

Presentation:

The 3rd Birthday stands amongst the best looking of PSP titles, with cutscenes looking very clean, and character models that look particularly impressive. Enemy designs all fit a well thought up theme, and the term Twisted accurately suits them.  Aya's ""armor"" even takes real time damage as well, and her already torn jeans can be fried almost completely off if you take a hard enough of beating.  Fan service or a strategic game element, it may be appreciated either way.

In-game battle runs smooth which is great given its fast paced nature (save for rare instances of slowdown during massive firefights), and load times are light after a quick data install.

The environments you pass through are often impressive, outdoors in the snowy streets of Manhattan especially, but they quickly become repetitive instances of grey corridors and the grimy, boring habitats of the Twisted. The small barriers for taking cover behind look out of place at times, making certain battlefields feel cheap and superficial.

The soundtrack features some great, melancholic piano pieces that fit the mood of the game well, along with some respectably intense orchestrated music for bigger encounters. Sound effects in general don't push to impress, but the screams of enemies and the sound of the weapons all sound satisfying enough.

Conclusion:

Ultimately, Parasite Eve: The 3rd Birthday rises to impressive heights in its combat, bringing elements that make for a challenging and well layered shooter. There are many issues bringing it down however, including frustrating camera and lock-on controls, repetitive instances of combat, and a poorly executed plot. Plenty of extra content to unlock may be enough reason to dive into this PSP title, but it stands as a crucially flawed, yet creative attempt at reviving the franchise nonetheless.

Narrative and Characters
Aya has reason enough to have a changed, weaker character in the 3rd Birthday, but the other introduced characters prove to have little to no depth, failing to maturely execute a complicated plot that asks for much more than stilted dialogue and weak cutscenes.

Combat
Delightfully creative, demanding, and fast paced, the game's combat features well thought up encounters and shining boss fights throughout.  Enemies are well designed, but a lack of variety eventually saps some enjoyment moving from firefight to firefight.

Control
Camera and lock-on issues significantly hamper much of the game's combat. Keeping track of where enemies are and attempting to lock on to the proper ones end up making the game's controls more lethal than its enemies.

Aesthetics
Pretty cutscenes, a solid audio and a smooth playing game help make for a richer experience. Character models look great but environments quickly become drab and repetitive.

Love it or Hate it:
There's little to love here in terms of characters or plot. If you are new to the franchise you'll have trouble understanding what's going on. If you're a fan, you'll have trouble understanding what's going on and probably be offended in the process. That and the very action focused approach to the game makes the 3rd Birthday a tough recommendation to make to previous fans.

The Experience: 6.9"
2206,3,"I'll tell you what I hated first. You don't have access to all cars in the game. You have to progress deeper and deeper and unlock cars. It doesn't matter if you have 57million bucks in your account, you still cant buy the cars you really want until you progress further. 2nd, I hated the difficulty settings. I would play some races on easy and destroy the competition and then I'd play a different race on easy and get my buttocks whipped seriously. EASY is EASY. It shouldn't matter. 3rd, the races were too long for my attention span. I would be doing fine in a race and then 10 minutes in I would screw up and have to start all over. That pissed me off. Okay, there's some good in here somwhere. The cars look pretty good and sound awesome. When you upgrade your engine the sound changes. The turbo sounds on this game are the best I've heard. You can actually hear the turbo sucking in air, not just the blow-off valve like most games. But all that won't matter if a game isn't fun to play. This game is not exhilarating and you won't be rushing home to play it. Rent this one before you buy it."
2207,3,Fit loose bad for fighting games not an issue when i play gta5
2208,3,Can be difficult to tell when you're getting hit. Somewhat over hyped.
2209,3,"Honest review of Diablo 3.  I have not played any previous Diablo games, so this is new to me.  I own World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2. I enjoy Blizzard games and like the community.

  Diablo 3 is described as an action RPG; I would consider it a water down version of that. I consider an RPG along the lines of WoW and Skyrim.  There are some RPG elements like equipment customization, but not in character builds.  Your stats increase a set amount depending on the character you choose and you unlock specific skills at different levels.  The customization is that you choose what unlocked skills to use at any particular time. I have always enjoyed choosing what skill I wanted when I leveled up, I am not use to having it chosen for me. I understand why Blizzard did this, they wanted to make it easier to play and encourage new players.  However, what attracted me to buying Diablo in the first place was the customization that I read about for Diablo 2.  For me, customization and character builds comes before story in RPGs.  Even though this is disappointing the game is still enjoyable.  The random loot gives a good amount of customization, but leveling does not have the same satisfaction I am accustomed to.  The story is quite enjoyable and the cut scenes are fun to watch, they are timed to not  interfere with the gameplay.  I find the voice acting superb.

  The game play mechanics are easy to learn and use. The challenge comes in the timing and loads. Basically, you can assign abilities you have unlocked to both mouse buttons and numerical keys 1-4. I have heard complaints about this namely that players want access to all abilities and not limited to just six.  However, I find this adds to the challenge because you have to choose the right load out for the situation. It is easy to change and the cool down time is very short.

  Replay value of the game is there for at least a couple of play throughs with different characters, but may become boring after that.  Yes, loot drops are random and yes, some aspects of the dungeons are random as well, but if you are not into loot hunting and auction house whoring-the game could lose its appeal. Even with multiplayer players who are not trying to find the next great piece of equipment may get bored after a few play throughs.  At this point, I am not bored and playing with my second character. I am interested to see if there is money making opportunity with the ""real money"" auction house when it is up and running.  I think the lack of player controlled leveling customization may hurt long-term replay value though.

  I chose to give the game three stars for two reasons.  First, I marked off a star because of the watered down customization, this is a huge issue for me, but may not apply to everyone. I just feel long-term replay value may be hurt by this and past Diablo games have been known for replay value.

  I marked off a second star for the fact that you must have an internet connection to play single player.  This really does not affect me because I am always connected, but I believe players should have a choice. Battlenet is a double edge sword in my opinion. I like that I can login to any computer and easily download a game I already payed for and play anywhere. Currently I have WoW, Starcraft 2 and Diablo on numerous computers. I like the fact all I have to do is enter my account info and I am off. However, on the other side there is no resale value. I hardly sell games, but I believe it is a player's choice. You buy a car, house, gun, stereo, etc, you can choose to sell. I think games should be the same. Even though it does not really apply to me I stand by the community and thus, marked off a star."
2210,3,"Yes, this game has been bashed to death by the gaming press, but believe it or not, some people will actually enjoy this bargain-priced game IF they give it a chance and cast away all the negative comments made by the press.
What we have here is a 2D fighter on the XBOX with some remarkable realistic graphics and movements.  The animation and movements of the fighters is almost lifelike, and the power of the XBOX is utilized in ways to make fabric move convincingly and so on.  It's amazing that 2D fight fans will salivate over a new 16-bit Neo Geo fighter (beleive it or not, they are still releasing games for that system!) yet will completely overlook Kabuki Warriors.  The backgrounds are nice too with some clean 3D polygonal effects thrown in for good measure.  Any problems so far?  Yes.  There seems to be too many variations of just one character and you won't see any of the more spectacular ones until later in the game.  The default character that you'll see more often than not is just a boring guy painted in a shade of white who fights with chinese stick weapons.  Also, the backgrounds are kinda boring...but this is intended as Kabuki is a type of stage art very popular in Japan.
The game consists of a tour mode and a time attck mode.  The tour mode is cool in that you need to earn money to progress to the goal.  You earn money by quick, clean victories and for posing and winning the crowd during the fight.  After a fight you can trade one fighter to get the best mix of weapon and styles for the fight ahead.  The game really picks up when you get some of the characters who fight with the various swords...some insane fun can be had with the usual combos and air juggles you can pull off with these guys!
How does it play?  Imagine Killer Instinct-style gameplay where moves and combos can be strung together with simple button presses.  Persevere and learn the combo system and you have yourself a competent fighting game.  If you just mash the buttons and jump around hoping for random victories, then you'll get less out of this game.
The bottomline:  If you enjoy 2D fighting games and you like learning the combo and timing system, then this is definitely a reasonably priced game for you.  If you prefer your fighters in 3D, hate fighters or are one of those people who just mash buttons and ""hope for the best"", then forget it.  Get Dead Or ALive 3 instead."
2211,3,more of the same old crap the only way to play  without cheaters is to play the missions with other players other wise way to many booster and cheater and hackers as always and what good is the report tab if they do nothing about it.
2212,3,"New content is good but not as substantial as the Taken King.
Played so far and its redone fallen with random death spawned orbs that come at you like taken Hoblins.
Add to that the majority (if not all) are working on Destiny 2.
Once that is released it will be the death on Destiny 1. Especially when devs are hampered by an engine made to allow last gen consoles to participate."
2213,3,"This an alright Keyboard for games but I would not recommend it for that because the g keys are placed by often used keys like; shift, ctrl, alt, and esc, so as a result since they are rarely used the keys should have been placed below the windows key, something this obvious should have not been overlooked I expect more from corsair."
2214,3,"My 6 year old daughter was so excited to get this game.  She had lots of fun playing it for the hour it took her to collect all the pets.  She got through the game that fast.  I let her take it to the local game store and trade it in.  Glad we only paid $6.99 for it, but it should be less for what you're really getting."
2215,3,"Right off the bat, the gun controller seems designed for children, which is kind of odd, given the game's rating.

While the gun incorporates a pulse monitor, the execution isn't very refined. In fact, it's sort of cheesy. And though the gameplay is probably fun for avid hunters, for casual game players, it's tedious and repetitive.

It'd make a good gift for the hunter who has everything, I guess. But I can't see many other people seeing much value in it."
2216,3,"The second Gundam game to ever come to the US. Only this time, this one came to the PlayStation and it's about time ! The game appears to be a 2D fighter (it is actually a renamed version of one of the Gundam Battle Master series from Japan). This game, like any other anime-based games, is strictly for fans of the original Gundam anime series. In this game, you get to play as all kinds of mobile suits from the Universal Century Gundam series and After Colony Gundam series. The only Gundam Wing mobile suit is the Wing Gundam. Speaking of that, in Story Mode, you will play as Gundam Wing's popular main character, Heero Yuy. But don't feel discouraged about playing as the Wing Gundam throughout the whole game. You get to select different Mobile Suits like Zeon mobile suits, Earth Federation Gundams, and Gundams from the After Colony series. Your mission is to find the man responsible for starting all these meaningless wars between two centuries. During his journey, he will encounter some familiar characters from the Gundam universe like Kamiru Bidan from Z-Gundam, Char Aznable from Mobile Suit Gundam, Trieze Kushrenada from Gundam Wing, and more. Anyway, let me describe the game's bad side and good side altogether. The graphics are okay. The animation is smooth but the mobile suits look totally bad with all those pixels on the edges. Still, the Mobile Suits move smoothly as if they are featured in a 3D fighter. The backgrounds look great. They totally resemble the battle arenas of all of the Gundam series. The controls are so-so, to those who never mastered (or never bothered to master) Dragonball GT Final Bout for the PlayStation. To many of you, its very slow and very impossible to beat up your opponent with just a two-hit combo. But to me, its just plain fun to master ! But still, I was pretty much expecting the cool gameplay mechanics from Super Famicom's only Gundam Wing title on Japan, Gundam Wing: Endless Duel, but this is more than enough. It's all about mastering and understanding the game very well. The music is too forgetable and horrible. It doesn't necessarily match the action. Only a few tracks are cool, but most of them (stink). On the bright side, the sound effects really resemble that of the Gundam series like the movements of the Mobile Suits and weapon usage like the beam saber slash, rifle beam firing, and the sound of brutally scratched metal. The most annoying sound is the voice announcer. Gosh ! Will someone turn off the voice ! Maybe Bandai should've had a much better announcer. That guy can't even pronounce the names of the Gundams correctly. And when the announcer sets up the fight, he sounds like he's on drugs or something. For pete sake, this is a fight mister, not a childrens storybook ! Even if Gundam Battle Assault suffers a mouthful of flaws, its still worth the purchase if you happen to be a fan of the Gundam series. This may never earn its right to be the best 2D fighter ever, but its very fun to play ! To the Gundam fans out there, go get this game ! You'll definently have a blast with this one ! If you want to play other Gundam games for the US, play Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes for the Dreamcast or play Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaubro for the PlayStation 2 game console. The thing that (stinks) is that Gundam Battle Assault is a rare game now, and they barely sell it that much. But if you're lucky and you found it, buy it right now, before someone else gets their hands on it !"
2217,3,"I received the game, everything was in great conditions and the delivery was really good, but i did not received the greatest hits edition, i received the regular one, so the product selling in the picture is quite wrong, this is pretty annoying, since i usually sell my games after finished, but the regular edition is cheaper than the greatest hits edition!! If you are considering this item, maybe would like to try for the collection edition with inFamous I & II... ."
2218,3,Alright
2219,3,"Out of the Gamecube controllers I have this is the one I like the least, the buttons feel a bit off, but thats just me. I have a friend who is a really good at smash who doesn't mind it at all. My main issue with the controller is the cable is too short but even thats is not too bad."
2220,3,"It's not quite following the original story of the Transformers but for diehard fans it should be fun.

The Decepticons and Autobots are still fighting but this time they decide to bring in robots called Minicons to sizzle the story. In reality they don't provide that much entertaining but the rest of the game is good. As the Autobots you travel all over the world and you get to transform into the vehicle of your choosing.

On the downside you really don't get many characters to pick from but they did provide a lot of the more popular characters like Optimus Prime and Rodimus. Atari could have made this better allowing gamers to choose more character and maybe playing as the Decepticons themselves.

The graphics are good much of what you expect the characters do look semi-close to their real counterparts. The music was passable. The one thing they did do a nice job off is providing voices for the Autobots and Decepticons. They aren't the voices from the old series but the new one. Ah well it was still kind of them to do that.

The controls were a mixed bag. On some levels it became more clear than others that perhaps they should have added more  You initially just have a gun but when you collect the minicons you're able to add more to your inventory. This I found annoying because well the Autobots have a ton of weapons of their own and this sort of took part of the mystique away.

This explains why this game got mixed reviews. On one hand, it's a Transformers game, on the other hand they only got half of the game right.

The game itself with the bosses will hold your attention span for the end. While the early bots are fairly easy to get through, the game gets tough as you go through it.

One thing that does save the game from being a total dud is the amount of extras that they threw in. You get tv spots, Transformers comic art, and other revealing footage about the game.

The game ain't too shabby. It could have been much better but as I say if you're a diehard fan you'll want to play it."
2221,3,"There is a good story line on this game.  However, you could play the whole game and skip the cinematic scenes.  They don't really tell you anything relevant that trial and error won't do for you while playing.  I would buy it again.  You probably won't play it again after beating New York Minute accept for the special finale.  If you liked the rescue of Morpheus, then you will like this game, 100."
2222,3,I don't play it that much. I guess because I'm a assassin's creed guy (smile)
2223,3,cant really rate it... mine was defective. what I could see of the graphics were excellent...
2224,3,"decent game, not great. But ok."
2225,3,"I liked every part of the game accept for the last boss, I didn't like pressing the dance buttons on the last part, because if you mess up you lose a life, and they put too many buttons to press, I have already finished the game."
2226,3,Cute game with cute noises not a bad game but not a favorite.
2227,3,"Liked that it had more games than expected or have heard of back in the old arcade days.  The not so great part is that older games require much more patience with the controls, especially with games you've never played before.  The controls on the games I was familiar with seem a little clunky with modern controllers."
2228,3,"This is a decent game -- not great, but ok. 3 stars.  Here's why:  First of all, some of the screens are pretty dark.  I know they do this so you'll use the thermal imaging and x-ray vision (both pretty cool), but it takes away from the gameplay, in my opinion, when you can't see the whole screen.  Secondly, I'm using my Sureshot Rifle, so take this in stride, but pushing the C and Z buttons is a little cumbersome, but not too terrible.  I'm going to try this with the WiiZapper, and if it's a lot better, I'll post that on here.  I really think it will be about the same...  The power-up special weapons are a little difficult to use, too.  By comparison, they're much easier to use on my Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011 or Remington Grand Slam North America (two excellent games) than this game, but still usable.  It was pretty fun game what I've played so far, but didn't put me on the edge of my seat like the 2 games I mentioned above.  It's an ok buy, tho, for $20."
2229,3,"One of the last ""classic"" Need For Speed games (Pre-Autolog) and at least as good as Underground but a bit too Hollywood.  It tried to cash in on the ""Fast and Furious"" craze and did a pale imitation of the storyline.  I don't need a Call of Duty story just to race around a moonlit city to enjoy a Need For Speed title."
2230,3,"it just couldn't hold my attention. I guess I still hold all 1st person shooters to the Half Life 2 standard.

The graphics are good, but not great. Certain things look good from a distance, but not up close-even with the anti-aliasing turned all they way up. The sound is o.k. The gameplay is somewhere in between good, and o.k. There just wasn't enough about the game to make me keep playing. Luckily I bought the game used.

The only gripe I have is that I cannot access the special features on the DVD. Vivendi customer service was no help, so I just gave up. It is nice having the game on one disk, but I would like to get EVERYTHING I paid for.

All in all the game was o.k., but not ground-breaking like it has been described as."
2231,3,"I bought this for $100 on one of the Black Friday deals.  I've already got a PS3 and love it.  For the price, I thought it would be great to have both systems.  I'm not quite as thrilled with the Xbox so far.  I've got Windows 8 on my PC and I don't mind it, but the Xbox interface is very similar and I really hate it.  So if you don't like Windows 8, you're probably not going to like this either.  Plus you can't do much with the Xbox unless you pay for an Xbox live membership.  Forget about watching Netflix.  You'll have to shell out money for the yearly membership if you want to use the app.  That's just ridiculous.  I already pay for Netflix and my internet connection.  Why does Microsoft need a cut?  I've never been one to bash Microsoft, but the Xbox has changed my mind.  I enjoy playing online with my PS3, but I'm a casual gamer and don't play that often.  It's not worth it to pay an extra fee just to have the option available.  I'm giving this three stars because I bought the Kinect at the same time, and my 8 year old son likes it.  For me, I regret purchasing this."
2232,3,"Forgotten Places - Lost Circus is a pretty good seek and find game boasting several distinctive mini-puzzles along the way.  Casual hidden object gamers should enjoy the gameplay quite a bit, as the puzzles themselves aren't particularly difficult, the game is quite forgiving of wrong clicks, and hints are usually readily available.  Those seeking a real challenge will zip through the entire game rather quickly, though, as it does feel comparatively short for a game in this genre.

I have no complaints about the visuals, as this is a rather beautifully rendered adventure.  The storyline itself, though, seems rather silly to me.  Most of us don't play these games for the storyline, but that doesn't mean we don't appreciate a good one when we find one - this one, unfortunately, doesn't really make the grade.  While the originality of some of the min-games helps offset this weakness to some degree, it's not enough to win me over completely.  In the end, I just can't get overly excited about this title, especially given the fact that the game can easily be played in one sitting and is slightly easier than the average game of this type."
2233,3,Story was pretty good.  Graphics are good.  Combat feels clunky sometimes.  And the open world is just too big.  This game just wasn't for me.
2234,3,"At first ""Mystery P.I. Portrait of a Thief"" was a very addicting game but, after several chapters, it became mind-numbingly repetitive and the whole mystery solving theme got lost. The storyline is that you are a detective who is trying to solve the case of paintings missing from a gallery. You need to gather evidence by finding objects in various locations in the town. You progress through 20 chapters in the case. After finding all the required objects in a chapter, you solve a puzzle. These puzzles can be either piecing a jigsaw puzzle together, completing a word search, matching pictures that complement each other, or putting tiles together to form a picture. Once the puzzle is complete, you are given new information about the case which begins a new chapter with more items to find and a puzzle at the end and so on.

The locations were diverse and interesting and some of the items were very well hidden. The locations were easy to see for the most part; however, I noticed in airports the lighting made the game very dark and almost impossible to play. For added challenge, sometimes descriptions were not what they seemed. An ""eye,"" for example, could be an Egyptian-style drawing of a eye, the word ""eye"" or simply an eye. If the list included more than one ""bat"" that could mean a flying bat and a baseball bat. The music was rather pleasant, but also repetitive and could get stuck in your head.

As repetitive as the music was, so was the game play. After finishing several chapters, the same locations kept coming up and the game became tiring seek and find. Unlike ""Chronicles of Mystery: Curse of the Ancient Temple,"" for example, I never felt like the game was a mystery.  ""Chronicles"" is a seek and find game with puzzles as well but there is interaction with the locations that gives a sense of detective work.  ""Mystery P.I."" did not offer such interaction.  The search areas and puzzles were independent of the storyline.  There was absolutely no crime-solving thought involved. The investigation just progressed as I completed the chapters.

The re-playability of the game is low, in my opinion, because I got so sick of seeing the same places and looking for the same things. Some of the descriptions used are strange, too. A ""bumbershoot"" is an umbrella, for example. I guess the game taught me something. In conclusion, toward the end, I tried to finish the chapters as quickly as possible and was disappointed when a new chapter started as I just wanted to finish the game and move on to something else. That is never a good sign."
2235,3,"Ya this game is ass. I thought it was gona be amazing and have great game play and some kick ass guns. I was wrong the trailers looked amazing because they showed the only good parts of the game. I jus rented this game (THANK GOD) but it is hardly worth the 8$. I couldn't beliv how lame the game play is and how it tries to be a stealthy game when its just a regular old fps with nothing new to offer. The graphics are AMAZING and the maine chick is hot , but that is abou it nothing else to this game but runing and guning. My opinion just rent the game or wait til its a greatest hit."
2236,3,"Resident Evil(orignal/playstation 1): This iconic game brought Survival Horror Genre to the home consoles and made the genre known to the masses for better and for worse(Resident Evil actually inspired the name of the genre before it had no name). This highly memorable game with its cheesy dialogue and memorable puzzles (moonlight sonata anyone?) was a first for nearly everyone who played it.  Worth playing to this very day but if your not a fan of playstation 1 graphics (they are dated) may wish to grab ps3 or other updated version which are also well liked.

Resident Evil 2:The highlight of the entire survival horror genre in many people's opinions.  Bringing the genre to it's peak with it's entertaining story and game play, game makers must of started to feel pressure to change up the formula rather trying to top this gaming masterpeiece. Yea some might laugh at me calling this a masterpeice but to those people i say it is a masterpeice of cheesy lines and entertaining gameplay and story with cheap thrills and scares along the way.

Resident Evil 3: This one is seen in two very opposing lights.  On one side some people think of this as the best resident evil game it had the most thrills and chills something around every corner however this is clearly where resident evil started to turn away from it's genre
this is the start resident evil turning into a action oriented game. In the view of some people leading to the downfall of the series a few years down the road to others a rebirth. To me personally it's a little of both.  It's a good game nonetheless i enjoyed the mini game at the end more than the actually story mode.

Code Veronica: This was a good game what makes or breaks this game for fans who already played the previous entries is the story.  Many found this game to be the pinnacle of Survival Horror with it the game makers balancing the gameplay better than they did in RE3 as well as improving the graphics backgrounds now rendered in full 3d. I personally didn't like the story so overall i found it to be an underwhelming game but gameplay wise it was certainly was top notch with well balanced gameplay.  Developers consider this to be a direct sequel to RE2.

Resident Evil Zero: Zero is a good game but one plagued with problems from having to backtrack far to often to tedius item swapping to boring puzzles but some of us still forgive it because it's unique and classic style RE and for giving us some background story for the orignal RE.

Resident Evil Outbreak & File #2: An average RE game with the ability to play with 3 other people online so really it was just an RE Social Experiment but a decent game nonetheless and you can play it single player if you wish to.

Resident Evil 4: Made a full transition from survival horror to an plain ole action game barely maintaining any Horror elements at all and attempting to hold onto it's survival elements and enhance them.  Opinions vary wildly on this one
personally RE2 and 4 are my absolute favorites even so RE4 isn't really survival horror it's a great game nonetheless but you can see why long time fans would be dissapointed they expected surviaval horror and they didn't get it.

Resident Evil 5: To some the last great resident evil game to others the series end of relevance...  Tries to up the Survival elements even more swarming you with seemingly endless enemies forcing you to learn your enviroments and know when to run and when to fight which completly changes the gameplay and has little to nothing in common with the rest of the franchise.  This games highlight by most accounts is the multiplayer you can play 2 player story mode.  This in my opinion is RE dumbed down for the masses to enjoy if you can... mindless fun killing of the ""undead"". Fun for what it is i suppose.

Resident Evil Mercenaries 3D/VS:  3d is basically the Mercenaries Mode from RE4 updated and with new scenarios and characters from RE5.  It's fun especially if your a huge fan of RE4 but i wouldn't call it essential by any means.  Game recieved mixed reviews basically if you want more RE4 get it if not forget it.  Vs most would agree just forget it but if you have an iphone or ipad and you love RE4 and wish it had multiplayer online VS mode then hey give it a shot maybe you be one of the few who enjoy it.

Resident Evil 6: Resident evil 6 tries to reinvent resident evil again an obvious attempt to renew the franchise however it fails in most fans opinions.  The game takes a more cinematic approach the graphics are seriously impressive but where it suffers is gameplay the gameplay isn't as fun as in previously installments in most people's opinions and the game reviews reflect that with lower scores.  An above average game but RE fans will be potentially turned off by the fact that this game doesn't resemble RE's past games at all. Also has co-op campaign.

Revelations:  Capcom's response to the negative feedback RE6 got.  Revelations attempts to take the best of elements of classic RE and combine them with new RE.  An episodic adventure that regains alot of the feeling of RE series.  This brings the series back nearly as good as classics RE1 - Code Veronica as close we can hope for in this day and age.  No co-op campaign this time around but a multiplayer raid mode instead.

Revelations 2:Different Story line same idea as revelations but this time they brought co-op campaign mode back but only in split screen (no online).  Raid Mode is online only so guess you and your friend better like this mode if multiplayer is your thing.
This game is nearly as good as the first and some of its extras are superior to the first one.

Footnote Resident Evil Gun/Survivor Spin Offs:  The Umbrella Chronicles & The Darkside Chronicles were both solid rail shooter games that re-tells parts of resident evil story line solid entertainment and a must have if your a fan of both rail shooters and RE if not check out if your interested.  The Survivor Games are a crapfest if you check them out you have been warned best for die hards who like the amusement of really bad games.

SUMMARY: If you never played Resident Evil 2 and can look past the dated graphics get it asap. If you can't look past the dated graphics wait for the remake or grab Code Veronica Instead.  If you like Action Shooter type games Get Resident Evil 4 asap its been re-released on PS4 and most other home consoles.  If you want multiplayer consider RE5 for its co-op campaign or Revelations 2.  If you just want a game closer to the feeling of classic RE with multiplayer options Revlations or Revelations 2 are good options.  If you ever thought what would happen if they made RE almost B movie like ... try RE6 lol"
2237,3,"It's fun but not the best game I like the gta, toon reader games and this does not come close but it is entertaining"
2238,3,This game DOES require activation and an email.  So don't buy a used RFG game unless you have the email that originally activated the game!!!
2239,3,"When I first started playing this game I really liked it. After getting into it I repeatedly find myself disappointed. There are glitches everywhere. I cannot complete 4 or 5 missions without something to prevent my progress. The game has frozen up several times, enemy hvt's that you're supposed to transport back to base get lost in the backdrop. One even got stuck in the air way out of reach. I've become so frustrated with restarting missions I've given up on this game. I wouldnt recommend buying this game."
2240,3,On son's Christmas list and don't know if it works or not but is new and will know after the first of 2016.
2241,3,"I have now played through most of the game for the first time, and I am ready to share my review.  The first thing you want to know - Is it a good game?  Compared to most games, yes.  It has the Bioware storytelling that brings me back time and time again.

They also made some serious improvements to the game.  While I was initially disappointed that I couldn't armor up my companions, I soon learned about the special companion armor I could give them.  It does simplify things a bit when you're not lugging around tons of equipment that you plan to outfit your companions with.  I also appreciate the simplification of enchanting and potion-making.  I love the idea of finding resources and later being able to use them.  I cannot tell you how often in Oblivion I would have a pack full of crafting resources and felt like I spent most of the game trying to manage inventory.  Thanks, Bioware, for simplifying the parts of the game that didn't add to the story.

The skill trees are also improved, and easier to use.

I really like some of the new companions and it feels like you get to play with them more often - as there are many chances to change parties.  Fenris was an instant favorite with me and I also like Merrill, the blood mage. Their stories are compelling and they are interesting characters.

Now, anyone who has played Dragon Age Origins is going to have a visceral reaction.  It is a different game, with a darker, harsher artwork style.  The character is someone new - and you don't feel as much like you are building your character as you did in Origins.  He or she already has a certain life and personality.  I believe this was intentional, similar to Mass Effect's Shephard.  There is definitely a sense of loss that you are not the Hero of Ferelden, but have to form a new relationship.  Still, it's a good thing - the Hero of Ferelden was supposed to live happily ever after, right?  And Bioware does throw in some of the last game's characters - Anders, Alistair and Leilani make an appearance, as does the elf assassin and the sexy duelist.

I have two HUGE complaints with this game.  Huge. Unfortunately you see them enough that they really mar the experience of the game. The re-use of areas was a big mistake.  I know all the dungeons by heart and the maps do not match the dungeon as they use the same maps over and over, but close off doors so that you can't go down certain areas.  The areas are also rather small, you never worry that you'll be lost in a dungeon and miss something!  The advantage is that it's easy to leave, but that's not much of an advantage.  I mean, I remember the Deep Roads in DAI - you really felt like you could get lost in there and never be found.  It felt like true discovery.  As I entered the Deep Roads in DAII, I thought perhaps it would be the same feeling, but it was small, not very detailed, and I never got that joy of discovery or feeling of seeing something new.  I was incredibly disappointed by that.  For the rest of the game, it was just repeat after repeat - same dungeon, same map, same scenery, fights happening in the same area.  One cave is just like another.

The second problem is that it's not grand, it's not epic.  It's a very small, tight story and you lose that epic feel. The story isn't bad, per se, but it takes a long time to get going - and even then, you're not saving the world - you're a player in a city's dramas, and a player only.  I think that this could have been a good thing, a real change from the norm for these games, BUT combined with the small scale of the world and re-use of areas?  Not good.

Also, my final point, if you have a downloadable character that people pay serious Microsoft Points for, it shouldn't be bugged. Every other time I adjust the inventory for Sebastion Vael, it crashes the whole game.  Not cool.  To the point where I never use Sebastien because I never know when I'm going to lose my game.

I hope that Bioware will take the feedback on this game and build Dragon Age III, utilizing the improvements in Dragon Age II, but correcting the issues. I am still a Bioware fan and will probably end up buying their next game, but I'm really hoping that they work with their strengths, roleplaying games, and remember what appeals to people who likes those games."
2242,3,"I bought this for nostalgia, I also really wanted to play it but I found it to difficult. Maybe I'm too old for video games or I'm just really bad at them."
2243,3,"Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a straight forward action/shooter with the storyline serving as a prequel to the first Terminator film.  During the course of the game's 10 missions, you'll play as three different characters (including Kyle Reese, Michael Biehn's character from the original film), and even though the characters look different, the gameplay stays the same.  To move the game along are some nicely rendered CG cinema sequences and in-game cut scenes, plus a comlink to pick up more objectives in the middle of a mission; all of which are nice little additions, but what hurts Terminator: Dawn of Fate are the overly clunky controls and annoying camera.  Especially the fact that depending on which way your character is running, shooting, etc., the controls will change up whenever the camera angle does the same; if all of this would have been corrected this game would be a near must own.  The game's graphics have moments of brilliance, but are nothing special really, as is the sound effects.  All in all, despite it's flaws, Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a must play for fans of the Terminator films, but action gamers may be better suited to look elsewhere."
2244,3,I played it for a few weeks and got bored pretty quickly. It just became stale for me. I love the graphics but there's something I can't put my finger on. I started playing other games that are more colorful and more fantasy based and it seems to keep me entertained more.
2245,3,"I wanted this to extract the game saves from my old GBC games and put them onto my emulator on my computer, and it worked! You'll need a separate GBC cartridge that supports micro USB to put it on your computer. But I never got the cheats to work with it and it's not even in English... I had to translate what the text said when I turned it on."
2246,3,"Not a bad game, just seems a bit hectic all the time, can be hard to figure out who is where and doing what.

That being said, its very forgiving in not penalizing for dying, and i generally enjoy it when playing with my 8 year old daughter."
2247,3,"The game required you to go online once - just a short time - nothing like STEAM.

I experienced some audio stuttering during cut scenes.  I downloaded a patch but my antivirus program said it was malicious so I didn't install it.

The open world feel was great.  It was fun to snatch a vehicle and drive around.  Motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, helicopters, etc.

The interactive environment was fun.  You could blow up buildings, flatten shacks with a tank, cut down trees with a heavy machine gun, etc.

The ability to be ""in disguise"" was a great idea, although it was limited to certain vehicles.

I got hung up on one mission - a timed race.  After maybe 30 tries I just gave up.  Games should always have an ""out"" that would allow you to fail and still continue.  In this case you had to test out an experimental vehicle (and succeed in the allotted time) in order to have the mechanic join your team.  It would have been very simple to just allow the player to pay a big bonus to the mechanic to get them to join you in the event that you failed the mission. (100k, 250k, whatever)

For me the biggest negative was the frequent crashes.  Combined with the limited saves, that made me give up on the game.  I was doing a 3 part mission (destroy 3 separate buildings).  I destroyed 2 and was working on the 3rd when the game crashed.  When I brought it back up the artillery strikes I had used to destroy the 2 buildings were ""gone"" but the 3 buildings were all now standing!  That was so frustrating that I quit.  Sometime I might lower the settings and try it again.

Overall it is a game that has great potential but problems bring it down to an average game for me.  The basic theme of the game would have been great if it had been developed as a role playing game instead of a shooter."
2248,3,good
2249,3,"As a big fan of Far Cry, I was really, really disappointed in Crysis.

The dialog is infantile, the AI is not especially smart, the minimal requirements for the PC are rather high, the story flow is poor, multi-monitor support is non-existant.

Point blank face shots do not result in a kill, and the suit is a stupid comic-book distraction.

The graphics and physics engines are great, but all other elements were put together by wannabe game designers.... and the end result is a very very ""whatever"" game that is so 2005.

Wish I had better news on this... please don't shoot the messenger."
2250,3,"I didn't love it, but I still would buy it again. There is a lot of reading involved."
2251,3,"I never got this game to work, it would not allow me to play. I was overseas and could not authenticate online (combat zone without internet access at the time).

This review is YEARS past due, so I graded it three stars.  The game was never played because of the problems above, but it arrived intact and new. I am sure it would have worked, but the lack of listing the internet requirement killed it."
2252,3,"Maybe that is my problem, I purchased this game with high expectations.  I am a very big fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon, both RCT 1, 2 and both expansions, but Zoo Tycoon is not a fun.  First of all the staff members have less control.  Your maintenance people (they are the ones in charge of making your park look nice), tend to have a mind of their own.  Some of the animals are impossible to please.  I will add that the game is more challenging.  Roller Coaster Tycoon is all about the guests.  You're job is to make you park work nice, and if you do things correctly the roller coasters don't complain about not having enough to eat or that they need more work done on them, or they are feeling crowded by too many guests.  The animals however are easily upset, difficult to take care of and it's very easy to forget about your guests and worry only about your animals.  That makes the game a little more interactive, you have to work extremely hard to make sure you're zoo is productive, the staff and zookeepers are also more expensive.  You have to worry about the animals reproducing, (don't worry mom and dad there are no graphics for that the babies just appear), lest the animals grow to large for their enclosure.  In my opinion that is what makes the game more fun than it's sister, Roller Coaster Tycoon.
One of the big downsides (at least in my opinion) is that their is no winning.  In Roller Coaster Tycoon you have objectives and each scenario is different or more difficult.  In Zoo you pick your own level of difficulty, but there is no way to really win.  I am very competitive and for me there has to be closure.  I currently have a zoo that has been open for ten years, it's completely developed and I have over a million dollars, I started with only 10k, what else do I need to do to win?  Needless to say I have lost intrest in that park and only bring it up and use it when I am bored.
There is a fairly good sized variety of animals and you never run out, it's fun to make your guests happy and make money, you also get to see the private donations that your exhibit attracts and that is quite fun as well.  Overall I am glad that I own it, but I most definatley will not be buying the expansion packs.  It's a fun family game that really can capture you for 2-3 hours and it's seems like you just started to play.  Overall fun game
3 Stars"
2253,3,"Does not charge while the 3DS is opened in use. Other than that, it does it's job."
2254,3,"The atmosphere of 'Dante's Inferno' is truly stunning.  Far too many PS3 games have mediocre graphics but that certainly can not be said about this game. The attention to detail is just amazing.  A rich, saturated color palette, fine texture patterns and the amazing attention to detail is impressive. For the voice work, all of the characters do a good job but the script can be cheesy and the comments often seem misdirected.  Dante is the least likable character by far.  The sound effects throughout the game and most notably during battle are quite good. The music is also spot on.
For the overall look, sound and atmosphere, this game succeeds.

The game progresses as Dante works his way down through the different circles of Hell, each filled with grotesque, twisted souls and various creatures that usually drop in from out of nowhere to attack you.  Dante is armed with a rather wicked scythe that was wrestled from Death himself.  As for weaponry, it's nice to see something other than the old run-of-the-mill sword.  The game presents choices during gameplay...such as absolving or punishing a soul.  This allows you to level up as you collect experience and you have lots of choices as you progress. Your player can be balanced or lean more toward one side or the other depending on the choices you make.  This has a direct impact on your magic and weapon abilities however, some upgrades appear to be more gimicky than useful.

The controls of the game are tight and intuitive.  The only complaint is while fighting, Dante seems to lunge around a lot.  I fell off quite a few cliffs during the course of battle.  Other than that, the controls were very responsive and moves and combos were easy to learn and master.  I enjoyed the ability to conquer and control the large creatures.  It was kind of like being Godzilla for a few minutes but the cumbersome, bulky creatures move very slowly and I sometimes found myself growing impatient especially when traveling longer distances.  Initially, there is a wide variety of demons/creatures though once you hit about the half way point, the creatures are the same, you'll just get more of them in a different combination. There are several difficulty levels but normal seems more like easy and once you determine how to most efficiently dispatch an enemy, you can zip right through most battles and challenges.  Playing a higher difficulty adds slightly to the play time only by making each creature require more hits before dying. Still, few battles pose much challenge and most times I was killed was due to a mistimed/mispositioned jump and not during the heat of battle.  The same is true for boss battles.

The game is extremely linear. There are very few places to search or secret items to find as most are laid out directly in front of you. Even the puzzles are very straight-forward and often simplistic. It's quite clear what you are supposed to do so those looking for more challenging puzzles should look toward other games such as 'Darksiders'.  The game is also very short and can be completed in 10-12 hours.  Replay value is minimal.

The story...well, it's certainly an interesting and unique approach.  Fighting your way through the depths of hell...I mean come on, talk about potential.  The problem is that you whip through each section so quickly that you often don't realize you've completed it til you see old Virgil glowing in front of you.  There is all of this build up as you approach a new level and then after one or two small battles and a few minor obstacles to overcome, that's it, you're done!

Overall, its a good game but kind of a let down.  I would rent instead of buy."
2255,3,"The game itself isn't bad. It's not the best of the Pro Skater series, but I have enjoyed myself playing it. The big problem with it is that it's broken. It really does seem like an unfinished game was released and it's a damn shame. It's heart breaking because Tony Hawk is one of the greatest franchises of the 90s babies generation. I grew up on this franchise and it gave me a great child hood experience. To see an unfinished version of this game rushed to release date pisses me off. I will say this, all the negative reviews have come from the fact that the glitches are soo terrible, it ruins the flow and experience of the game. Activision acknowledged that they are working on a patch to fix some things and I feel like critics should at least wait on that before labeling the game as worse of the decade. Now once it's fixed I do believe it'll increase the experience but it still will be the least impressive of the series. Another big factor to this is ROBOMODO no disrespect but they can't touch Neversofts jockstrap when it comes to making a Tony Hawk game. Sorry to say but Activision should can ROBOMODO if any future Birdman games are released.  Please do not let ROBOMODO do any more damage to the franchise then they've already done. A shame that Neversoft got defunct =((( The Neversoft eye is just as iconic as the Tony Hawk franchise"
2256,3,"...buys you an arcade port of a three level shooter.  Yes, I was one of the people with high hopes when I bought the gun and House Of The Dead 2 that there would be many shooters for the Dreamcast, but all there is is the aforementioned and the Saturn Virtua Cop 2 that was included in the Smash Pack.  Just because Sega is the only one still making shooting games (but not making an official gun??) doesn't make this one a great game.  The voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard, and the main character is a James Bond wannabe.  This game can be completely finished in 2-3 hours including the training missions.  It seems to use the exact same engine as HOD2 with no enhancements, but a lot less gore.  This game is at most worth a rent, not a purchase.  But it is significantly better than those ... titles on Playstation, so if you need an impulse purchase, do get this one."
2257,3,"WWF Smackdown: Just Bring It has great gameplay and grapics.  But, graphics are not everything.  Although this game has over 70 matches and over 30 WWF superstars, the ""Story Mode"" is very, very poor.  I know as a wrestling fan, this is probably the most important mode in a wrestling game.  You pick a wrestler and then you try to go out and win a title.  After you win a title, you have to go out and defend it.  Not in this game.  In past Smackdown games for PlayStation 1 has an enhanced story mode.  I am dwelling on this because it's the funnest thing to do in wrestling.  Although the story mode is poor, who wouldn't want over 70 matches.  This is a very fun game though."
2258,3,This was a gift. She said it was really awesome right up until she got stuck and no amount of internet diving got us a solution. So she only got about a week out of it. Not worth it.
2259,3,"The wires are inexpensive and measure in around 4-5 feet.
They work fine and were not difficult to set up or use.
You may notice a slight difference in picture quality, but the Wii picture quality caps at 480p.

Pros:
-Inexpensive
-Works without rigging

Cons:
-Short Cable
-No Wii U Compatibility."
2260,3,"I bought the Vita to use it in conjunction with my PS4 for Remote Play. Living in a one bedroom apartment with another person, there is only so much TV time I could command to play video games. I thought getting a Vita and using Remote Play would be a great way to compromise. Unfortunately, it was a pretty underwhelming experience. It's difficult to use a DualShock 4 controller with it and using the PS Vita controls (even though you can customize them) are difficult to use with PS4 games. The lag was generally pretty bad as well even when I would have great internet connection (hardwired PS4, Vita near the PS4/router).

I just couldn't find enough use to keep it, so I ended up selling it. Too many of the features get overshadowed by my PS4, so for me personally, it didn't end up serving any purpose after the novelty of Remote Play wore off. If you are planning on buying PS Vita games, I'm sure this system would be great; though if you are buying it solely for Remote Play, I would reconsider."
2261,3,"I just received the video game today and was excited to play once I got home from work. Installed everything, clicked 'Click to Play', then a Windows Live log in appears. Okay whatever, I'll register an account. Registered, logged in and Windows Live tells me I have to update my profile. Sure! Game needs to restart.

Finally done!

Log in. Oh wait, another message telling me I have to update.

Okay, now I get to play.

No, log in and update again.

Okay, for reals now I get to play.

...Are you serious? Update again?

(Fourth time, if you lost count)

Can I play now?

NO! UPDATE AGAIN!

I'm on my FIFTH update now as I am typing this.

** Update**

I had to update five times. It took me over 30 minutes.

I'm going to bump this to 3 stars because the game is simply fantastic.
Gameplay is easy but if you're more interested in the storyline, it's a must!!

0 stars for windows live
5 stars for batman

since you need both, 3 stars!"
2262,3,This game was not worth 50 bucks. all characters play basically the same just with different skins and your custom character won't end up being too different from one of the z-fighters or a saiyan
2263,3,Too futuristic.
2264,3,"This is a decent headset that unfortunately I cannot recommend because of one major issue.

First, the good news: sound quality is fine (I've heard much better, but at the $30-40 price point it's reasonable); the headset seems to be durable and is very flexible around the top (unfortunately the same is not true of the over-ear area).  The 3.5mm audio cable is standard and will work with just about any computer, phone, or other device -- Sades sells a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/special-adapter/dp/B012FG9TJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">special adapter</a>&nbsp;for compatibility with the PS3/XBOX360 that is not necessary if you are just listening, but will be needed if you intend to use the microphone.

For some reason the manufacturer decided to angle the ear contacts in what seems to me to be the wrong direction.  The result is that the speakers do not sit properly over the ears.  Anyone familiar with over-ear headphones knows that it's incredibly important that the ear cushions make contact with your head on all sides - it's essential for optimal sound quality, as well as keeping external noise out.  Because I have a ""normal"" head and the positioning of the ear contacts are not adjustable, I can only assume that most people will have this same problem.  I had other members of my family try them on and achieved the same result... the headset just does not sit right.

Unfortunately the inability to find a comfortable fit renders this headset useless to me.  It seems to be a good product, except for that one major deal-breaker.

I received this product for free for review purposes, and I would like to thank the manufacturer for the opportunity to test them."
2265,3,It has a bold look to it but I thought the characters where not very interesting and had to force myself to finish the game.
2266,3,My son had Max 2 and wanted to try this one so we purchased it for his Xbox as he did not have many game for the system. He did not find this game to live up to the previous one. He got bored easily and was not able to play for extended periods of time as he does with other games. The graphics in the game were good and the story line was decent but the game seemed to have glitches in it which he did not like.
2267,3,"I enjoy playing the Myst games once through, they are fun and challenging. However my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason, and I was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover. Even if I had, I would never play the game again, I would know how to do everything, and therefore, what would be the point? At least it is better then Myst in which you can win within about 15 minutes of starting the game, but still... Any 60 dollar game (as it was when it was released) should last longer than this. With the detail put in, the game itself is rather short, with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time. Also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do, but can't (the stopping the scopes thing, the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island). I thought it was a beautiful game, but I wouldn't get it unless it is below 20 dollars, otherwise I don't really think it's worth it."
2268,3,"So far so good.  My only complaint is the LED lights are very bright, it even bothers me when trying to watch TV on how much light this thing gives off. Going to try and find a better place to put this item which is annoying since I want it by my PS4."
2269,3,"I wanted to complete Final Fantasy XIII before I wrote an adequate review and I'm glad I did. As we all know, FFXIII has gotten a lot of bad publicity from everyone. Well I can honestly say that it's not as bad as what everyone says nor is it as good as what big publications say either. The game itself is just okay, the end period.

Point 1-Linearity. All the complaints about the game is actually justifiable, it's absolutely linear, completely non interactive, and just plain sterile. The exaggerated notion that the game is basically a corridor game is in truth correct. The layout of the each section in the game is just going from point A to point B, nothing more nothing less. There are branching parts that leads to either dead ends or treasure but even then its far and few. From beginning to end the players will be following a set path that leads from start to finish. This game is the absolute pinnacle of linearity, not even the original Final Fantasy 1 was like this.

Point 2-Towns/NPC. Towns are completely devoid of interactivity. I wouldn't say there are no towns because there are, three actually. But what you can do withing those towns are pretty much none existence. You won't able to visit homes because there are none, you won't be able to purchase items because items, accessories, and weapons are bought through save points, and you won't be able to speak with NPC's because they talk automatically once you move by them. It's more as if you're hearing them speak when you pass by than it is actually starting a conversation with them. The towns are also like the rest of the maps, its basically once again going from point A to point B.

Point 3-Battle system. The battle system is a mixed bag for me, sometimes I enjoy it, sometimes I don't, and sometimes it feels very boring and like a chore. If you're unaware of FFXIII's battle system its completely new to the series. Your party consists of three members, and players only control the party leader the rest of the members are AI controlled. Battles occur in real time and are pretty fast. I wouldn't say its lighting fast, but its faster than the rest of the main series. To help players easily navigate through the speed of the battle system there is an auto button that will smartly choose what actions to take during battles. If you want to still manually input your commands you can also do so, but you would have to have pretty fast reflexes and cognitive decisions to keep up with the pace. Actions are separated into sections bars and commands are inputted and queued awaiting the ATB bar to fill up before proceeding. For example, when you have three action bar you could press attack, attack, attack during the time the ATB is filling up and once it does the action is performed. There are also different roles for each of the party members to change into which will change the abilities available. These role are similar to tanks, casters, buffers, healers etc. It's every similar to Final Fantasy X-2 dress grid, where you're able to change into a different dress to again different abilities, expect in FFXIII you won't be changing dresses. These role swaps are crucial to defeating enemies so don't think that you can tank your way through the entire game. You have to strategically swap roles or enemies and especially bosses will decimate your party. There are no magic points in the game so you can use as much magic as possible and items are distributed throughout your entire party. At the end of the each battle your party's HP will replenish itself so there's no need to heal outside of battles. Whether all this is a deal breaker to players or not, I can see why the developers decided on these choices. You will be battling a lot of enemies throughout the game so its very counter intuitive if you have to heal yourself after every battle. The game also doesn't provide you with a lot of items nor money, and purchases are only available through save points so it doesn't make sense to have to heal outside of battles. It's basically all about stream lining the game and these choices help to really keep the pace smooth and consisting.

Now like I mentioned earlier the battle system is sometimes fun and sometimes a chore. I saw a video review where the reviewer summed up the battle system as pressing X, X, L1, and X. Unfortunately, that's pretty much what the battle system is. You press X to select your option, then L1 to change roles, and followed by your last Xs to finish the command. Every battle consists of this formula and as you play further in the game, it becomes extremely boring. There's also the complaint that once your party leader dies, the game ends. Well I don't have a problem with that because you can always retry the battle if you die. What's good about this is that when you retry you get the option to change your battle configuration and updates to your character before engaging the enemy again. What I found extremely annoying withing the first 30 hrs are the sections where certain battles are meant for certain party members, and when engage your configurations are reset. I often died during these sections to have to retry and reset my party configurations. It was a major annoyance to me.

Okay for the good, FFXIII has amazing graphics for this generations RPG. It's very sad that the graphics are restricted to the narrow environments, but its beautiful graphics non the less. The story is also pretty good, in fact the story was actually the part of the game that kept me playing.

As far as how the game is, I found it to be okay and only okay. I'm not sold on the battle system, it was fun at first until I realized the basic fundamentals and it became boring. I absolutely did not enjoy the linearity of the game and its non interaction. People like to compare FFXIII to FFX, well in a sense they are similar but not exact. FFX was linear but here's where the line is drawn. You can interact with NPC, explore towns, buy items from item shops, backtrack to a previous area, participate in mini games and side quests, revisit towns, and explore hidden areas when you have access to an air ship in FFX. FFXIII has non of that, you can't backtrack, you can't interact with NPCs, there are no mini games and only one side quest, no revisiting towns, and no air ship. What you can do is participate in a side quest that involves hunting down creatures, similar to FFXII ""Hunt Marks"" side quests, upgrade your weapon and accessories, and collect trophies. Reviewers like to say that the linearity ends at a certain part within the game near the end, well that's just not true. What they are talking about is the option to re-explore a vast area that consists of a gorge and monsters exactly like FFX's ""Calm Land"" just larger. This is also the area where you take part in the monster hunt side quest, which in turns take you all over gran pulse again. And again area to area, point A to point B.

So, should FFXIII be played or avoided all together? Well honestly it depends. I did have fun during my time with the game, it just wasn't as fun as the rest of the series. I had a lot of moments of boredom and irritations and a few moments of awe and wows. But honestly this game should at least be rented and tried out. It's not the most disgusting and worst FF series developed, but it's not the next generation FF we were all expecting. After all, besides the graphics there's nothing in FFXIII that couldn't have been done with the last generation consoles."
2270,3,"This game is much better on PC. The PS2 just does not give it justice. The controls are hard to handle, and the game is very, very blurry making it hard to spot enemies. I believe this was ported over to PS2 resulting in the mishaps. Excellent game, just not on PS2. Buy this for PC."
2271,3,"+ PROS:

+ Vivid depictions of Hell
+ Upgradable artifacts and combat techniques
+ Unique gameplay feature of absolving/condemning souls
+ Lots of extras, including the first portion of Dante's Divine Comedy, ""Inferno""

- CONS:

- Looks and plays very similar to the God of War series
- Only takes 1-2 days to complete (roughly 5-6 hours of gameplay)
- Repetitive enemies
- No incentive to play on higher difficulty settings

PLOT:

In this game, we're in control of Dante Alighieri, a poet...er...a knight during the Crusades. He's committed heinous acts, but Dante was assured by a bishop that his sins would be pardoned after the fact.  When he arrives home, he discovers his true love, Beatrice, has been murdered and her soul is in peril at the hands of Lucifer. In order to save Beatrice, Dante must traverse the levels of Hell and face each of his personal demons along the way.

GAMEPLAY:

This game is set in a 3rd person hack & slash mode, with platforming and puzzle elements. Dante has Death's scythe and Beatrice's cross as his weapons.  Each level has various hidden items including pieces of silver, Holy and Unholy artifacts, and Shades - people Dante comes across which he can choose to absolve or damn for their past misdeeds.

A mini-game appears when we choose to absolve someone, and this offers us a Holy points bonus multiplier, depending on how many sins are caught. Damning someone has no mini-game but rewards us with Unholy points.

During his journey, Dante gains Holy or Unholy experience points which he can use to purchase powerful attack combinations, increase his health/magic levels, and so forth. There are 4 levels of difficulty which can be changed at any time during the game.

The game also has different puzzle types including block puzzles, weighted switch puzzles, mystery door puzzles, and several others.

Dante's Inferno also offers extra modes including unlocked movies, gameplay cinematics, behind the scenes videos, a challenge mode, and more. The entire canto of Dante's Inferno is included and can be read in a top-down scrolling format.

BUT DOES IT FOLLOW THE PLOT OF THE DIVINE COMEDY?

Well, yes and no. It's clear the game designers put in a LOT of effort and research into making this game, and there are a lot of similarities to Dante's written work - the levels of Hell, the descriptions of several sinners and their sins found in each area were extremely well done.

However, the most glaring contradiction is this: In the game, Dante's journey through the underworld is more of a quest to save Beatrice, whereas in the poem Dante was accompanied by Virgil to travel through the levels of Hell, and Beatrice was rarely mentioned at all.

TROPHIES:

There are 43 trophies to earn in this title; and 12 more if you purchase the 2 DLC packs.

Most of the trophies in this title are fairly easy to obtain, but it can get frustrating because some of the items are hidden a little TOO well. There is no ability to change camera angles, so unless you know where to look, you'll miss a few things your first time through. There is no way to maximize your Holy and Unholy upgrades in one playthrough, so you'll have to play the game at least twice to accomplish this.

You cannot backtrack to previous levels after certain checkpoints are passed, so for the trophy hunters, I would highly recommend a strategy guide.

Most of the trophies aren't hard to earn but it does feel like a lot of busy work, similar to finding all the jumps in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Theft-Auto-IV/dp/B000HKP88C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Theft Auto IV</a>.

- CONS:

First and foremost, this game feels and plays a LOT like God of War. When I first played this game, I felt like I was playing a clone. The combat uses a similar fighting engine, some of the puzzles require moving boxes to certain areas, and boss battles have Quicktime events. Since these elements were all used in the God of War series, it felt like Dante's Inferno copied what worked in those games, but didn't add much of anything new. It's not a bad game, but we've seen this kind of gameplay used several times before.

The time to completion also counts against this game. It only takes about 5 hours to complete the main storyline. Unless you're a trophy hunter, there is really no desire to play through the game a 2nd time because there is only one possible ending.

As far as the enemies go, they're unique but they eventually become repetitive. As we progress, the same enemies keep showing up, just in greater numbers. After we power up our weapons to Ludicrous level, the enemies doesn't offer much of a challenge.

Finally, there is no incentive to play the game through on harder difficulty settings. You can beat this game on the easiest setting and get all the trophies.

I found myself wishing the developers had a trophy for completing the game on the hardest difficulty setting like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bioshock/dp/B001B1W3GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bioshock</a>&nbsp;games, but that wasn't done here. This could have added a lot more replay value and challenge for the trophy-hungry gamers.

FINAL VERDICT?

While this game obviously had a lot of love, exhaustive research and effort put into it, the similar gameplay to the God of War series and the low level of completion difficulty make this game an above-average rental. I've played through it 3 times, but unless I want to read the entire Canto of Inferno, I doubt I'll play it again.

Trophy hunters? This game will bump up your status a bit.
Casual players? If you've already played God of War, you'll feel like you already played this.

There are two more books in The Divine Comedy: Purgatorio and Paradiso. If a new gameplay mechanic is introduced or a trophy is offered for completing the game on the highest difficulty setting, I might give those sequels a try."
2272,3,"I really enjoy this game, even now that I've reached Inferno. The gameplay is fun, and the story is at least acceptable. However, once you reach Level 60 (the max level) with a character, the game's level of fun starts to readily decline. Frankly, there's just not enough to do. The only reason I'm ever even tempted to play with a Level 60 character any more is to try to kill enough enemies to find an item that I can sell in the game's real-money auction house. Even that is a joke, though, because nothing sells there - and the few things that do sell are sold for so cheap that no one makes money besides Blizzard.

The DRM is probably the most annoying part of this game. I hate the fact that I have to always be online. I hate it, because it means that if Blizzard has to do server maintenance, or Blizzard's servers crash, or a myriad of other things, then I can't play the game that I paid an inflated $60 for. To me, that is ridiculous.

I still think the game is worth buying, especially for casual gamers like me. There are at least 50-100 hours of fun in this game, which for me is quite good. I also expect that the game will get better with the eventual release of PvP. If the game sounds fun to you, then get it. Chances are, it will be fun, at least for a good while. However, make sure that you are aware of the issues, and the annoyances."
2273,3,"Solid story, not very glitchy, but I feel dirty playing as a templar...."
2274,3,Interesting.
2275,3,"The Good: 6 fun games in one, each game is varied, catchy music

The Bad: A few games are difficult, some control issues, 3D effects are distracting, only good in short bursts

If you are a fan of classic 8-bit games or quick simple games then you will be right at home here. Bit. Trip Saga takes all the games in the series and packs it into one game. There are 6 games here, but each are different and require lots of concentration and good hand-eye coordination to have some fun. Let's dig into this pile of pixels and see what's in store.

Bit. Trip Beat is one of my favorite because it's a variation on Pong where you repel pixels coming at you to create a catchy beat. It gets harder and harder as time goes on and is a blast. If you miss too many the game will go in Nether mode which actually turns the game 8-bit and is really neat. The 3D effects here are nice but are distracting and use the circle pad is useless and inaccurate. I chose the stylus for precise aiming because you will need it.

Bit. Trip Core is one of my least favorites because of how hard it can be to watch four sides of the screen at once. You stay in the middle and control a beam to destroy pixels coming at you from all sides. This can get confusing and it's really hard to play for long periods of time. I didn't play this one as much and was a bit of a disappointment.

Bit. Trip Void is another favorite because it doesn't require such concentration and accuracy. You are a black hole that collects black pixels and avoids white. When you are too big to fit on-screen, or between two pixels, you pop and bank your score. This one is highly addictive and I wound up playing for longer sessions then the other games.

Bit. Trip Runner is my favorite of them all because it's the biggest game of the six and most fun. You run down a level and avoid obstacles by jumping, kicking, sliding, and timing things just right to a super catchy beat. At the end of each level you go into an 8-bit version to collect gold and rack up your score. There are tons of levels here, but it can be very difficult towards the end because it requires perfect timing.

Bit. Trip Fate isn't one of the best because you are on a set path and have to avoid enemy fire while firing back. Dodging fire on a set path seems like it works against you and isn't really all that fun even if you do concentrate. The game has a slow pace and also requires right-handed stylus use.

Bit. Trip Flux is the last of the six which is like an anti Bit. Trip Beat. You avoid getting hit instead of hitting objects and is just as addictive as Beat. I found this to be one of the more fun games of the six and is super fun to play for long periods of time.

The whole experience is nice, but in short bursts only due to the repetitiveness and sheer concentration needed to get far in the game. This is great for a portable experience, but the 3D effects are distracting and with some games it made the experience worse. This game isn't just for anybody, but for hardcore gamers who love racking up scores and like precision skills and twitch shooting."
2276,3,"I need install disk.
In the very good condition, the disk must be packed too, otherwise I cannot run this wheel."
2277,3,This is OKAY but I was the unlucky being who got a mic that didn't work. Nothing on the internet to tell me what my issue was. Thanks google. :/ Don't even say bing. Bing was telling me to get a new one. Not like the mic mattered anyway. The mic quality sucks butt. And uhhh I mainly got these because they were in my budget & LED.
2278,3,"Pros:

- standard FPS elements work well: shoot, duck, zoom in, yadda yadda, standard weapons function well

- map seems fine. stuff is were it says it is. objectives are marked.

- sound is top-notch, Battlefield: Bad Company quality.

- wide-open levels

- feels like a Battlefield type game (same dev as previous titles - but not Bad Company)

- some minor amount of destroyable environments

- drones (tiny vehicles) implemented very well. This is probably the game's one hook. The drones are a real pleasure to use (maybe the controls could be better for the rover you have to drive) and hopefully more developers will work these into their games...

- 50-player online matches

Neutral:

- no cover system, but so what

- number of re-spawns per level. Yikes, that's pretty idiotic. Especially if you plan to play this on the most difficult setting. I put this in the neutral category because it never affected me (only died a few times on the normal setting). But it's a frightening prospect if you are a noob gamer. Want to reach the very end of a level after an hour of play and have to start from the beginning?

- graphics and textures are okay. But there isn't much wow or zing here. No color or pizzazz. I realize we're in the desert much of the time, and much of the cities are bombed out ruins, but gimme something pretty to look at once in awhile.

- some minor framerate or pop-in gripes. I don't recall if page-tearing was an issue.

Cons:

- some odd engine behaviors. Step out of a tank in a certain place, it automatically blows up. Vehicles spawn in and out like that. These don't really impede progress in the game, but they are extremely goofy.

- odd enemy spawning. They seem to spawn from nowhere, sometimes right behind you.

- Halo-style vehicle controls, which is normally fine, but they work very clunky here. Often becomes awkward or impossible to back up in a vehicle, especially a tank.

- little in the way of options and customization of controls (or anything). Don't like the control scheme? Tough luck buddy.

- Cannot perform simple functions that most FPS games have, such as pick up enemy weapons, swap, etc.

- Friendly AI can't hit the broad side of a war. I think the kill ration was me: 99.99%, friendly AI: 0.01% (sometimes shooting at me or my vehicle trying to hit an enemy in front of me).

- Friendly vehicle AI can box you in sometimes. If I'm trying to move my tank, please get the hell outta my way.

- Enemy AI seems to be able to rush right out of a structure, blind fire and automatically hit you several times before you can even remotely react...

- AI in general is goofy. You'll often have enemies and squad mates running right past each other or standing right next to each other, never seeing each other, never firing.

- Very poor availability of the machine gun (my favorite). It was only available in a couple of levels from memory.

- Only 8 levels. The ones they give you are large, yes, but those are still over quite quickly, say 20-45 minutes per level (depending on your skill level). The game can be beaten in a few short hours. This is the game's KEY flaw. They probably figure the multiplayer makes up for the short campaign. They'd be wrong.

- Lack of online game mode variety.

- No offline multiplayer whatsoever. No offline co-op. What's that about?

- The story. Sure oil is a hot-button topic, but war with the Russians? Again? People need to stop recycling old bogeymen and enemies. Battlefield Bad Company (a much more fun game) also did this in 08. Of course, if you are a Republican, you'll probably love this theme (especially considering current events with Georgia), you'll be afraid of Russians (and everything that ain't just like you) and this'll be right up your alley."
2279,3,too pricey but works good
2280,3,ok
2281,3,"We have 3 trivia types of games for Wii:  Smarty Pants, You Don't Know Jack (YDKJ), and Jeopardy!  Smarty pants isn't horrible but its the least favorite of those 3 comparable games.  It can be fun and it can also be very frustrating.  Sometimes you can play an entire game where the questions are very easy or very difficult within the same game.  When it's playing easy, medium, and hard at the same time its fun, otherwise it's annoying if they're all too hard or too easy.  Some of the questions are just so off the wall like ""What company published [insert book name here]""?  This games tries to be like Trivial Pursuit but doesn't do as good of a job at it as Jeopardy! does being like Jeopardy.  And YDKJ is just a highly unique and entertaining game.  Other annoyances of Smarty Pants are: When nobody answers correctly the correct answer is given but it goes by in an eye blink and you often miss it, sometimes you never get the correct answer, and although the physical aspects to the game can be fun if you're in the mood for it sometimes you just want to chill and play some trivia not dance around the room or play tug of war.  Finally, their are times where you play ""sudden death"" rounds with your opponent and have to answer questions until you miss.  If you happen to be player one then a big green arrow blocks your view of the question for about 1/4 of your alloted time often leaving you with insufficient time to answer the question.  If you have other trivia games that you like I wouldn't buy this one unless you get tired of the others and if you don't have any trivia games then I suggest YDKJ or Jeopary! first."
2282,3,"I had read reviews of this online before purchasing and the reviews were ""average"". I knew I was still going to buy it even knowing there were ""camera issues"" among other problems. I was just too big a Looney Tunes fan to pass it up. However, after playing it, I must confess that if I knew then what I know now, I would not have purchased it even at $39.99. The problem is not necessarily the camera (although there are definite issues there) but it is what I perceive as outright bugs. Example: In the second mission of the second level (Escape from Camelot), I got to a point where I had killed a robot on a platform but didn't make the jump to the next platform in time. Killing the robot triggers the platform to move. No big deal? Well, if you restart from the checkpoint, the robot is no longer there so nothing triggers the platform to move. My only option is to restart the entire mission. This also happened on level 1. Normally, I would not review something without at least being halfway through but I thought people should be aware of this. Overall, I still rank it average since it is a fun game, reasonably priced, etc. Certainly not one of the best games out there out. Spend wisely."
2283,3,Good game
2284,3,Did not work. Returned.
2285,3,This is a poor man's GTA.  Very repetitive gameplay and the main storyline is OK at best. I had it for 3 weeks and just traded it in for a different game. I'd say wait until it hits $20 but by then GTAV will be out on the X1 so at that point there will literally be no reason to buy this game.
2286,3,"While I enjoyed this game, it's quite different from the first RollerCoaster Tycoon. (Which we all know was a fantastic game.) The money system was kind of confusing to me, and I don't think the ""maps"" were that unique or different. To be honest, I would either pass on this RollerCoaster Tycoon and stick to the first one, or skip this one altogether and head for the third game in the series."
2287,3,"Graphics look good, but there are a lot of tasks to complete in each scenario. Just as fun as Tropico 3."
2288,3,3 stars only because why the hell am I spending $100 on top of the $200 vita? Well played Sony...
2289,3,"I'm a pretty big fan of Lost and normally I don't play games that are based on movies or television.  Why?  Because they usually end up being terrible and really can't capture the essence of the show.  This game appears to be no exception to that rule.  I should've known based on the novels written outside the series, which also weren't all that great.  One thing I will say though, this game is better than those novels.  Maybe once the full mythos is revealed and the spin off literature can use the full breadth of Lost, then it will be excellent.  Until that happens... I fear we are doomed to mediocre stories based on Lost that can't reveal anything very new to us.

That being said one of the main reasons I did not like this game very much is the game play in general.  I feel like the controls were a little clunky and the environments can be somewhat hard to navigate.  Though this is the whole point when you go out in the jungle, and for that it's okay.  As an example, though, whenever you go into the Banyan trees to escape the smoke monster you emerge facing toward the camera so pressing forward brings you back into the trees.  In a section where escape and time are important this is ridiculous.  The missions where you have to run to escape something are more frustrating than fun.  It's very difficult, at times, to see what it is you need to jump over.  So this kind of functionality wasn't winning any points from the video game perspective.

Another point of contention was the voice actors.  Locke sounded completely different, which is kind of annoying.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if you're going to make an official game I like the original people involved.  That probably costs too much though, and this is yet another reason I tend to stay away from these off shoot games.

As far as the level design goes it's actually not too bad.  Ubisoft is big with things like Myst, so I would expect them to be able to capture an environment competently.  On this point the game scores pretty well with me.  I love exploring the various stations like the Pearl and the Flame.  I loved being responsible to push the buttons and seeing the maps.  I loved that I could explore much more of the Flame than we get to see in the show.  All of this was great and I enjoyed doing it.  Going to the Dark Territory and going through the slaver ship was awesome as well.  If you get that out of the game it's quite fun.

Here's where it sort of fell apart.  The story line.  The story line is just okay, in my opinion.  I think it breaks some Lost rules and brings up events that are too specific that they wouldn't be known in the show, such as your character saving Jack and Kate.  It's a bit too significant for it to never be brought up.  You basically play as someone who has lost their memory and upon waking up on the island after the plane crash you can't remember who you are.  The pace is almost way too fast, Jack appears to distrust you for no apparent reason for most of your time in the group.  Aside from going into the jungle when he told no one to go there, which in the show is a really minor offense for Jack, it seems to ruin his entire perception of you.  I guess I don't get it, while the characters were a bit close, they don't seem to be close enough to the show.  Their actions and motivations seem a bit odd to me.

In the end, if you're a die hard Lost fan then you will enjoy some aspect of this game.  I loved exploring the island and doing things in the various stations.  I did not like some of the controls from a gamer's perspective.  So there's a little give and take with this game, which is why I think it's only an average game at best."
2290,3,The gameplay is pretty boring but it's okay game
2291,3,"Starts off great, but then drift mode gets irritating and the money / upgrades does not really apply after level 2.  It was worth the money, but was glad I only spent $15.00 for it."
2292,3,"I'll make this review short and sweet...

The game play is fun, overall. The controls in my opinion can be annoying and not always accurate. Making Sonic go backwards is a joke at best.

The game is good enough to pass some time with but I don't look forward to playing it when I get home the way I do other Wii games...like Excite Truck or Elebits."
2293,3,"The game requires you to go around and ""help"" people. Its a bit of a quest/mob grind, but otherwise okay. The graphics are amazing, and as an expirenced gamer it's worth the money as long as you don't mind a grind. Walking takes ages and you have to go very long distances between quests, but there are also the good ol' world events that people can participate in. Its good as you don't loose kills, or quest items if someone ""takes it"" from you. Either way, weigh the F2P over P2W and F2P wins for me. Not worth my $20."
2294,3,"If you have control freeks and are looking to get this controller. DONT GET IT. Unless you can afford to take it apart and replace the thumb sticks.

No joke, I have the Xbox One Vortex and I Can't get them to fit my analog sticks its agervating. Just spent $40 on this controller and it doesn't even work with my $20 accessories. (I don't know about squidgrips) but don't get it if you like control freeks.

One thing I should mention however, Mine did not come with a mini usb cable. It says ""WIRED XBOX ONE CONTROLLER"" yet it had no cable when I unboxed it. So its very misleading. Technically to be fair, it is a wired controller because you can't use it wirelessly (meaning to place to insert batteries)

Just so disappointed as a 360 fan of this series, for the Xbox one version to be so bad.

edit : just found the usb cable (it was hidden behind the case) got to play with it for around an hour and it feels even better than the stock controller. Hell I don't even need kontrol freeks anymore for the Xbox One with this controller."
2295,3,"Okay, I found myself deciding between this game and some others, and I kinda wish I would have gotten one of the others, but overall, I'm not complaining.

When I first started playing this game I was like, wow, I can tell this is gonna be a really good game, just by the AMAZING opening cinema...turned out to be a ""meh"" game.  Has its good points, has its bad points, but nothing to write home about.

Here's why I only gave it 3/5.

-Card battle system.  If I wanted Yu-Gi-Oh, I would have bought it.  If I wanted to play Magic: The Gathering, I would have bought that as well.  The graphics on the cards are very well done, and some of the descriptions are funny, but still..its card battle and I hate that.  I'd rather have a judgement wheel like Shadow hearts 2 or old school rpg action like Final Fantasy.

-Lack of cinemas.  When I saw the opening video to this game while watching the title screen, I almost fell off my chair!  I couldn't wait to get going and get into the story!  However, after finishing disk 1 and getting 3/4 of the way through disk 2, I was incredibly dissapointed to find out there were NIL, NADA, ZERO, ZILCH FMVs.  Thats not really a thing I look for in a game, but when they put a simply AWESOME opening intro fmv to the game, and not include those same fmvs in the actual game at critical plot points, it really sucks.

-Sound.  I just had to turn off character voices.  Not that they are done bad, just the people's voices they picked to do the characters are annoying and get to me.  I really didn't like Kalas' character voice, Xhela's voice gets reeeeeeeaaallly annoying after hearing her name off all her spells as she fires them off in fights.

-Experience points, leveling up and acquiring money. Now I was kinda on the fence with this one.  Its different from any other RPG I've played, so I can't decide if its good or bad.  You technically kill monsters over and over for experience points till you level up like any other rpg, but in order to level up, you have to go to a church and pray to level up.  There is no indicator how much xp till your next level either, so you just have to make periodic visits to the church to level your character up.  You don't get money from monsters by killing them either like other rpgs, you have to take pictures with a camera (yes that's right there's a card that lets you take pictures of monsters), then you sell the pictures at stores for cash.

PROS:

-Simply AMAZING graphics.  The opening cinema on the title screen had me hooked on this game, just waiting to learn the plot.  The worlds are beautiful and something completely new to the rpg scene (everyone lives on floating islands, almost everyone has wings).  Every character and monster and spell/special move has great graphics as well.

-In-depth and deep plot.  Like I said, I don't like card battle rpgs, so I was forcing myself to keep playing the game (I hated the fights), but there are many plot twists and turns that keep you shocked and intrigued...::spoiler alert::  Most of the best plot stuff happens at the end of disc 1.  The game setting was really well-done also..I loved the setting.

Other than the flaws I listed above this game could have been a SOLID 5/5 or even 6/5 had the creators made it not a crappy card rpg, got different actors for the voices (you'll see what I mean if you play this), and put in some FMVs to help the story at critical plot points.  I would definitely not buy this game, this is more of a rental..but the game is so long and in-depth it may take you a few weeks to beat it :)"
2296,3,"This game has sweet graphics, awesome music and great wacky characters but something's missing. First of all, it takes 1 hour to beat the game and second it'boring after you play it for an hour.
GRAPHICS:10/10. By far the biggest plus in the graphics are the beutifully rendered backgrounds. 3-D people cheer for you others mind there own buisness. Most of the characters look great too, but some (such as king) aren't very well done.
SOUND:9/10: There's not much to say. Great punching noises and Japanese voices. The music is awesome.
CONTROL:8/10. It's your standard fighting game affair. Two punch buttons two kick buttons. It responds quick enough but there's nothing ground breaking.
RENTING FUN FACTOR:10/10. I rented this game before I bought it and it was VERY fun, but after awhile it's just boring. Definitely rent it.
BUYING FUN FACTOR:5/10: Even with all the pluses in T-T-T this game is just boring and has no replay value. The bowling side game is extremely fun though. 2-player is as boring as one player."
2297,3,"The idea could've been better as the atmosphere wasn't as dark as the third game where shadows and darkened hall-way this game doesn't.  While the idea of the game placing you on a distant planet is a idea and have strange frightening sounds, it doesn't seem to stand up to number 3 for new accomplishments.  Adding to the game with weapon upgrades, which is a nice idea but not sure if it was worth it, challenge zones don't sem like they belong in this game at all."
2298,3,"If you've been looking for a collection of mini-games for a Wii Party but have been turned off by the lack of captivating characters, then this is the answer you've been looking for.  The Toy Story gang are here to provide you with a variety of midway games for you and others to enjoy.  Well, kind of.

While the majority of the games are a variation on the same shooting gallery concept, the other games you will find are really hit and miss.  Some ""Simon Says"" style games that involve shaking the Wii Remote mixed in with ski ball and probably the strangest version of the popular Breakout game I've seen can only provide a detour for so long.  However, once you get yourself a large group of competative players, the type of game really doesn't matter.  The amount of fun you'll be having makes up for it.

That said, this game is clearly made for multi-player play.  While you can play it in a single player mode for personal high scores, it isn't as fun."
2299,3,ive played this on ps3 and its amazing went to get it and the place i got it off of sent me a defective one but have refunded me my money and ill just buy it new off of amazon next time just the one bad order ive had out of hundreds from amazon
2300,3,"Maneuverability in this game is awful, it's very frustrating and annoying. Often your partner is completely useless, refusing to share ammo & guns, ignoring you when you need help, getting killed in stupid fashions, etc. Otherwise, it's a decent game. Interesting setting, challenging enemies. It's got a little bit on a Tomb Raider feel to it with the puzzles and artifacts."
2301,3,Didn't care for it.  Square base design on the stick.
2302,3,"now, is this a demo at $59.99????????
It sounds more like a rip off; the graphics and gameplay are good, no doubt about it; but the entire game is done in ~ 3 hours;
very disappointing compared to other games such as Assassin's Creed, Shadow of Mordor and I could go on and on;
I've purchased it used for $19.00 and IMHO that still is way to much for such a short game, period;"
2303,3,"This is a good expansion pack. In fact, I'd say it's one of the better ones that the company has put out. It has some flaws, of course...some game crashes and bugs and all...quite a few of them, in fact...but that seems to happen more and more since EA took over Maxis. (They don't 'polish' their games; they get them on the market as fast as possible.) However, I do have two major flaws that you should know about before you buy this:

1. It comes with 'anti-piracy' software. DRM. And you can't uninstall it, even if you uninstall the game. I'm not sure exactly what it does, but I've heard it's bad. EA thinks we're a bunch of thieves.

2. If you download EA's own patch for this expansion pack, the anti-piracy software in that patch conflicts with the anti-piracy software in the game itself. Result? It varies, from what I've heard. Some people haven't been able to start their game, after downloading it. While my own game started, after downloading the patch, many textures disappeared, making the game virtually unplayable. The only way to fix this is by uninstalling the expansion pack (loosing all your saved games, in the meantime) and praying that you still have both disks and the stupid code EA makes you enter to...surprise...make sure you aren't a pirate.

And whatever you do, don't download the patch again, after that. Maybe someday EA will make a better patch that doesn't ruin your game. Maybe they already have; I haven't checked the site lately. But I'm not taking my chances. I'm just going to grit my teeth and play the thing, bugs and all.

Like I said, other than that it really is a good expansion pack. Once you get past the bad things, it the hobby system really does add a lot of depth and personality to your game. So go ahead and get it, if you want; just know what you're getting into."
2304,3,ok
2305,3,Yawn.
2306,3,"When the Playstation 2's launch date was announced, so was a sequel to Metal Gear Solid which was on the original Playstation.  A year of waiting brought us Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.  I have always had the opinion that Metal Gear would be better served as a movie and for the most part Sons of Liberty is mostly movie.  The grpahics are outstanding and the gameplay is nicely done but there should have been more play and less movie.  For periods of up to twenty minutes you are beaten over the head with movies and dialouge.  The vioce acting is good, but with such a good game engine, why would you want to show all those pesky cut-scenes.  Grant it, you can skip them but you may find yourself not knowing what to do.  The stealth element of Metal Gear 2 is outstanding.  You can hide in everything from lockers to boxes.  You will also find that the time when you are playing, that Metal Gear's camera is pretty helpful, in most cases.  Sons of Liberty is easier then the original Playstaion game and does boast a better storyline.  The question is, does it have to much storyline?  Well I believe so.  I enjoy playing this game but it is easy to get turned off by the semingly constant cut-scenes.  Metal Gear Solid 2 is a solid game but it is not as great as all the hype you hear.  Undoubtably, this is not a game of the year contender, when compared to the masterpiece that is Grand Theft Auto III, even though they are different types of games.  This is dissopointing when you think about how long Playstation fans have been urning for an award-winning sequel.  The bottom line is the gameplay is great once you learn it. Once you wade through the movie you find a good game that is at least worth renting for the weekend, or if not buying it."
2307,3,"Decent game, no option for 1st person except for using ADS."
2308,3,This is a truely great game for GBA and Snes....however it is a near exact replica to the Snes version sound and all. My main problems w/ the game are the graphics...it looks like a child drew this. Donkey Kong is so hard with his jump moves too....
2309,3,Great!
2310,3,A bit flimsy feeling.  But will work.
2311,3,"This is the second EP installment for the TS4 franchise, and so far with this franchise it doesn't seem as if the dev team understands the gameplay depth we have come to expect for a $40 DLC. Yes, there are some shiny new things and a new big feature but at the very core, this route that the game is going down feels nothing like its predecessors; it is shallow at it's very core and I will explain why, and why this EP doesn't seem to help in a bit. But first, let's talk about what you can and can't do:

You can:
- drink brews that look suspiciously like beer :) via the bar object
- drink and make espresso using the new espresso machines, you can even get it in to go cups if you order it to go at a cafe
- form a club using the new club system (this is the big feature of the game, and it is actually very fleshed out); this is where you get to decide rules for what a group of sims can and can't do...do they spend their time only playing video games, or are they snobs who only want to look at art? This turns out to be a very kid and teen friendly feature, the first big step for any kind of focus outside of the Young Adult age group. There's a whole perks/rewards system associated with clubs.
- DJ via the DJ set. There is a new DJ skill associated with this
- dance via the new dance floor; you can now synchronize dance moves in a group (pairs nicely with the new club system)...you can even have dance offs with other groups. There is a new dance skill associated with this
- play a new board game called ""Don't Wake the Llama"", which is basically Jenga
- visit the new nightclub venue
- visit the new pub venue (which feels like a bar, except you can order food)
- visit the new cafe venue
- play on the new arcade machine
- swim in natural pools...which are just regular pools, just recolored
- use the new diving platform for pools (mind you, it's not what you think it is)
- purchase a closet object with sliding doors, there is a new woohoo interaction associated with this
- woohoo in a bush (it's an object you have to buy)
- choose the new Leader of the Pack aspirations which comes with the Natural Leader trait (related to the club system).
- choose the new Dance Machine trait (related to dancing) or the Insider trait (related to the club system)
- visit and live in a new town called Windenberg, a beautiful European looking town with a fake looking Lochness monster
- take advantage of the new ""public pool"" venue type (patched in)

You can't:
- do anything about dance-offs, you don't win anything. In fact, there's no point to dance-offs because there are no winners or losers
- play with any new lifestates like vampires because there are no new lifestates
- play with any new careers because there are no new careers. Remember the old games where they threw a bunch of new careers with each expansion? Why would they add the dance and DJ skills and not include those careers?
- craft brews...this would have been amazing if they made it like the nectar making skill from TS3 WA. Wasted opportunity
- change the cell phone skin like they advertised (this was patched in at a later date months after the game was released)

Seems like a lot of features (hence the 3 stars), so why do I think it's shallow? I am a player at heart. I loved TS2 and TS3 where there would be consequences for every little thing that you choose to do. This game added all these cool new features and don't link it to long term gameplay. For example, what's the point of learning the dance skill? There's no aspiration to win dance-offs, no moodlets for winning dance-offs, in fact...you can't even win the freaking dance-offs! Can you get a reputation for dancing well? The answer is no. Oh, you can't join the dancer career either because they didn't add that. How is that fun? You are just watching things happen,like I said there's no consequence for your actions.

Another example: natural pools....why? OK, they recolored the pool water so now it looks like a hot spring. That's neat, but it gets boring quickly. Are there special moodlets and consequences for using the natural colored pool? Perhaps it has healing and comforting properties? Nope. It's just a boring recolor.

Also, one aspiration and 2 and a half traits in a big, $40 EP? We have been asking for more since day 1. There are so few aspirations and they are churning these EPs out at the rate of 1 per year. You might ask at this point, what is going on at EA? No one knows, because they won't tell us stuff."
2312,3,The graphics are kinda bad... thats only becuase its some what old. even if the graphics are bad its is extemely realistic. one of the most impresive and gruesome things about this game is the massive amount of blood and gore and the realistic actions of your victoms. like you shoot someone in the chest with the 50 cal sniper rifle and they'll blow in half. shoot someone in the leg or arm with a pistol or weaker gun and they'll grip their arm. shoot it with a shut gun and it will get blown right off. their isn't really a plot to the game but if you love seeing lots of blood and killing stuff get this game.
2313,3,"FFXI is a cross-platform MMORPG with a control scheme to fit Playstation 2, PC and Xbox360.  However I really can't stand the KB controls in the PC edition(the mouse is totally useless) and many people including one of the reviewers here feels the same way.  The better contol schemes for this game requre you to hook up ether a Dual Schock 2 clone(something that functions just like a Playstation 2 controler) or the ""Xbox360 controler for Windows"".  Both of these can be configured to act like the console versions and make the game more playable on a PC so I'd reccomend these items as an aditional purchace with the game.

As for the game well...if you're looking for PvP you are buying the wrong game.  Also don't expect much of a solo experence as in this game you'll mostly be teaming up with the other players agnist the monsters from lvl 20 and up.  It's pretty much ok since the FFXI comunity can be pretty helpful and they all understand how long it takes to get top level in this game.

Personally I like the storylines in this game but if you're just starting out it'll take you while before you can fully enjoy them.  The main starting nation mission lines are availble at the start, and The Rise oF Zilart expansion kicks in after you reach rank 5 in your chosen nation.  The storlines of the other expasions can be done at any time but you're gonna want to get a few levels under your belt before trying them.  For example the first missions for Chains of Promithia start at a maxium lvl 30 cap.  Besides missions we have a few quests with intrestin stories as well, but I won't go too far into it here.

The other unique thing about FFXI vs other MMOs is the job system.  With most MMORPGs you are stuck with whatever class you start as for all of the time you play that game.  In FFXI there are over 20+ jobs a player can pick from with six jobs available at the start(the rest are unlocked via quests when a player gets his first job to lvl 30).  You can swap jobs at any time with the only thing being that all jobs start on lvl 1, but don't fret because the game keeps track of all the levels gain for each job.  This means you can be a lvl 30 Warrior one minute and a lvl 20 White mage the next if you wish...just talk to the moogle in your home ^^

This game has alot to offer but don't expect it to be an easy road....this is not World of Warcraft...it's a game for the long haul!  So if you wana make some cool friends and battle your way through come on in, but if you wana to solo and do PvP...this is probably not gonna be your game..."
2314,3,its a ok game but it gets old after a while but its better than some if your new to western games its decent
2315,3,"This game is visually stunning on the X-box.  Go to a cheat web site and learn how to unlock the JUGGY mode if you want an extra little show within the game.  Juggy mode only makes a difference for the first quarter of the game when you are being trained by the S&M Nun.  Overall, the game is o.k.  The story is not bad, the controls are easy to learn and your character has attitude which is pretty cool.  If the people who had developed this game had put a little more effort into the story and character development, this game would be on par with Tomb Raider.  As it is, though, you get to battle evil Nazis (always fun) and you get to suck a lot of blood (also fun).  My biggest complaint is the totally anti-climactic ending.  We go through hell and back (literally) to finally confront the two major bad guys.  And to get to this point you have to go through some pretty repetitious and monotinous game play.  You kill one of the major baddies, but you have no time to celebrate since the second major baddy is fighting you at the same time.  FINALLY you kill the second major baddy and ... thats it.  You give the finger to the corpse and the game ends !!!  How lame is that ???  With just a little more effor this game could have gone places.  As it is there will probably not be a sequal.  Too bad."
2316,3,"It is severely lacking content for a launch.  Compared to Street Fighter Alpha 3 (my personal favorite of the series) this really is an atrocity.  I'm a diehard Capcom fan and have stuck with them through the years but their reliance on DLC to continue to sell a product is abysmal and this game is a great example. I waited a few months to write my review because I wanted to see just how they handled it all and they have been giving the first two characters for free (Alex and Guile), but the real problem isn't the lack of characters.  It's the lack of classic modes that have been a part of fighting games for a long time.  The main single player mode is a joke.  As a veteran of the arcade days I expect 8-10 rounds against increasingly difficult fighters until I fight the boss and see an ending. It's not a huge request and is kind of a mainstay in this genre.  Well instead we get a story mode which contains 2-4 fights, with no difficulty setting, that are all very easy. I beat that section in a few hours.  You can see why people were upset because usually a story mode/arcade mode provides a decent 10-20 hours of fighting depending on how many characters there are. Anyways they definitely released the game a few months early which might have been nice if the online had been working but it was plagued with problems.

As far as the fighting goes they are good which is why the game still deserves 3 stars, but until the average modes of a game of this genre are included I would wait to buy it. It's worth about $15 right now in my opinion."
2317,3,"As a 3D fighting game, Castlevania: Judgment isn't bad.  This is probably the best fighting game that I've seen on the Wii besides&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tatsunoko-vs-Capcom-Ultimate-All-Stars-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B002DC8GFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars (Nintendo Wii)</a>.

That said, this is not Castlevania except for the use of character names and traits.  I didn't mind the whole manga/anime look in Castlevania Dracula X and Symphony of the Night.  However, this game uses the manga/anime look to a far extreme that makes them look more like anime characters cosplaying as Castlevania characters (if that makes sense).  This look is good as long as it works for the game like in the PSP title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BlazBlue-Calamity-Trigger/dp/B00354NBEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger</a>.

Overall, the game is a decent addition to your Wii game library.  As a fan of Castlevania, this game feels as though the creators were cashing in on the Castlevania title and franchise.

My one hope is to see the newest Castlevania addition,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castlevania-Lords-of-Shadow/dp/B002I0J6DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</a>&nbsp;on the Wii as a stand alone game and not a port.  We all know this won't happen...not anytime soon."
2318,3,Must have a hard drive in order to play. Had to go and buy and ended up paying more for the hard drive then it was worth to play the game.
2319,3,Very difficult game to play but price was too good and cheap to pass up so I purchased for my kids.
2320,3,"Silent Hill The Room plays like other Silent Hill games,with the exception of the players apt. area which is  first person. If your a fan of this series you'll probably like this game as it is the same format of previous silent hill games. My only complaint is I wish you could choose between 1st person or regular perspective. For me personaly I feel more like I'M in the game when its all First person like in the room. But I know diehard fans who are used to the format wouldnt like it. I just wish it was ALL first person perspective or at least you could switch between first and third on the fly. But still its another solid silent hill game,with the added feeling of being trapped in,like the title says ,THE ROOM."
2321,3,"i suppose if you're a die-hard Ben 10 fan, you could get this maybe on ebay or amazon for around 4-10 dollars. which is fine i mean, yeah, but the game is pretty much a rip off though. i mean, yeah you get to control the omnitrix, but you only get to be heatblast, four arms, wildvine, cannon bolt, and xlr8. if those are some of your favorite aliens then i'm not holding you back from buying this, but the thing that bugs me is, after you beat the game, in the last cut scene, you get the full omnitrix power back, and you STILL can't play as anybody else. so if you want the full omnitrix in a 3d platforming Ben 10 game, i'd say pick up Ben 10 alien force: vilgax attacks. but this game still is worth buying if you're okay with some restrictions."
2322,3,"Now, I know a lot of you people reading reviews are all, ""Well, you haven't played enough of it yet."" Oh, believe me, I have. I've played this game many times in the last 15 years (i.e., Mass Effect). But, unfortunately, this particular game is at best average. The game itself is massively beautiful on the PS4. But, that's really where it all ends. After that, it's just a cliche shooter full of average battles with enemies that continually respawn over and over, but for no real reason. The objective system treats you like you've never ever played a shooter before in your life and has massive amounts of never ending tutorials that you cannot shut off. So, let's get to the good first.

Good:
* Stunning graphics
* Decent controls
* Okay, that's about it

Bad:
* Everything else... No, really.
* The guns, lame
* The shield system, blah
* The enemies, annoying and not enough backstory to know why they are there
* The story, what story?
* Too many annoying tutorials and visual indicators telling you exactly what to do and where to go
* Limited controller remapping
* Too much chatter by the ghost
* Cut scenes take way too long (i.e., space flying scenes)
* The special powers are weak
* Silly shield system from Halo
* The levels are mostly barren and open. Yes, you can seek out areas with enemies as easily as you can avoid them.

Everything you liked about Mass Effect has been tossed aside and all of the rest that you didn't like was placed into this game. Ouch. It tries to be many games all at once, but succeeds at none of them particularly well. Games such as Mass Effect, Halo, Half Life, Killzone, any RPG, any random shooter and, believe it or not, Call of Duty. It's unfortunate too because this game had a lot of promise.

For example, at the end of each level, it arbitrarily forces your character into 'limited respawn mode'. What this means is that if you don't complete the ending battle without dying, you are forced to restart the ending battle over from the beginning no matter how far along you were or how long it took. With all other non-ending battles, you can respawn and continue where you left off. This is one of those game design ideas that is just outright stupid and unnecessary. I know why it was included (i.e., to make the game 'seem harder'), but it's really unnecessary. The ending battle is hard enough even without this extra unnecessary respawn constraint.

The other stupid thing is that throughout the levels, you see other MMO players running around and you can all join in to defeat local area bosses together. Unfortunately, with the 'limited respawn' final boss levels, you are firmly on your own. No multiplayer help here. Again, another arbitrary design decision on the part of the Bungie. If you're adding multiplayer coop to the game, then let the entire game be coop. Why pick certain areas and say, ""solo""? If you're going to do this, then just make the entire game an offline solo game. A game is either multiplayer or it isn't. This half-way in between stuff is for the birds.

The gameplay is a straightforward shooter with no real bells and whistles to make it stand out. What makes it even more average is all of the arbitrary intentional boss design limitations. If you want to play a better PS4 shooter, albeit somewhat short, I'd recommend Killzone Shadowfall over Destiny. While Killzone Shadowfall is just as graphically beautiful, it also has the gameplay to back up its looks.

Overall, I'd recommend you play this game as a rental to see if you're really going to like it.

Graphics: 5/5
Sound: 3/5 (where's the music?)
Gameplay: 2/5 (cliche)
Story: 2/5
Overall: 2.5/5 (rounded to 3 for Amazon)
Recommendation: Rent

Just as an FYI, I also got the Ghost Edition. While all of the extras are cool, including the motion activated Ghost... like the game's silly limitations, the Ghost model is limited to about 3 phrases and two sound effects. So, it's really not that compelling of an electronic toy. Though, it does look quite cool. Considering the cost of the Ghost edition, in combination with the quality of this game, the cost really isn't worth it."
2323,3,"If you like playing classic games on your Xbox, then you definitely need the Xgaming X-Arcade joystick (ASIN B00008ELB0 or B00006I5ZX), preferably the 2-player version.  I tried playing Joust, and the standard Xbox ""S"" controller was really holding me back.  These 80's games depend on ""button smashing"", and that's something the Xbox controller doesn't handle well."
2324,3,"I am a big fan of fishing games but this one really disappointed me.  I paid full price for the thing only to bring it back a few days later and get virtually nothing for it.  If you are into arcade type fishing games that are not realistic then you will enjoy this one.  I thought this game was going to be like Rapala on the ps2 but it's not.  I enjoyed rapala on the ps2 tremendously, but this new ps3 title failed IMO.  If you want a realistic fishing title, then avoid this one.  The graphics were great though and the fish looked very cool but the gameplay is horrid.  I gave it a 2 for fun, and 3 for graphics."
2325,3,Well it works great but it does have an issue where the controller doesn't want to connect if the controller was turned off. The only way I've found to fix it is to restart the pc or to unplug the device and put it in a different port. The USB extender was a nice touch but theextender that comes with the steam controller is better because it can stand upright and is not just hanging around cluttering your space.
2326,3,"I purchased this game because I am a Bruce Lee fan. While playing this game, I find some features great, while others keeps me wanting for more. The fighting is okay, not impressive. There is not really good moves nothing too fancy. The sound and the cutscene are good and reminds you of old Bruce Lee movies. However, the game does not allow you to explore places to places. It leads you to a scene and you cannot walk or go where it does not allow you to. Have you ever played Power Rangers on SNES (Super Nintendo). This is somewhat like that game except the graphics are better and t here are more moves. Also, when you are ganged up sometimes, the controls are awkward because you have to switch target. Overall, this game is playable but still has room for improvement.
Gameplay: 7.5
Graphic:7.5
Story: 9
Replay: 7.0
Sound: 8.5
Overall: 7.9"
2327,3,"It's safe to say that Assassin's Creed 2 set the bar very high for this series - a great mix of creative storytelling, good writing and excellent parkour and combat mechanics made it a real knockout of a game. Unfortunately, Assassin's Creed 3 falls short in pretty much every department. It's not a bad game, and there are a few improvements and new features that really stand out as amazing additions - but the flaws are so significant that it's hard to actually recommend this game to anyone other than enthusiastic series fans.

The biggest flaw is definitely that the game feels woefully untested. AC3 on the PC has a ridiculous number of bugs, from epileptic horses to menu freezes that make it impossible to proceed, and I've been encountering them in virtually every mission and quite often while just running around. There are also a lot of bewildering things that somehow made it past playtesting; I was killing bears with a hidden blade that was apparently coming out of my bare arm for quite a while before the plot got around to letting me have it, and at one point I was wandering around and completely by accident captured a British Templar fort, which replaced the flag and all the troops there with American revolutionaries... in 1770. In-game tooltips display at very weird moments, like a prompt telling you how to lower your notoriety at a time in the game when none of the methods described are available to you, and every cinematic has a prompt saying ""PRESS E TO SKIP"" plastered across the corner for the duration. You're also given no explanation or instructions for huge swaths of key game concepts. It's not just software bugs, basically - this game feels like the PC port was never tested at all, and that the testing they did do was mostly from people who already knew the game really well.

That extends to the writing, too. The story improves considerably around the halfway point of the game, but the early levels are plagued with scenes that drag on way longer than necessary, a weird fixation on narration and having characters describe things instead of showing them to us, and extremely bad pacing. Skilled voice actors do their best with lines like ""what's true and what is aren't always the same,"" but there's just no saving a lot of these scenes, and the characters are mostly unlikable and uninteresting. We're given no reason to care about any of the characters until several missions into the game, and when we do finally meet our protagonist, our introduction to him is watching several scenes of mediocre voice actors monotone their way through extremely lengthy speeches in Mohawk. (I can't express how bad the Mohawk acting is, it's literally like hearing someone reading a technical manual.) The game is in serious need of an editor - things just move way too slowly, especially in dialogue and cinematics.

Gameplay itself isn't nearly so problematic, but still suffers badly from a lack of thorough testing. The developers made a big deal about the ability to pick up weapons on the fly, but I had trouble picking them up even standing completely still with no enemies around. The new lockpicking minigame is a perfect storm of unnecessary, no fun and unreasonably picky about precise mouse movement. I had problems constantly with getting stuck on the end of beams unable to move forward, having to realign to the precise right angle to climb certain objects, and attempting to climb impassable barriers that are completely indistinguishable from climbable surfaces. Combat is flashy (and extremely attractive), but is also reduced almost completely to a rock-paper-scissors game where each enemy requires one (and, barring exceptional circumstances, ONLY one) particular key combination to defeat. Several of the optional mission objectives are almost impossible to understand unless you've already played the level once. It's just rough, basically. The difficulty is a huge mess - I had no trouble taking on entire forts simultaneously from the very beginning of the game, but failed other missions constantly thanks to pointlessly capricious layouts for stealth sequences and unpredictable cutoff points for achieving secondary objectives. Even the historical hooks are almost completely ignored - aside from a few memorable (let's be fair, excellent) scenes like storming Bunker Hill, the actual history feels much more like a gimmick than an actual setting. One entire component of the game (the economic/crafting system) is only usable with an XBox controller and will freeze if you so much as move the mouse. A lot of the major components of the game feel like a rough draft, basically.

It's not all bad news, of course. The new naval sequences are outstanding, and the special dungeons (featuring several shipwreck levels and some cool Caribbean areas) are finely polished. The the antagonist finally starts directly interacting with the protagonist, their character interplay is by far the strongest part of the story, and both fun and engaging (although don't be surprised if you find yourself liking the antagonist considerably more than our hero). Graphically the game looks pretty great, and the new weather system is attractive (especially localized effects like fog). The nature areas look particularly good (and are massive!), which was a wise decision - colonial America was perhaps not the best choice for this series, considering its lack of gorgeous, huge landmark buildings to climb on, but the game seems to be making up for that by going for knockout natural environments instead. Although a lot of the previous installments' RPG elements are gone, the new hunting system is pretty engaging. Aside from lipsyncing and occasional clipping problems, animation is extremely high-quality across the board, especially in combat. The world is enormous, there's a ton of stuff to play around with and climb on. And I actually did find a couple (non-mandatory) minigames that were surprisingly fun, where you play old-timey board games in taverns. Some of the other details, like set decorations that only appear once or twice in the entire game, are clearly labors of love. There is some highly polished work in this game.

Overall, though, I'd only really recommend this game to people who are already in love with the series. I think it could have set new standards in a lot of ways, with some of the extraordinary detail work poured into the game - but with such major flaws, especially in such key parts of the game, a lot of the excellence in AC3 is totally overshadowed by the mediocrity. If you do buy it, though, stick with it - the game's flaws become much less glaring once you get through the opening third (around the time you get to visit the third game region, the enemies become significantly more varied, you have access to a much larger arsenal, the levels become less railroady, and the plot picks up considerably).

Pros:
-Excellent and exhilirating naval combat, action-cinematic levels and special dungeons
-Very attractive, if not revolutionary
-Pretty much anything you do out in the woods is great
-Combat is fun to watch
-The engine can support huge numbers of NPCs simultaneously (crowds are, well, crowded)
-It is still pretty fun, once you get past the slog of a first act

Cons:
-Mediocre story editing and script and very poor story pacing, especially in the first third of the game
-Mostly uninteresting characters
-Zero effort PC port
-Absolutely overrun with software bugs and continuity errors
-Combat is highly repetitive and often turns into infinite loops with guards spawning faster than you can kill or escape them
-Possibly the worst mandatory lockpicking minigame ever made (it's not nearly as bad with a controller, but it's maddening with a mouse, and purposeless either way)
-The setting is not well-suited to the more appealing gameplay elements
-There's a well-documented bug that completely prevents you from progressing past a certain point without an XBox controller, which wasn't fixed in the recent patches
-Way too much tedious waiting"
2328,3,"I was excited about getting this add-on. Boy, was I dissapointed to find out its a download only. I do not have XBox Live... The Leading Buy Title should say 'downloadable content only', but it didnt. It wasn't until I went back and read the fine print under its description, that it wasn't a 'disc'. So, buyer beware. Make sure you know what you're getting, before you buy."
2329,3,Doesn't connect like a controller. Seem to need line of sight. Why? No idea. Works fine when your pointing at the console. 3 stars.
2330,3,"For a great company like ID to be bought out by another even greater company must mean ID stopped caring about their multiplayer as it has gone down hill ever since Quake.  DOOM's multiplayer was amazing, Quake took it too the next level with full 3d movement, now days ID's games have terrible multiplayer and even crappy legacy destroying games like DOOM 3 ?, Quake 2, Quake 3, Quake 4 and Quake ET which sucked horribly, now we have a not so great, horrible multiplayer Wolfenstein game.....ID needs to play some classic DOOM & Quake to rediscover the awesomeness of online multiplayer.
Hopefully the new owner of ID can bring some respect back to these once awesome titles."
2331,3,"The graphics and sound are fine though they could be maybe more distinctive. Most wrestlers look the same.

The menus are very unintuitive. It is hard to figure out how to do things. This could have been made way easier. There's no on screen display to say hitting this button does this or that. That would have been helpful.

The name is true, you need to be a pro to play this. This is for gamers not video game fans. They could have just made the grapple have buttons display like with Naruto or DBZ games but instead you have to do some kind of timing thing which isn't even announced on screen when you do it right.

The game has some incredible features like the ability to speed it up and intricate control of the create a wrestler enemy AI. So it's not a bad game but it is just too hard. On the easiest difficulty setting I was being beat by the computer."
2332,3,No local play. Only play Xbox live gold acount
2333,3,"This was not a stellar game, But we liked it. A bit more lackluster on the content and could have been polished a bit more. If you see this on sale then it is worth it. We found it for Sub $20 and for that price it was worth it."
2334,3,"I thought it would be better but it aint, its not even close as good as THAWL"
2335,3,GOT A RESALE FORM OTHER USER.
2336,3,"So i came at this one without ever playing DS. I've heard good things. Thought i'd try it out.

Really wanted to like this one. I've had friends rave about it and so i finally picked it up. I've only been able to sink an hour or two in a night and it's been fun, but the game just feels flat. It's clearly meant to be a trial and error game. You cant brute force anything (though arguably you can just run past most mobs), boss fights are tough, and you die a ton. What bugs me is everything is so formulaic. Each enemy has one or two main attacks. All you're doing as the player is memorizing the correct sequence for each monster. This is where the game loses me though. The combat gets dull fast. It's hard, but that doesn't make it good. You can do some interesting visceral attacks and the jump attack can be useful, but otherwise, it's still hack, slash, and roll for most battles. This gets old fast. The majority of the fights are easy, but when you're dying so much, they get repetitive and boring. The checkpoints are far too spaced out and you spend a great deal of time learning the path for each little gauntlet. I guess my problem with the game is it seems to be trying to hide it's lack of depth by just making the game hard. You spend a lot of time playing, but there really isn't a ton of content. The world may be pretty, but the talking doors, dead ends, and fighting the same fight for the tenth time really take away from enjoying the game.
I get that the game has a huge fan-base that has some masochistic obsession with it, but to an outsider, an intense difficulty like this seems to take away heavily from the actual lore of the game. You rarely get to sit back and enjoy much because you're too busy killing the same netherbeast for the tenth time only to die shortly after again fighting the first boss. Dying wouldn't be terrible if you didn't basically restart from the beginning each death or if it didn't take almost a minute to load every time you die, and you die alot.
I guess it just feels like a holdover from 90's era gaming where games were brutal, the story was fairly simple and short, but you spent most of your time, trying through trial and error, to figure out how to move on. Part of the beauty of gaming nowadays is how adaptive it has become. Hardcore gamers can be challenged and those that play for the story, can run through to enjoy. Bloodborne seems to be hiding what it lacks behind its difficulty, and what makes the game difficult is its clunky, repetitive, combat where you can easily get stuck on a rock and somehow roll in place when trying to dodge. I cant count how many times i've locked onto a boss only to roll and have my camera stuck behind part of the environment.
Now onto why the game is still fun. The game is really, really simple. Once you get everything figured out, you pretty much just get into a rhythm of things, and that's what can make the game interesting. The beginning is painfully brutal, but you catch on, and you start to die less, though still pretty often. If you can find a way to enjoy the repetition, you're set. Otherwise, it gets really old. The visuals are pretty solid and the world is beautiful, though i'm amazed at how many times I've watched a hound ghost itself inside of a fence, or run on the air, but otherwise, most of the creature animations are fluid.
The boss fights are painfully slow. Each fight is lasting me about ten minutes or under when i actually win. Co-op makes these fights go faster but the bosses don't seem to adapt very well to the players. If one guy hits hard and draws aggro, the boss will just ignore the guy right next to him hacking at its legs. You can beat the cleric beast simply by hitting it in a circle and it'll spend all its time trying to decide who to hit. I also wish the co-op wasn't built in as a crutch, but rather as something you could play as just another mode. I'd love to play this game with a couple of friends, running through the game regularly. But once again this comes back to the game just being pretty simple and straightforward.
There also seems to be many problems with the co-op. I have to use 3-4 insight to actually get someone to join because i lose connection instantly half the time i use the bell. This is a major pain because you lose 3-4 insight for every one summon.

I guess the point is the game can be enjoyable, but you really have to convince yourself to enjoy it. You'll figure it out within the first few hours if its for you or not. I'd recommend trying a friend's copy before buying it. The difficulty is just part of the game, but once you get used to it, you start to see that underneath everything, the game-play is pretty basic. I really wish there was more to do other than just keep slashing through the same path so i can try to fight the same battle again and hopefully not lose this time by dodging back instead of right.
In the end, it's worth trying and and a good game, though not great.

update: 45 hours in. Still not loving the game. It can be fun but most of it is just repetitive. I'm not sure who really enjoys fighting the same fights a dozen times, but it's not for me. The game itself is beautiful and there's tons to find if you search. It gets really grindy at times. When i unlock a new weapon set or armor set in the store, it means i'm going to have to go farm the same fights twenty times to save up so i can buy the next tier. PvP is exciting though, but can be annoying since you cant disable it when you just want to play the game. Really wish the game had some kind of save or pause feature since sometimes i may only have an hour after work to play the game and that might not get me to another lantern. It's a game for diehard fans, it seems or people who have tons of free time to play games. It's fun at times, but it still just feels like it's trying too hard to just be a difficult game with pointless complexities like no save points and clunky combat. It's not great, but it's not terrible. There are plenty of people that love it and plenty more that will love it, but from what i've seen, the game gets repetitive fast and stays that way for a long time. If you like repetition, go for it. I don't see what the thrill of fighting the same fights dozens of times is. It's still fun to run through and try to get far, but it gets old and the game seems to hide what it lacks (a story or fluid PvE combat, meaningful fights instead of mostly grinding) behind its difficulty and what's really sad is the game itself isn't truly difficult. It's really pretty simple. You just memorize which guys to parry and which to rush and which to roll past. It's not adaptive combat except in PvP. It's hard because the combat is clunky (if you fight without lock-on for groups, you'll often get your camera stuck behind walls). It's hard like the original super mario - the game itself is simple, but you learn how to progress through endless deaths and trial and error."
2337,3,It's good when it works. I have 15 more words I have to say before I can submit it and I don't know what eles I have to say about it
2338,3,"I bought this game for all the wrong reasons. I bought this game expecting a remastered combined version of Battlefront and Battlefront 2 from the original xbox. I will keep this short and simple, the graphics are astonishing, ""if you want another Call of Duty game"", well this is pretty much Call of Duty without a storyline campaign to go along  with it and of couse yout have Rebles and Storn Troopers instead of Marines and Terrorist. This game was ""made"" for online only, (it has single player), so if your a campaign seeker this game is not for you. This game lacks so much greatness from what the other two battlefronts for the original XBOX set the stakes so high for. I have a feeling that this is only the first game but I consider this a bigger let down to me than Halo 5. I don't think I waste 70 bucks, I just feel like I paid for a game that I got half of what I wanted.

It might just be me but I don't find this game as appealing. I need something a little more considering this series is bigger than Halo or Resident Evil to me."
2339,3,"Hitman Contracts follows the same line of play as Hitman 2.  Your mission, each level, essentially is to assassinate a character.
The game follows essentially a linear path: begin at a start point, and work your way though to the objective.  There is usually more than one way to kill, and you can complete your objectives in any order.
You have to pay close attention to what you're doing in this game.  You can change clothes and disguise yourself, for example, as a waiter, but if you get frisked, the guards will be alerted if you're carrying weapons or if you're in a place where waiters usually don't tred.  You can also drag and hide bodies.  At the end of each level, you're receive a rating for your stealth.
The graphics in this game are par: it's obvious it was made for several platforms, and it doesn't have great graphics like an x-box game really should.  The cutscenes, however, are quite nice.
Overall, this game should hold your interest for a while.  It's challenging, but often monotonous."
2340,3,"Coming into this game I knew that it was a dungeon crawler similar to Orcs and Elves and that it was played from a first-person perspective.  Having enjoyed Orcs and Elves immensely, I was hoping to have a great experience with this game as well.  I was not too disappointed.

The first hour or so of gameplay had me forming a party of three, equipping them with the best weapons and armor I could find and making my way through an ok story by traversing through dungeons that unfolded on my map as I progressed.  This would alternate with being outside of dungeons on a world map where I would interact with different villagers, getting quests and unlocking areas with which to proceed in the game.

I loved leveling up my characters by killing different creatures in the dungeons to find loot that I could keep or sell to merchants in the villages.  Assigning my party members skill points in the areas I wanted them to excel in was also a good deal of fun.  The graphics, while dated, were adequate in displaying the different types of creatures and characters I discovered.

After several hours of gameplay, I had discovered my only two real complaints.  First, it would have been great to have a better mini-map of the dungeons.  I constantly had to alternate between pressing the select button to bring up my map"
2341,3,"Packaging for the Joystick looked great, nicer than I expected.  Came with drivers (that I haven't looked at yet).  Worked right away in a PSX to USB adapter on my PC.  My adapter has two PSX ports so I didn't want to take up another USB port on my PC just to use it.  Works great on the adapter.

Joystick feels right, not too loud, pretty good arcade quality response/feel.  Buttons are well placed, joystick was really smooth.

I didn't want to give this more than three stars because my joystick game with a 1/2 bubble on the face decal (which is matte black so it sticks out like a sore thumb).  I don't want to go through the hassle of an exchange, so I guess I'll live with it but it is a nuisance.

Finally - the same matte black decal is just a fingerprint magnet.  It's tough to keep clean."
2342,3,"I hate how Ace Combat changed itself in this game. I loved 4, 5, and 0, but this game feels like they've lost the focus on gameplay and are trying to wow you with gimmicks."
2343,3,"As one of my most anticipated titles of the year, I must say that I am a huge fan of the stable of characters being presented in this release. Sega, Capcom and Namco have some of the most iconic characters in all of gaming, and seeing them presented in such beautiful detail is not only a dream come true, but most likely a once in a lifetime event. Having plugged in 20 hours into the game, let me get the bad news out of the way first;
1. It is extremely repetitive. There is rarely any ""skill"" required to battle, and one only needs to remember when to press a specific combination of buttons in order to achieve the most damage.
2. The story makes very little sense: After the 12th conversation where I still did not understand why anything was happened, or what was going on, I just started skipping the dialogue in favor of the battles.

Now, on to the good news;
1. Ultimate fan service: this is the game only a fan can appreciate. If you have a favorite character, be it from Sega, Capcom or Namco, they are given a great amount of attention.
2. The game is beautiful: the sprite work is amazing, and every character is rendered in exquisite detail. The animation interspersed between the battle animations is also a great touch.
3. The battles are fun: I actually replayed several battles, and it was fun to try new combinations or characters and moves.
4. Lengthy quest; The game is LONG. I am 20 hours in, and I still have plenty more to do. You certainly get your money's worth.

I am giving this game 3 stars simply because if you are not a fan of the respective companies, you will find little to keep you playing. But as a huge fan of Sega and Capcom, seeing some of my favorite characters brought back to their 2D, sprite-based glory left me grinning from ear to ear. I love the aesthetics of this game, and it is perfect as a portable game. If you are on the fence as to whether to dive into this game, think about how much you love the respective companies. If your answer is ""not very"", then look elsewhere. If, however, you happen to have a favorite franchise amongst the 50+ characters presented, you will love watching them battle, and isn't that enough?"
2344,3,"If you're looking for an Xbox One audio adapter for the controller (v1), there are a couple of options.  I have both versions of the Turtle Beach adapters: Original and Plus.  I'll be comparing the two below.

UNBOXING: The Ear Force Plus comes in a small 4 x 3 x 1"" box.  It has a plastic insert that holds both a very short (~9"") micro-usb cord, the adapter, and some Turtle Beach instructions.  The adapter is 3 x 1 x .75"".  Overall the boxing is secure and minimal.  However, it's substantially larger than the original's box (3.5 x 2 x 1"").  The original only came with the adapter and the instructions.

REVIEW: Sound quality in the Pro vs the Original is indistinguishable for me.  The Pro claims it has the Superhuman Hearing Mode (you can toggle it from the upper middle button, and it lights up when in use), which when activated makes everything louder, but no more clear than the original.  Turning up the volume on the Original version seemed to make the same changes in audio as the Pro.  The form factor on the Pro is almost exactly the same as the original, but appears to be more rounded and ""fat"" due to the lines compared to the Original.  I like the Pro having a rubberized touch to the buttons, compared to the plastic ones in the Original.  The Pro also has two extra buttons on the bottom, the mic preset and game preset.  These are nice if you are that picky about what game has which presets.  However, I didn't hear much of a difference when using the presets than not, and people at the other end of the game didn't say a thing about audio quality as I switched between them.  One nice quality of the Pro is that the mute button doubles as a mic monitor (from low to high reception).  That is not in the original.

OVERALL: If you don't have an audio adapter, this is a good one to have.  The extra buttons and capabilities may actually be distinguishable to you to make you pay the extra $15 investment for it.  However, I found that I really didn't go for the Pro when the Original was already in the controller.  Usually, I only noticed when I had to switch the adapters out after recharging the controller."
2345,3,"When this came out, I was so excited. I'm sure most of the gaming community will agree when I say that Fallout 3 was one of the best games ever. So when this was coming out, I couldn't wait for it. My friend at work and I would talk and ask ourselves, ""How can they make the sequel as good, or better than Fallout 3? It was such a great game?"" Well, to answer that question, they didn't. Fallout 3 had a sense of mystery and such a unique storyline that this game is more of the same, but with a story that is not as interesting as Fallout 3. There are interesting moments to be sure, I especially liked the one with Boone, but on the whole, the sense of wonder was no longer there. Coming out of the vault in Fallout 3, seeing the world for the first time was really amazing. Here, we know all about the wasteland already. I felt that this story ran in conjunction with 3, but it just took place on the west coast. What I did like better was having a small team join you. One mercenary and one robot. These guys REALLY helped when you had to fight some really tough enemies. The biggest changes was that Karma had no effct on the game. Instead it's reputation. Unlike 3, where you had a clear mission to find your father, New Vegas gaves you many options in terms of how you want to complete the game. My friends at work had vastly different games than myself, which I think is really cool. But in 3, you didn't have the options to choose sides, this one you can. I sided with the NCR, while my co worker stayed neutral. This brought out completely different quests for both of us. So, I imagine the replayabiity is good. I have yet to play it again though to test this theory. The game initially played fine with minor glitches. The one patch I downloaded didn't really do much to alleviate this problem. I certainly didn't have as much problems as my fellow gamers have stated until the end. Then it kept freezing up and starting over all by itself. Frustrating to say the least. Graphically, it's clear that they are using the same graphics engine as 3. One would have thought they would have used a new one. This didn't bother me since the game looks great. I must give high marks for the designers on their choice of music. As an avid music collector, I was surprised by the number of RARE jazz recordings they have selected. I realize that to hard core gamers, they probably could care less, but as a music lover, I was astonished by the selections. For example, the Peggy Lee song ""Why Don't you Do Right?"" is a well known song by her. Both her original with Benny Goodman in 1942 and her remake from 1947. So to my astonishment, the designers went with the RAREST version. Her transcription version for Capitol, which arguably is her best one. Then to keep up with the rarities, they chose another transcription from Bing Crosby. This track, ""Something's Gotta Give"" was only just reissued on a limited edition set from Mosaic records. Then the cut from Helen Forest, ""Mad About The Boy"" is yet another transcription recording. So I was really impressed by their selection of rare jazz recordings. Now of course, they went with some famous standards from Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole. How can it be Las Vegas without those three guys? And chose famous songs by them that are readily available on CD. In case no one else mentions it, a lot of the quests are named after famous Sinatra songs, One For My Baby, Ring-A-Ding Ding, That Lucky Old Sun. So to give the gamers out there more appreciation for this game, they made sure that the titles of the quests were steeped in Sinatra/Vegas lore. Not all of them, but a lot of them. So this cool little fact may be lost on some gamers. I know my friends, save one, didn't know the Sinatra connection. The game has fun missions and a lot of familiar characters are here again. The game is long, at least the way I played it. I found that my friends eschewed a lot of the missions to complete the game. But a lot of those missions you won't be able to do, depending on who side with. Unless, you play both sides of the fence of course. I had to live with the glitches but unfortunately, one of those glitches kept me from completing a quest. When I had originally played this quest, I completed it. But again due a glitch, I had to go back several steps before I completed it. So when I got back to this point, the game refused to go on (it was a movie sequence where you had to wait for the characters to complete their parts) and it was just stuck there. Fortunately it wasn't vital to the game, but it just sucked that I was at the end and I couldn't complete it. On the whole, I found it entertaining, but my friends started to get tired of it since the game play didn't differ from 3. If they put out a sequel to this game, I hope that the bugs are worked out and they come up with a more engaging story. The story wasn't bad, but it just didn't have the same sense of awe that 3 had. This one you have find out who killed you and discover the secret behind the platinum chip. It's interesting, but not as gripping as 3. So if you played 3, then you will enjoy this, but be prepared for all the glitches. That really hinders the game play especially in key parts. You might want to just borrow it from a friend or rent it just to be safe."
2346,3,"Es la primera vez que juego un no more heroes y realmente me siento decepcionado, es realmente frustrante tratar de hacer los combos y estar cargando  el sable a cada rato, pens que la jugabilidad era como la de los juegos de star wars pero es mas tedioso. El tema tampoco es nada del otro mundo.
  En resumen nada del otro mundo pasable para jugar un rato, pero realmente esta muy lejos de ser una obra maestra"
2347,3,"Have played better pc games. This game can get pretty boring really quick.  It's nothing special, but it's not bad either."
2348,3,Works good but the label is messed up and there was no manuel.
2349,3,"This game is OK, like if I did live back in the 80s I might of given this game a better review since when I play games I like them to be realy special. There were some flaws in this game like you can only buy one potion at once and to save you have to kill yourself like when I have to do something else I have to like get some enimies to kill me. But there were some good things about this game, like for its time and now the world map was big with alot to explore and dungens to explore. I think Ganon was way to easy though but hey this was an 80s game so it was about what you could expect. I would recomend renting this game."
2350,3,"I tried to play the game multiple times, but Dark Souls 1,2, & 3 have spoiled me. Plus the fact that there aren't any items that can refill HP and can be refilled at bonfires really killed it for me."
2351,3,"Before I get started this game is OK, just OK. The game starts off where you play as some guy who comes to this island for...I don't know or care. So you talk to dumb friends who talk about nothing all day. Then you fall asleep and you wake up and your friends are gone, and now the game gets started. The game's graphics are bad. The monsters look bad as well but that is not the worst part. The back grounds are God awful. It looks like a guy threw up on the game. The controlls are on and off. Some times the game is fun if you play it long enough. If you like B-Movie games you will like this game. I give this game a 3 outa 5. I recommend that you should just rent this game."
2352,3,"I have big hands so my fingers always extend over the end of the mouse. Not usually a problem but for some reason they made the right side of this mouse curve out at the end, so it gets very wide and the RMB goes all the way out to the edge. So where am I supposed to put my ring finger? It either drags against the mat or rubs against the sharp corner of the mouse button and gets pinched when I right click. And either way it doesn't get much grip because it is a straight finger lying across a concave shape.

Maybe they intended it to rest on the right click as well, but having two fingers on one button feels very unnatural, causes me to accidentally click, and severely reduces the grip which is already a problem because the plastic is very slick and the only grip comes from 2 tiny rubber strips on either side. For contrast my Zowie ec1 has no rubber grips but the entire plastic shell is grippy. Its also very smooth and comfy with rounded edges.

I had to return this Deathadder. Disappointing because it seems to be a high quality mouse otherwise. Braided cord, good clicks, and best wheel I've ever had (all areas where my Zowie is severely lacking)."
2353,3,"when your opponent does a substitution jutsu and gets behind your character doesnt turn around, when you use your substitution jutsu it takes away from the super gauge and you have to build it up again, and your button bashing a single button to do combos, i wish there were more options to attack with who ever created this does not know how to make a fighting game well the concept is there he didn't get it rite there are better options than this on the playstation why didn't he review other great fighting games before creating this junk"
2354,3,"Some of the games we had played at fairs,but some were hard to figure out. Still had lots of fun with."
2355,3,I see the idea they were aiming for.. Role playing strategy in an FPS but the lack of content and reason to play made me completely forget about this game after a few weeks.
2356,3,"Okay...now I'm not a fan of Mega Man, and I have only played this Mega Man, which I recieved as a Christmas present 2 years ago. I recently put this up on a rummage sale for $7 after playing it about 4 times. (In two years!) Well, I just took it off, because i figured out, they are paying mad prices for it on ... so im gonna sell mine there for about $30. Anyways, I played this 4 times....out of the two years I've had it, and my 4th time was the day before the rummage (which was two days ago)...my advice is that if you like cartoons, then this is for you. Nothing but cartoon humor, cartoon mischief, cartoon talking, cartoon bubbles...THE WHOLE GAME IS A CARTOON! I guess if you have liked MM for awhile, MM8 would be good for you, but not for the average gamer. If I had to rate this at an age scale, I would say it is from ages 6-10. My lil step bro likes it, and he begged me to play it and he did, (even though he totally ... as it)...i watched him play it, and it was a cartoon. The only cool part was the TV-like anime at the beginning. I have the Collectors Edition, and there are only 10,000 ever pressed. I collect things, but this, I must say, even though there is a limited number, and they are no longer making this, ...I have to sell it. I won't ever play it, and I wouldnt ever spend the money to put this in a plaque cuz it just isn't worth the money.
So, to wrap it up...If you've liked Mega Man, or you're intrested in the Mega Man legacy...or, for that matter, if you like cartoons, then this is for you...and yes, agreeing with one person that said this earlier...Mega Man sounds like his little sister."
2357,3,"Its not even that it's a bad game the storyline is fine and the graphics are great but speaking for myself I couldn't help but compare it to better space combat games of the past.  Elite Plus, Protostar, The XWING series and the Wing Commander Series created games 15 years ago that make more recent additions like Dark Star, X3, and Freelancer look like they were designed by bumbling armatures uninspired is the correct term.  This is not the fault of the individual games its just a testament to the changing face of PC gaming (what's left of it)

Like most of the modern games everything comes to fast and to easy sucking all the fun out of what could have been a great game."
2358,3,"IMO, An Alright Game"
2359,3,Great sound but build quality is an issue.  I have had two break at the head band and the latest pair came with a lose right side panel.
2360,3,"This games is ok i am not loving it as much as Disney Infinity 3.0. It takes 5 to 8 hours to download plus you have to put the portal together which is kind of fun, but gets old after a while. I bought all of the Lord of the rings characters, Back to the Future, Wonderwoman, the Jurrasic World and The Wicked Whitch of the West and I don't think I will buying much more, even though I was excited about Doctor who. Everything about this games is expensive, though I did know that a head of time I preordered it. Great concept, but just ok game. I thought I would like it since I like Lego games."
2361,3,"I got this stick so that I could check out the hat switch.

I had two motives, two goals.

I  have a very good friend (my son), who just joined up, and I thought if I could pass on some knowledge (I've been flying the Comanche 4 for YEARS in sim. My son might need to hop on a Comanche in an emergency, and I want him to know how already. Same with the F-16 and the Abrams.

I also wanted to ""play around with something close to the real.""

 I found the hat switch very stiff. If it is made to work realistically, I'd suggest a little less realism, a little more easy to use.

 It works, and it certainly moves, but this is not a kid's joystick.

 It's QUITE stiff.

  The other thing I found was what I'll call ""slip"". In certain ""sweet spots"", the action failed completely. I ran it through a dozen simulations, and when I pushed a HARD left (port), roughly 1/2 way into a HARD bank to port in the F-16, I was flying either straight ahead, or I was doing a 1/4 turn. In combat, this would get me killed.

  Sorry, Logitech. In most cases, I'm your biggest fan. But unless I'm missing something, this one's a miss."
2362,3,"This is honestly a good game but it was too overwhelming for my taste. As a fan of Dragon Age 2, I felt like they added a lot of pointless side quests that didn't have any meaning other than to waste my time. The gear system was increased in complexity and the combat camera and management was more cumbersome as well. They made the learning curve too deep in my opinion. They went a little overboard with the scope for this game. There is a ton of gameplay to be had in this game, but much of it feels meaningless rather than entertaining, in my opinion. If you enjoy backtracking and repeating a lot of meaningless tasks, this is the game for you.

If they had cut the fat off this game and just kept the more interesting parts, I think it would be a more enjoyable experience."
2363,3,"This mouse isn't what I hoped it would be. The ""hardware"" part of the mouse works great and I love the buttons on the side. However, the software doesn't work at all. After I installed the software, the mouse is constantly kicked back into ""default"" mode, effectively erasing all personalization that I have set up. This, as you can imagine, is super frustrating. I tried uninstalling the software and using it that way, but there are no ""forward"" or ""back"" buttons set up by default, so it simply does not work for how I want to use it. Disappointed with this mouse, especially the software. :("
2364,3,"I really didn't get to play this too much. The graphics and special effects are gorgeous to look at, but the way consoles are nowadays with double analog controls, four top buttons, four action buttons, analog control sticks acting as buttons and modern developers' need to assign an individual function to each and every one, it's just about impossible to enjoy a game anymore, and this one is no exception.

With too much to remember, and too much to go wrong fumbling about with the controller, being an armchair quarterback seems to have become about as much work as being a real one. Personally, I just can't get into this game enough to enjoy it."
2365,3,"Wasn't sure what to expect, after only a hour of game play, I am kinda lost for words. Graphics are good, but need additional time to get use to the controller functions. Will provide a update, when I have more time to play the game."
2366,3,"ADDED AFTER POSTING:  For some reason, they have removed the prices from my review.  They were ALL LIST PRICES, that anyone can look up and without them, the review is stupid.  Let me try this.  If you purchase a Wii off the shelf, it will cost you 52% more for GHWT with an extra guitar (for the full 4 instrument experience) than RB2 with an extra guitar.  If the percentage is removed from this, then just go ahead and delete the whole review.  Talk about censorship!

I know there is a heated argument about GH vs RB, but the way that Activision has chosen to RIP OFF Wii users makes the Wii decision SIMPLE AND FINAL.
If you buy a Wii, you will probably want a second Wii remote, but even if you don't buy one, you can get Rockband 1 or 2 and play the WHOLE game.  It only requires ONE Wii remote to play with a microphone, guitar and drums and if you get another guitar, you can add a bass guitar.
If you buy GH World Tour for the Wii you will need to purchase two additional Wii remotes in order to play with 3 instruments and you will need to buy a 4th Wii Remote to play with two guitars.
The fact that they decided to set the game up this way is not quite so bad.  The problem is that the list price is the SAME as PS3 and Xbox360 versions.
Both RB and GH require ONE remote for the microphone, but GH requires another remote for each additional instrument.  I wonder how hard Activision was laughing when they figured out how much money they would save on the wireless controller components that are built in on the RB1 and RB2 guitar and ALSO on the RB2 drums.
DO NOT try to blame this on the Wii.  Rockband 1&2 has provided these controller components for their Wii version built into the guitars and drums (and yes, even the RB1 drums have a controller built in, it is just not wireless).
Bottom line on this (I will use list prices here):
Wii game comes with one controller. After that, in order to play RB1 or RB2 with all 4 instruments, it will cost you the following:
RB1 special edition PLUS additional guitar - $[...] (I do not recommend buying any of the RB1 stuff at this point though because the RB2 stuff is almost the same price)
RB2 special edition PLUS additional guitar - $[...]

To play GHWT with all 4 instruments on a standard Wii, you will need to spend $[...] PLUS $[...] for 3 additional Wii remotes totaling $[...].

$[...] to do the same thing that you can do with RB2 for $[...], yet they charge the same for the game and extra guitar controller as they do for the ones they make for Xbox360 and PS3.

I ordered GHWT for the Wii and have not received it yet, and I may actually keep it, even though I will need to spend AT LEAST $[...] for one additional remote (I have 2 already) just to play the whole game, but if I am not happy with it for any reason, I am going to return it to ACTIVISION on the grounds of FALSE advertising.  It says the exact same thing on the outside of the Wii box as it does on the Xbox360 and PS3 boxes.
One Wireless Guitar controller
One Wireless Drum controller

THESE ARE NOT WIRELESS CONTROLLERS.  THEY ARE JUST GUITAR AND DRUM SHELLS THAT ACCEPT THE Wii WIRELESS REMOTE!!!!

GHWT supporters - defend that!"
2367,3,"I got this game as a gift and really enjoyed it, at least the first half or so.  It's got some really good voice acting and a compelling plot, assuming you have some idea what Warhammer is about.  In terms of game play, it is very much like a poor man's Halo.  The graphics are serviceable, if a tad weak.  The game play is fast paced in the beginning, but slows down later on when you fight one or two strong enemies instead of waves of weaker ones.  The game is a bit too realistic at this point, making the weapons that have the stopping power you need fire very slowly.  It makes a lot of fights just a matter of firing off a shot, stepping to the side, firing another, stepping back, firing again, repeat, repeat, and repeat.  You can only save at the end of each level, though you do get checkpoints in level.

The enemy AI is a bit on the weak side at times, which isn't always a bad thing.  As difficult as it is to control a FPS on a console, the game would possibly be too hard with smarter enemies.  Still, having them stand in a corner and do nothing while you snipe them from just outside the range that triggers them is a tad lame.

Remember, I mentioned liking it for the first half or so?  Well, that is due in part to the arrival of the final enemy models, who have the distinctly annoying ability to teleport in directly in front of you, firing their weapon at point blank range.  It makes the last half of the game an exercise in memorizing where the last guy to blindside you warped in so you can usually trigger him, back off, and blast him.  Sometimes it doesn't work and you're just taking cheap hits.

Another cheap move is portals that form to block doors.  They don't just stop your progress, touching one is instant death.  If that weren't annoying enough, they appear over doors sometimes with almost no notice.  You can just be walking forward in the game, suddenly a portal covers where you're walking and you die instantly.  It's even more fun trying to judge when the portal has dissipated enough for you to pass.  You can either wait a long time for it to clear completely, or hope that it's not still deadly.  I'm all for a long, difficult game, but artificially padding it by using extremely cheap tactics and checkpoints that make you wait minutes for events to happen before you can move on is not fun, just frustrating.

The real thing that dooms this game is the glitches.  I've never seen this many glitches in anything but an online PC game.  If you're going to make long levels with few checkpoints, it is wholly unacceptable to repeatedly get stuck in walls, behind things, or get killed because a level requires near perfect performance, but also fails to register multiple direct hits on an enemy (animated, but no damage).  What's more, if you do need to restart a level you have to do it from all the way at the beginning, you cannot restart from a checkpoint unless you die.  This all adds up to a lot of wasted time unfairly being forced to replay the same level over and over again.  Wicked awesome!

Despite its faults, this really is a pretty fun game.  If it had better play testing before its release this would be a real winner.  As it is, it avoids being bad, but crawls in somewhere slightly above mediocre."
2368,3,"If you're the type of gamer that's willing to put up with bugs and wait for a patch before you really get to dig into some fantastic gameplay, Sims2 will do you right well.

TS2 is gorgeous in its execution. It's graphically quite sound, and the gameplay is fast and subtle. It's also quite buggy in the long term. There are essentially two different modes: Build mode and Live mode.

In Live mode, you live your Sims' lives, controlling any aspect you want. There's also an option to allow ""free will,"" so sims will do things even when you're not directly controlling them. As their creator, you're tasked with keeping them happy through fun, social encounters, eating, and bathing, amongst other things. You're also called upon to balance their long-term needs. New to The Sims 2 are Aspirations, what your Sim wants to accomplish in life. You can choose from Popularity, Romance, Family, Knowledge, and Wealth.

Build mode is what happens when the game is paused. In build mode, you construct houses, buy furniture and do landscaping. It's the construction set phase of the game where you can just let your imagination take control.

Live mode is the buggy one. Some people report playing the game just fine, no problems. Others, especially those who remain dedicated to one family or set of sims for a long period of time, report game-stopping bugs.

Build mode, fortunately, works just fine, and many Simmers (myself included) are having a lot of fun designing houses, sims, and clothes for them, even writing stories and tutorials to share on EA's own site.

EA and Maxis have done a wonderful job of creating a community center where everyone who registers the game can share custom content with each other. If you can wait until the first patch for live mode, there's still a lot of fun to be had in build mode.

I will be updating this review as the game is patched to reflect the current state of the game.

Update!

I've patched the game with the only available patch, and I can say that all of the problems I had were gone. If you were waiting, you can stop now!"
2369,3,"Well, it works. But the print is very, very light and hard to read. Also the paper just doesn't feel right."
2370,3,"Only noticeable difference is more vivid colors, other than that, no change from using the progressive cables"
2371,3,"Another Mario game, which actullay turns out to be quite enjoyable. there's something new about this, something that's normally in a Mario game, there are flaws. In almost every subject that I'm about to write about, which is sad.

Graphics: 9/10
Pros:
It's amazing how good the grahics are, very smoothed out, with lots of textures. I tell you, I've never seen a game so colorful, so bright. Almost everything is pretty well detailed.
Cons:
All the colors are great and fun in a Mario game, but there's just too much of that in this. It really bothers my eyes sometimes. I'm confused here, why is Yoshi all diferent. What's going on with Orange, Purple, Yellow, Pink?!?!? What happend to Green? It's really stupid, just because you gobble a banana, dosn't mean your going to turn that color.

Sound: 7/10
Pros:
Very well done in this game, I enjoy lishening to it. Backround music is enjoyable. A new small feature they added, is when Mario is weak and low on health, his voice will get quieter and weaker, a neat little feature.
Cons:
Mario's voice will bug you like crazy. When your bellyhopping, the ""hah"" noise is very distrating and annoying that I could round kick him in the throat so he couldn't say anything. The most downright annoying thing in this game, are the island fatties. When you talk to them, instead of giving you advise, they might say something like ""Oh, I love the sunset tonight,"".

Gameplay: 5/10
 Sometimes I'll get a speed nozzle, spray the fatso's in the pants then I'll flee, with the speed nozzle, that's how annoying they are, you know, I think that the designers of this game ran out of ideas very quickly, because Mario's mission is to collect all the shine sprites (what happend to stars?). 20 of these sprites are in the hands of these fools on the island. It's really ridiculous. The levels are downright terrible, and you can only go for 1 shine at a time, were in SM64, you could get for 4 stars if you felt like it. It's rare that you'll be stomping anything, and the only point in doing so is to collect coins for health. Another thing about the levels, their all the same, nothing's defferent about any of them. SM64 we got volcano, desert, water worlds and SMS, we have paradise, that's it. Oh, there's a park of paradise, and a hotel of paradise, forgot to tell you that.

Secrets/Unlockables: 6/10
They put alot of this stuff in this game, 1/3 of the sprites are Secret. One thing I hate about this game, the blue coins. First off, it seems pretty neat, but when you discover that you need to get blue coins to help collect every single sprite, this turns into a hassle. Enough about all the bad stuff, let's talk about the nozzles. There are 3 types, a hover (makes you hover in air for a few seconds), a rocket (you can soar high in the air) and a speed nozzle (you can go 5x faster then you normally run). This gave the game some taste. The rocket nozzle helped me unlock 3 hidden sprites (which is actullay pretty good) and the speed got me about 7 hidden shines.

Contorls: 8/10
I don't know why people find the controls slopply, I say it works out well, very easy to learn too. Aiming the spray nozzle is tricky like 1 star people said, but it just takes a little practice to get good at it. The camera controls are very disrupting, sure you can move the camera, but if your in a certain spot, the camera won't move a notch.

Overall:6.5/10
The game is very enjoyable, but they changed the story a little to much to call it a Mario game."
2372,3,"wasnt great, but wasn't horrible. this game is for hardcore seekers lol."
2373,3,"Mario Party 5 is a great game and is definately worth purchasing if you do not have a Mario Party game for your Gamecube.  If you have Mario Party 4, though, you might want to reconsider purchasing this game.  The maps are nothing extraordinarily different and brand-new mini-games are few and far between.  Maybe Nintendo should have delayed the game a year or two in order to make this game more different than Mario Party 4.
Another thing that irks me is that it seems like the computer cheats with the CPU characters.  For example, it too-often places the next star location directly in front of the CPU player.
Of course, where Mario Party games really shine are at 4-player Nintendo parties.  If you are a hardcore Mario Partier, then this game may be just what you are looking for."
2374,3,You are sherlock  Holmes..  puzzle  are to hard to do and salve them.  Find who did the murderers is fun. game to  short.  wait for  price  $35 to 45.  1 of  6 case done.  it  like pace of episode  of walking  dead . double  the cost.  $10 a episode .
2375,3,"In attempt to reinvent itself, God of War returns as a much more story driven cinematic game. Leaving behind the fast and crazy fighting of the past, God of War flops on levels that most reviewers won't acknowledge.

First- the game looks great! It is a graphical achievement for the PS4 but unfortunately still sees some frame rate issues on the PS4 Pro. The level of detail on characters and in the environment is amazing, so hats off for that.

The story is ok as it is just another journey that seems small but has a lot of struggles along the way. During the story you do see your two main characters grow and bond, which is nice.

Now for combat- This is probably the worst part for me. The over the shoulder camera is not meant for combat at all, and it's ridiculous. Your actions feel slow and weak, and some monsters do substantial amounts of damage in little cheap shots. Out of my 12 hours of play time I've maybe died 5 times, which isn't bad, but the fighting is just not fun at all, or more like a love hate, as in it is fun sometimes, but most times not.

Character cuatomization is simple and easy to understand, just be sure to loot as much as possible as upgrades and gear can get pricey at first.

I would recommend this game to some who values graphics and adventure over combat and fluidity."
2376,3,"The combat still feels the same- slower paced and after playing games like Bayonetta, GoWIII feels extremely sluggish. The extra weapons are yet again pointless, the story takes a dive midway though and isn't really all that great overall, and the ending was...not much of a conclusion like i was expecting this ""epic trilogy"" to end.

Kratos voice acting doesnt sound believable in this game at all; He shouts out quite a few one liners that really aren't needed or don't make much sense. The actress that voiced Athena in GoWII has been recast with a very generic sounding woman. Theres also a ""sex scene"" minigame which was obvious the developers put it in just to do so, (I suppose because the first two games had it, so why break the trend), which was lame.

I was also expecting MUCH more from the final boss fight. It was short, boring, and it was very easy.

Also the GoW games have been known for its excellent use of its camera. In part III however, I found myself getting cheap deaths because i missed a pit or misjudged distance because the camera was out of place.

After years of waiting for this game, it took only 9 hours to beat it on normal mode. And unlike the previous games, I won't be replaying this one anytime soon. This game just doesnt have the spark the last two games did."
2377,3,"Get what you pay for, works well, but keys will instantly start rubbing off after a few weeks/months. Even the cheap walmart 5 dollar one I had that finally broke after years didn't have keys that rubbed off. Backspace is also too small.

Aside from that works well."
2378,3,"Well received on the specified date.

2379,3,"it was 1995 every one i knew had a Pc but my family could not afford one.  i gamed on my genesis.  then one day my dad a factory worker walked in with  a compaq presario.
i was super exited to use a computer for the first time.  after a month or to i wanted to buy a game.  so i got on my bike with my allowance and walked into my local video game store.  i saw a bright colored box with the price tag of 30 bucks.  it looked cool so i grabbed it and went over to the counter.  (i was 9 0r 10 )  the guy at the counter looked at the box and looked at me and shrugged (now my 4 year old cant buy a disney game at gamestop without me)  i payed the 30 dollars and ran home.
my parents were in there late 50s and weren't tec savey and didn't care about violent games.  i played for hours i was hooked...  the game was TES arena

my review follows below

The elder scrolls arena was and still is a cult classic .  the game is highly fun but very glitchy and buggy .  it crashed our PC a few times as well.  it is huge
with 4,000 plus towns and cities.  however time has not treated  this baby well.  the graphics were never good but now they look like muddy water splashed on a screen.

after around 300 hours i had seen around 5 percent of the game its that big.  the reason why the game gets 3 stars is it is incredibly buggy and glitchy and crashes my PC
i found this baby in my garage as i was looking for my tool box and i going to boot it up with my presario

HAPPY GAMING

2380,3,"What we have here is a bunch of characters that seem to believe they are better than all that and seem to want to show it.  Though the arrogance in the past DMCs had been oftentimes intolerable at least they were funny.  This just seems like the characters are so mightier than thou that they got lost on what humor actually is.  Dante is even insufferable at times.  But, let's not hold that against the entire game.

To start off this is definitely not like the older games where your hands fall off from smashing buttons and attempting to do ridiculous combos without pause throughout the duration of the game. Speaking of the combos, they last about three hours apiece so if you like theatrics then this game is for you.

On the subject of how this game is so much different from the others, where's Dante?!  We want to play as Dante!  Nero might be a close resemblance to Dante, but he whines too much and is certainly NOT Dante.  Even though Dante's arrogance is as acceptable as a knee to the groin, I would prefer it over Nero's constant blabbering and complaining.  More importantly, I'm not exactly pleased with the story of chasing after a girl.  Whereas the previous games have been about fighting against evil with a sidekick that happened to be female, this game has our white-haired heart-throb (no, not Dante, Nero...I know they look strikingly alike) is chasing AFTER a girl who happens to get caught up in the demonic world.  It just doesn't seem very DMC'ish.

However, the combat is fun because of the style that Capcom introduces on a far larger level than any of the DMCs beforehand.  As stated earlier, if you have a penchant for the ""cool"" and ""exciting"" things you can do with a gun and a sword then this game is for you.  And if you don't have a penchant for it, perhaps you shouldn't be playing video games.

Another problem I have with the game is that I can't stand the timed puzzles with fixed cameras that have you falling down into an abyss where you have to fight the same group of enemies twenty thousand times.  It's infuriating, but at least it gives you some kind of satisfaction when you make it to the other side.  However, the puzzles where you're smacking a dice across the room?  Not exactly my cup of tea.

Halfway through the game you have to do the previous levels in reverse which makes me think that Capcom got bored with designing new levels and thought it a smashing idea to just have everything backwards.  It harks on the design of Nero being strikingly similar to Dante.  Instead of making a new character it seems just a rehash of a more prepubescent Dante.  So, we have duplicates of everything.  Why?  Why couldn't you just create new levels, Capcom?  Makes me believe there's a laziness factor occurring.

My concern is that they are trying to play this off as a girl and guy game.  Both sexes can play it.  That's all well and good, but I could very easily play the first three and I'm a girl.  It's turning into a fanfiction of the previous games which spins off into the realm of depending on combat style to support the game.  Though the combat style, as said, is good, it's not worth buying the game for.  That is, unless, you're like me and are a fan of the series.

Let's just hope that it doesn't continue down this track, which I'm afraid it might."
2381,3,"Super Mario 64 was a great game. Mario 64 DS is way diffrent. I love the fact that you can be Luigi, Yoshi, and Wario but the controls are very confusing to me. With the 64 you get the control stick and B and A plus the c buttons to look around. on the DS you only get 4 buttons plus directional buttons. It was confusing to me. But I loved the graphics. DS is the wave of the future. but for me I'll stick to my GBA SP."
2382,3,"At first, the game was fun and then when I was near the end, it got really boring so I ended up not finishing the game. I wouldn't buy other Zelda games in the future."
2383,3,"Gameplay is fun, but there are lots of explosions. Everytime something explores, you get double images. You can get really dizzy if you are not very used to it."
2384,3,"I'm a Neptunia fan, I like how the games are a joke on the gaming industry with Neptune being a spoof off Sega, Noire being based on Playstation, Vert is based on Xbox and Blanc whom is the main character of this game is based on Nintendo. My first thoughts to sum up would be, this really feels and plays like Action U (without the clothes ripping) that was released earlier last year with an extremely shorter story. The menus and the way you pick you levels all feel almost the same just with a different color scheme. You're still taking out baddies in a Dynasty Warriors fashion with multiple enemies on screen and you can level each girl with AP points earned from completing missions.

Story mode is based around Blanc and Neptune to restore a failing High School and decide to make a film club that could make a really awesome movie that the school will flood with more students going. From there on out, you'll see two sprites on screen, a few jokes thrown in and what feels like the same battle arena.

If there were going to at least try to give the game a saving grace is the combat is a step above Action U, but not by much. You're forced to level up a character and learn new combos while Action U is gave you them up front. Each character handles differently such as Neptune utalizing her sword and new comer (who really has no story expect for one scene) Tamsoft has a large broad sword that is slow, but can do massive damage. However you play, you'll probably pick that character and use them for most of the game. Regardless if the story ends up in an alternate scene. Which doesn't really change much honestly and not worth going and watch the scene a second time.

Multiplayer can be a blast and sometimes be a headache. For me, matches are far in between and thankfully if you do finish story with the same character you can play the first few matches alone with ease. Later on though, it becomes this trial and error and learning how to hit and dodge over powering bosses with three others. You can't go HDD and you do not have a partner. Instead you're knocked out until someone can revive you, however revives also costs EX and if you're a lower level you might just be ignored if you fall in battle.

While Tamsoft is known for making Senran Kagura and Action U, I'd say put your money the new Senran Kagura game. Wait for this to go on sale, trust me you'll thank me later. If you are however a huge Neptunia fan, I guess you could get it for the frantic multiplayer games. Again though, Senran Kagura is loads more polished than this being ""What other genre can Neptunia be slapped onto."""
2385,3,"Its a great shooter.  Its really grindy though and after doing five of the same raid in one night, you'd get really tired of it too. Its like all the really fun aspects and weapons of the game are kept from you until you spend a whole, solid, month killing everything that moves and by then you just stop caring"
2386,3,"If you've played Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, this game will be familiar to you.  It's basically the same puzzle but with more levels, places to go.

Challenge of the Warlords was really a fantastic game, a surprise hit, very addictive.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Galactrix.  Even though the puzzle is the same, same addictive RPG elements, there's some things they took away / changed for the worse.

*Took away the character difference.  Instead of different characters with different power-ups, you now buy your skills ( space ship add-ons).
*Completely style control ONLY, some times, it's not very accurate on the main map.  Slow to react when you try to fly from Point A to Point B.
*Long Long loading times, every single screen takes a long load time.  For a minute there, you would think this is on PSP, never played a ds game with this much load time.
*Weak tutorial - even though you kow how to play the puzzle, but the rest of the game is a bit confusing.  How experience builds up, etc.  Need to read the manual.

Really, the biggest flaw is the long load times.  I don't see much graphic improvement over Warlord, if there is, rather have the same old graphics & shorten the load time.  1 hour of game play, 10 minutes spent on load screens."
2387,3,"The graphics on this game are nice, the controls certainly could be a little better but I had a few problems with it. First it's short. It might take awhile to beat all three campaigns but it seemed like just when I was getting into playing a species it was over. Second the story. It seemed to steal a lot of the scenery from the first and worst alien vs predator movie. The pyramids, The big predator statues, having bishop being the head of the weyland corporation. I mean the first alien vs predator movie was horrible, PG-13 yuk. So why take so much from it? Third I hated you never get a chance to fight the alien queen. You see her once and just blow her up before she can move. There's a few other parts you run into what looks like an alien queen but way too small. Fourth is the controls. As a marine it's similar to call of duty except you can't aim down your sights. Your always shooting from the hip unless your using the sniper rifle and that can get irritating trying to hit fast aliens or face hungers. Playing the alien it gets irritating the awkward shifting between walls and the ground. A lot of times I would sneak up on an enemy climbing the walls and when i transitioned off it would put me with my back turned to them. Alot of times before I could turn around they would already be attacking me. Then there's the weapons. You can only carry 3 clips for your pulse rifle or 20 shotgun shells. The predator doesn't start out with all the weapons and by the time you get them the game is over. I don't want to sound too hard on the game but it could have been done better. I would still recommend picking it up if you can find a cheap copy. I should add to as the alien your ending is you turn into a queen I wish they had made a few levels where you could play as the alien queen, that would have been fun."
2388,3,"Although very ""cheesy"" to a large degree, I think the game well captured the ""Bond Experience"" with many of the exciting set piece levels within the game. I did however found the driving parts to be very lame because the controls were ""too loose"" and it was difficult to steer vehicles without crashing into something which causes me to slow down a lot during timed mission. Also, for me playing a game as a ""super spy,"" going stealth was sometimes a pain to pull off during some missions because the enemies are usually there just waiting for me to ""go around that corner"" or ""open that door"" so that they can get me. The music, character models, hand to hand combat, and shooting mechanics though, were all well done. The opening theme song sung by Mya was the best thing I liked about the game. It's a good game to play, and i'm sure people who play it will have fun with it if they are into James Bond."
2389,3,"This game aint out yet, i aint played it yet and i have only seen small clips from it but everything in my body tells me that this is going to be a wicked game.
I have no real idea of the content besides what has already been said here and the Offical Xbox Mag but it looks good.
There are only 3 games im lookin forward to buying outright (no rental) this year and they are Fable, Halo 2 and this one. I have no doubt that this will be a first class game which MAY even revial the forever glowing Halo.
I will write a review for this game when i play it. For now this is just a ramble to say i think it is worth the risk to just purchase this game outright without a rental. I hope we all won't be let down for doing so.... I Doubt We Will :)
Enter The Matrix's ASAP!"
2390,3,"I give it a three star because NoughtyDog really change the game play of the game, they made it more realistic on the shooting and on the blocky movement.

Compare to the second, first to the third they really change how you play.

The first Uncharted and the second Uncharted they really show how realistic the characters movement are, they also feels more smoother than the third uncharted.

I think in the Uncharted 3 they really focus on the multiplayer more and its very disappointing as a fan because its not as fluid anymore and animation are less on the characters.

The game doesn't feel unique anymore.

But the game do has lots of potential on multiplayer, its more competitive and challenging."
2391,3,I'll take this one over DOA:X any day.  It's a REAL VOLLEYBALL game.  A damn good one too.
2392,3,"Everone knows that Nintendo is not quite known for creating fighting games. The company is known for its signature Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda and Metroid games. However Nintendo teamed up with Rare to create a fighting game which used a technology similar to their hit 1994 game, Donkey Kong Country. The result was the arcade fighter Killer Instinct. The SNES version was releasd in 1995.
The story behind the game, as with most fighting games, is quite lame. An organisation called ""Ultratech"" is pitting various fighters against each other for its own ulterior motives. There are ten fighters which are Thunder, Cinder, Glacius, Fulgore, Jago, Orchid, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal and T.J. Combo. The characters themselves show a fair amount of variation, from the ninja-ish Jago to the robotic Fulgore to the dinosaur Riptor to the red indian Chief Thunder. The boss is Eyedol. The game offers a vast amount of moves for each character, including special moves, secret ""combo-breakers,"" ultra combos, finishing moves, humiliations (a bit like Mortal Kombat's ""friendships""), stage fatalities and more. What Killer Instinct is really known for are the combos. Depending on the number of hits they range from ""triple"" to ""blaster"" to ""monster"" to ""ultra."" Despite all this variation, I only enjoyed a few characters like Jago, Combo, Cinder and Thunder.
Just as in the Donkey Kong Country games, the graphics are amazing. The backgrounds range from medieval castles to rooftops to factories to canyons. The fighters have fluid animation, flashy moves and various coloured outfits to choose from. The sound effects are not bad, but some characters make weird noises, for example, Cinder, Glacius and Riptor. The music is extremely well done. Each background has music which matches its atmosphere. I loved Jago's stage back then (a bit like Ryu's from Street Fighter II). The game controls quite well, but some attacks are unavoidable and quite often you'll get beaten up by some cheap move, despite how strategic you get. The game balance is also a bit off. If you want to win, choose Combo, Jago or Fulgore. If you want to lose, pick Sabrewulf, Riptor or Spinal. Ironically, the computer controlled Spinal provides a good challenge. Eyedol is also a worthy opposition, but like I said above, if you make a single wrong move somewhere, you may end up getting beaten up continuously until you die.
Overall however, for a company that's been making side-scrolling action games and adventure games, Killer Instinct is a surprisingly good effort in the fighting game department. If you want a really solid game for your SNES, with great graphics and music that will provide hours of fun and amusement, Killer Instinct is for you."
2393,3,Fights are too many and roleplaying is too low ... starting fights are too difficult with krappy gear....:( Disappointed :(
2394,3,It's a fun game
2395,3,The game was good for me but im still not a fan of the online gaming of gears of war call me crazy but i don't like it.
2396,3,joystick and buttons feel a little stiff
2397,3,Cool
2398,3,"This is a nice controller, lots of buttons and programmability, perfect for PC games or playing your favorite console emulators. The key-mapping features are excellent because you can create seperate profiles for each PC game or emulator. You can also use the Shift to give buttons a seperate function. Setting up turbo buttons is easy to learn.

This pad is nice, but not flawless.
Here are my gripes about the P25000.

1: I really don't see the point of having Rumble Pack as there are so few games that even use it. I was never a big fan of rumble and always thought it to be over-rated.

2: This pad is wireless, which might be nice... but then you have to deal with the batteries dying.
Personally I like the Saitek P880 better because it doesn't give me many problems.

3: The L and R shoulder button's are a little too flush with the rest of the unit, they should be thicker, stick out more and give a good springy resistence like the rest of the buttons on the P880.

2: Pushing the D-pad up, down, or right makes a tick noise because its edges are hitting against the plastic housing. It doesn't do this when you press Left, there's just a nice rubbery springiness. ALL of the directions on the pad should feel this way. And why a hard plastic D-pad anyway? A softer plastic one would've been nicer and probably last longer.

Actually I had an idea... anyone remember Turbo Touch 360? It was like this little magic flat orange d-pad that sensed the heat of your thumb and kept you from getting blisters, now those were kewel. How come they don't make a PC gamepad with something like that?

The Saiteks come with a 2 YEAR WARRANTY. So in the unlikely event that the controller breaks before then, if you still have your proof of purchase (reciept) you can get a new one sent to you or pick it up at the store you bought it from."

Main positive is that VT4 implements 1:1 VERY well.
Main negative is that there isn't a tournament mode for Move players.

Please check out the video review for further details."
2400,3,"This is a beautiful(forest,water,beaches) platform game. Very realistic and detailed. Daxter adds the cuteness factor while being the ""mascot"". Luckily, you have missions; go out and find power cells,etc. Unfortunately, that can get reeally boring after searching and searching. If you don't get everything you can't move to the next part. Probably best to have the strategy guide next to you. On my own I grew frusterated and wasn't close to finishing the game by the time it was due back. I do wonder that if I had bought it, I'd have gotten farther and feel differently. After this, there were two Jak minus Daxter games made which turned me off and reviews for those said that the games were in a new battle type direction, so I never tried any more."
2401,3,"Its exactly what you need if you text chat a lot. It is also exactly what you need if you want a quick way to send a message or email without dealing with the on screen key typing. Nothing is more frustrating than using a joy stick to go from letter to letter trying to type a message..it takes forever. This device, (PS3 Wireless Keypad) definitely shortens the time it takes to type a message. BUT it has a major FLAW. If you are sitting in a dark room staring into your magnificent HDTV, you are not going to be able to type anything because you CAN'T see the keys. Why? Because the Keys do not light up!!!  Major FLAW.  And the buttons / keys are somewhat hard to press.  It might be better with softer rubbery keys or at least keys like the Blackberry keys...that light up.  But for functionality, there are all the buttons and controls you can ask for.  Don't get me wrong...having it is better than not having it. Just remember to keep a light source near by if you play in the dark in case you have to type a message while you are playing in the dark.

Aside from the keys not lighting up, Sony has done a great job. This thing is blu tooth and most importantly is rechargeable via USB same as your PS3 controller.  Also you will have no trouble syncing it to your PS3...It does it automatically when you turn the device on and start typing. I gave it a 3 star rating only because the keys do not light up.  If it did, it would be GREAT!!!!

NOTE: Trouble Shooting Tip: When the battery is low or the device is out of sync, it will flash red and green lights on the device. All you have to do is just use a pin to press the tiny reset button.:-) Thought you should know because when it happened to me, I thought the thing was broken and I was about to return it."
2402,3,The online multiplayer rocks campaign is soso.
2403,3,"This mic is the cheapest I could find at the time but my only problem is that it slips out place and for a guy playing Call of Duty, that's a problem. You should only get this if you want a mic for the lowest price. Overall, I rate it 3/5!"
2404,3,"Like many, I grew up with Bob Barker and the Price is Right.  I was excited to see there was a wii game with modern day prices and classic games like Plinko and Punch Out.  While the prices are a bit higher on the store shelves, the game is a lot of fun.  I don't see myself playing it all the time, but I will probably come back to this from time to time for a bit of nostalgia."
2405,3,"I just got this CD as a gift as my sister found a brand new copy at a Goodwill for $1.99. Most of the stuff in it is fairly worthless unless you have seasons, which I don't. This CD is almost all Christmas, with Halloween-Hannukah-Kwanza as afterthoughts. There are a few nice Asian outfits thrown in and some long Santa style beards which were handy. Some of the doors and windows are alright additions. The Halloween objects totaled 3, all of which are available on EA's site. Sadly, there were no new Halloween face paints, monster masks, etc.

Overall, this isn't too bad if you can get it for $5 or less, unless you really love Christmas."
2406,3,"This is a 3 person shooter to play. It is not as good as HALO or Gears of war. The boss fight are a little too hard, at least for me. With some bosses I took over two hours to finish the fight."
2407,3,"I just got the screen protector. I found that the bottom one for the touch screen was easy to apply (if you apply it carefully) and works well. You can't tell there's a screen protector on at all. However, the top screen seemed a waste of time...it only had sticky stuff around the edges...and I thought that the quality of the screen was poor, and just decided to throw it away. I really only wanted a protector for the bottom screen anyway, and thats where you really need the protection. It's also a plus that they give you a cleaning cloth and a tool to push the bubbles out from under the new screen."
2408,3,"It has been some time before I have put together a review, but I feel compelled to write one regarding my experience with this game. This review will not be long because all the information that one can know about this game has already been said. I have played every Resident Evil game to date, and this game was by far a big disappointment. Lets start off with the good.

Graphics. The graphics are superb and are nothing short of amazing. They are surreal and very creepy. This game will show you what the next generation of games are capable out doing. The shadows, lighting, textures, I have nothing bad to say. Even the first person view works very well.

Sound. The sound is superb, down the the floors you walk on and creepy background noises, it is all top notch.

Story. The story is not great but not bad. It holds its own and I respect that Capcom is taking a different direction, as the old formula has been used many times over. In my opinion, the video tapes the player finds over time may have been better off being cutscenes, because some of these are a little tiresome to play through, and the game could have used some great cutscenes.

Controls. Everything is good and you can even turn off the HUD which is a great feature. The only thing that I hate is how the player runs. You need to jam in the left joy stick and hold it forward. This gets very tiring considering how much running the player will be doing, and I can imagine its not the best thing for the joy stick over time.

Gameplay. This is where it all falls apart. There is no gameplay. All these great weapons you find will hardly ever be used. The Baker Family is about all there is in the game, with the exception of a few others here and there which I will not spoil. Each section of the map is small and dominated by one of the family members and they chase you around here and there and it eventually culminates into a boss fight of some kind. The game is way to scripted and does not feature enough elements to offer any replay value, and the unlockable difficulty simply does not cut it. There is no horde mode of any kind, and there is not enough going on inside the games world to make me ever want to play it again.

Some can counter this by saying it is more of a psychological horror game and not intended to be a frantic first person shooter, and I can see this as being true and I agree. However, I did not have much fun playing it. Yes, Capcom did take the series back to its roots in being creepy, but a game needs to be creepy while remaining fun. When I think of a game being creepy and still being fun, I think of The Evil Within and Deadspace 1 & 2. Lets leave the psychological horror to P.T. which according to my understanding got cancelled and will never see the light of day.

Final Verdict. Cool for one playthrough but offers no replay value. I recommend waiting for a price drop or picking it up as a rental.

2409,3,"After playing Lego Star Wars I was very excited to get this game but it was a bit of a let down.

It's more repetitive than Star Wars, has fewer characters, and just doesn't have the grand scale that Lego Star Wars has.

Perhaps if I had played this first I would have liked it better but with such high expectations after Lego Star Wars it just seemed boring."
2410,3,"Works great!
Just a little too long cable."
2411,3,Good fast but button to mute is stuck
2412,3,"Sonic Rivals was one of the first games I got for my PSP. It's fun when you start, and it's pretty cool collecting cards, but then it gets really boring and repetitive. I always try to collect new cards, but I always get the same cards. And the roster is also sort of boring. Silver, Sonic, and Shadow are fast (obviously) and Knuckles is the slowest, that's all there is to know. The only character I like is Metal Sonic. The storyline is also very boring, just people chasing Eggman Nega and Eggman. That's not a big deal, though, because I don't buy video games to read them. I would recommend this game to (maybe) have on the go, but not to play at home or something. Just something to do when you're bored."
2413,3,"I'm not going to get into the discussion of whether this game is better or worse than GTA IV. Both games may be the same genre (that began with GTA), but that's the only thing they have in common. Saints Row 2 is an all-out celebration of sex and violence with it's tongue planted firmly in cheek. There are no apologies for it's mature content and I like that! If you're going to be an M rated game then go all out with it and don't hold back, and Volition held nothing back for Saints Row 2. It's a blast to play, you get knee deep into the action right away and the wild ride never stops. There isn't a dull moment to be found. If you're looking for sandbox crime action, this may arguably be the best one out there (for next-gen systems anyway). Customization is king in Saints Row 2. You can customize just about everything in the game. From your crib, to your clothes, to your rides... you can alter them all. Customization can get pretty crazy too. For example, if you're a guy you can walk around in your boxers and if you're a woman you can walk around in just a tiny t-shirt and panties, or go naked (with your naughty bits censored of course). This can make the cut scenes pretty hilarious to say the least!

The new features of Saints Row 2 are pretty cool. Co-op play has been added (via Xbox Live or system link) and now you can play as a female, not just a male. A female friend of mine said she was going to pick up this game simply because of this feature, so more games should utilize this. There's a lot to do in the game as well. I've been playing all day and I'm only 3% into the game (I've been doing more side missions and exploration), so the game is going to offer hours of gameplay. Also, you can double the play time by playing thru as a man and then a woman to experience the subtle changes made in the game between the sexes.

Unfortunately, not all is perfect with Saints Row 2. Like I said, I've been playing all day (over 8 hours) and my game has froze dead in it's tracks not once, not twice, not three times, but four times!!! It happened during the Mayhem mode when I had tons of cops on my tail. This is really unacceptable. I've also noticed several small, yet annoying glitches that hamper the fun factor of the game. For example, while having several cops on my tail I had to switch cars. Several cops were on foot close to me as I tried to jack a car. I pushed Y to get into the car,  instead of getting in, my character froze and one of the cops near me got inside the car I wanted instead. It was a temporary freeze, and I quickly pulled the cop out of the car once I could move again, but I have a feeling glitches like this could just be the tip of the iceberg.
With that said, I still love the game. The fun factor out weighs the glitches and freezes, but I did remove 2 stars due to these problems. If it wasn't for that, Saints Row 2 would've easily been a perfect 5 star game, but things like this should really get fixed before they're released to the public.

The collectible tin, bullet usb drive and money clip are pretty cool, but the art book is a joke and a copy of the soundtrack (ala GTA IV collector's edition) would've been a perfect touch, especially since this is $79.99 and not $69.99. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the series, I would skip this Collector's Edition. I bought it because I simply enjoy owning collector's editions of... anything.

So, if you can remember to frequently save your game and you don't mind game freezes and a few glitches here and there, then I highly recommend you spend some quality time in the Row. It's a fun place to visit!"
2414,3,I've played the first 5 chapters the game is ok. The story is terrible the characters are terrible the gameplay is good the level design is lacking but it's still pretty fun just not the aaa title I wanted. but my main issue is the game freezing up on me I can't get past the 5th chapter because every time dynamite explodes the game freezes!! Is anyone else having these issues.?

2417,3,"I tried to fill this thing up but it stopped at 64 even though it said it had 128, the PS2 formatted it and it then said it only really had 64MB but it cost the same as a 64MB card so 3 stars Ha!"

2420,3,"Tales of Zestiria is better that the universally nonsensical Tales sequels but i still can't recommend it and even burned out on the game. The Tales franchise never had ""good"" narratives but this one is outright bad. Every character is most importantly an unengaging clich and the addition of character fusions to the battle system need to be fixed or leave the franchise immediately. Even the technical side felt as if it took a step back. Let's see how the upcoming ""prequel"" will shake out but the developer needs to move on from the decade old PS3. Zestria functions fine enough so veterans may last till the open ending, which is even locked behind Dlc, but newcomers should instead invest into recent entries as Graces f, Hearst R, Syphnia Chronicles 1, Xillia 1 or Vesperia instead. 6,5/10
It's usually the follow ups that fall short"
2421,3,This does have a cord it's not cordless. It's also not as useful as I thought it would be.
2422,3,"Dragon Age: Origins being a lovely homage to classic Infinity Engine role-playing games was a great surprise and a light in the darkness of mid-2000's PC gaming, where it seemed everything was console-focused. Dragon Age 2, while deeply flawed, at least maintained that tactical PC style combat at the heart of it. Now, in an age where indie studios, Kickstarter and digital distribution have opened the gates to numerous classic PC style RPGs, where does the third Dragon Age game come out? Firmly in the console action game camp, sadly.

There are a few immediate aspects to Inquisition you need to know. First, the areas and quests and extremely MMO-like in how they play. This is an offline WoW game with action combat, very similar to Kingdoms of Amalur, which I reviewed a couple years ago. Quest dialog is very rare and very simple when it happens. Most quests will be started by letters or discovering them on your war room map. None of them have cinematic or dialog tree moments, all of them play just like an MMO quest would. There are many ""collect 10 of these for the villagers"" quests. There are many enemy bases that are nothing but several rooms of enemies and a boss who attacks on-sight. There are even fairly obvious respawns should you turn around for any reason!

Secondly, this game controls like a port of a gamepad action game. That's not to say the PC version controls ""badly"" necessarily, as for a standard WASD action game I think it controls about normal. The lack of click-to-move and click-to-attack and such is a fundamental game decision, not a control issue. You play this game running around the fields and mashing your attack buttons when you stumble on an enemy. You run up to things and press 'E' to interact with them. It's a third-person action game in control and design, not a PC style RPG, and that's the core control ""issue."" If you like games like Witcher 2 or Kingdoms of Amalur you'll be okay here.

Lastly, the tactical combat is rare. Ninety percent of your combat experience will be in the field with trash mobs, just like an MMO. Every once in a while you will fight a boss or other set-piece, which could be considered roughly the equivalent of Dragon Age: Origins' designed tactical battles. However even in these confrontations you'll mostly be playing it action style. There are less abilities and your companions spam them appropriately, so there is little reason to switch to them and look at an empty hotbar. The game is designed to control your main character in action game fashion and anything else is superfluous. You might pause here and there to ensure someone takes a potion or gets out of dodge (on hard mode) but otherwise even in these ""tactical battles"" you can just run around and spam your abilities appropriately.

These complaints and changes aside, graphics and story are up to the usual Bioware standard. I'm playing on an older PC with a mix of medium and high settings and it still looks amazing, well above the two previous games in both scope and detail. The visual design is mostly fabulous, though it reminds you constantly that it's all for show and nothing is really happening in these great areas. While a great lighthouse can be found through exploring a beautiful swamp, once you get there all you can do is plant a flag for yet another collect-a-thon sidequest. No one lives there, no real quest goes there, it's just art for art's sake.

The main quest is very good however. I am in the final act and it goes through a lot of religious, social and personal themes that most games wouldn't touch. You can be Jesus or Judas, or you can be a frustrated atheist struggling to deal with all of it. That comes across quite well. On average the main quests are better designed than the MMO filler side-content, and offer unique dungeons and areas that feel more in tune with Dragon Age's previous. It's almost like two different games, and I wish the main quest game were the one we got everywhere else.

All in all if you like MMO quest design and action combat you will find a lot to like here. I'm still not sure as an action experience it can really top dedicated action games, but it does an okay job and the exploring and great story will be all a lot of people want or expect from it. If you're looking for a PC RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins however, you will not find it here, and you will be filled with disappointment and not a small amount of resentment as a result. Know what you're getting into going in and Inquisition might be a thrilling experience."
2423,3,"Katamari Damacy is weird, everything to its wildly addicting gameplay to its catchy themesong its just bizzare. The gamplay, the story is about the king of all cosmos lost all the stars so he has to send his son to earth to roll up the earth in a katamari. Every small object can be rolled up by your katamari. Once you successfully rolled up a big anough katamari in the time given you may ethier choose if you want it to ba a star of stardust. There is also Vs mode you can play with freinds. The graphics aren't going to win any awards and the story is stupid, but you still might be sitting there for hours playing this game. They also used a unique way of moving your katamari and how it is a challenging game but i won't take the obsessed gamer a day to beat. Its addicitive but not in a fun way. I give it 3 stars

Positive Side

+ Cool gameplay

+ Unique Controls

+ Perfect Soundtrack

Negitive Side

- Way to short

- Not alot of dept

- Crapy Graphics"
2424,3,"I'm actually pretty new to the Broken Sword series since I never played adventure games on PC back in the day.  I only played a Broken Sword game for the first time on DS when I picked up the DS port of Broken Sword: Shadows of the Templars.  I enjoyed it enough to want to play the sequel, but I kept waiting for someone to release it as a DS port just like the first.  Well, that never happened, so I figured I might as well pick up the sequel on Playstation 1, a console that I still own.  I'm sure that the interface on DS is much better than this old PS1 game could ever be, but I was tired of waiting and I'd like to know what happens next to our plucky hero and heroine...

Graphics (score 7/10): Well, maybe these were good graphics back in the day.  I'd say for PS1 era and the time that this game was released as a whole, the graphics are average.  I know some people would say that the cutscenes look great for PS1, but bear in mind that everything is 2-D animation, which is easier to do than 3-D models.  I would say that the 2-D animation has allowed it to age well (the art style bears a striking resemblance to Dragon's Lair).  On the downside, the in-game environments are a bit fuzzy.  This normally wouldn't be much of an issue, but since this is a point and click game where you are expected to pick small objects out of the environment, it is  troublesome.  Since this is a PS1 game, though, I'm not sure how much they could've done this better or if it's merely an insurmountable limitation of the system.  Oh well, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was a hardware limitation.

Music (score 6/10): Well, the music itself is decent, but it suffers from the same problem the original Broken Sword did: it just fades in and out randomly.  I feel like the music never sticks around consistently for an area (it just appears, then leaves in silence).  Some people may not be annoyed by this, but it bugs me.  Oh well.  The other thing of note is that this game is fully voiced!  Yes, it's very rare to have a voiced PS1 game.  Of course, there's a reason for that.  The voice acting seems decent, but the sound quality makes all the voices sound muffled and fuzzy.  This problem is so bad that I had to turn on the subtitles to make sure I didn't miss any dialogue.  I guess I should give them credit for trying...

Characters (score 7/10): Your main characters are George (an American tourist) and Nico (a French journalist and George's somewhat girlfriend) who were featured in the first game.  You'll mostly be controlling George.  He's a decent protagonist, and often has something witty to say about things (a bit like a milder version of Phoenix Wright) that will keep you playing.  Nico is a decent and believable in her role as well.  There's also a whole cast of side characters that are rather amusing (my favorite being Duane, the man who may or may not be working for the CIA).  Overall, the characters are decent and likable, but not extremely memorable.

Story (score 7/10): The game starts you right off with George and Nico getting back together (about six months after the events of the original game).  They go to visit some archaeologist (Nico's idea) and she's immediately kidnapped.  George winds up tied to a chair with a giant spider coming towards him (and the room's on fire to boot).  What a great way to start off your story with excitement!  Anyway, I'm not going to spoil all the rest of the details but it basically involves them globe-trotting and solving mysteries related to Mayan mythology...  All I can say is that the plot, while good, does feel like it's too rushed to properly build up to the epic ending they go for.  In fact, I think the humorous aspects of the game will keep you playing moreso than the overarching plot.

Gameplay (score 5/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  In case you have no idea what you are getting into, this is a point and click adventure game.  The gameplay is based on the idea of solving problems by examining things in your environment and coming up with creative solutions.  As a whole, I like this genre, but this game has several gameplay issues that mar the experience.  First off, there is no tutorial at the beginning, they just thrust you into the game (with a giant spider coming toward you, no less!).  Once you get used to the icons and what they mean, it isn't a problem though.  However, the save menu is a complete nightmare.  This is literally the most backwards and stupid save menu I've yet seen on the system.  Basically, it loads and brings up ALL the save data on the card, then you have to scroll down (every time!) to an empty slot to save.  Then, when you try to save later, it won't let you - you literally have to manually delete the original save data, and then save a new one.  That is madness.  There's also an option to format the memory card, which is a terribly dangerous thing to have in-game.  There's also the issue I touched on in the graphics section.  You basically a very hard time seeing certain items because they are almost invisible in the background graphics (it took me forever to find the light switch in that warehouse).  I also take issue with the icons that are used for items and dialogue.  The item icons are rather hard to tell what exactly they are meant to be, thankfully, when you push the O button, it gives you a description of what it is.  There is no such description for dialogue, so you never quite know what you are going to talk about.  Could it have killed them to put a bit of text on screen when you select each icon?  Sigh.  Another issue is that some of the puzzles are a bit difficult to solve, and I often resorted to a guide (often the problem was based on the graphical issues I mentioned earlier).  Furthermore, there are certain segments in the game where you literally must figure out what to do in a short amount of time or you will get an instant game over.  I do not like this feature - I feel it is really not fun in a game of this sort of genre.  A game like this is about patiently solving problems methodically, and timing based stuff really should not be part of the experience.  Lastly, this game is also rather short - clocking in at 8-10 hours (but with all these gameplay issues, perhaps it's for the best).

Overall (score 6/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  This could have been a decent point and click adventure game, but not on this console.  I feel like the PS1's limitations really hamper this game and keep it from shining.  It's an awful shame, though, as the dialogue is quite good.  I'd love to see this game ported to the DS like the first one was, but as it is, I really can't recommend it on the PS1.  The only way I'd encourage anyone to buy this game on this console is if they played the first one and are just itching to know what happens next..."
2425,3,"I bought the CM Storm Recon along with three other mice when searching for the ""perfect mouse"". I still haven't found it, but please read my review of the R.A.T.9 for a comparison. The other two I tested just aren't worth mentioning. I have large hands, not in the bulky sense but in the lanky/long fingered sense. I have a hard time using mice as they're typically made for the average hand size which is considerably smaller than mine. I put in at least 400 hours with this mouse using various games and programs before reviewing.

Overall, this mouse was an OK fit for me, but not great. The body is a good width, but too short so it didn't fill my palm swell and I ended up ""claw gripping"" it. I prefer a modified claw grip where my my palm swell (the back part towards the thumb) touches the back of the mouse, and then my fingertips touch the buttons and nothing in between. This is mostly due to no mouse being long enough where my entire hand can rest on the body (R.A.T. 9 included, though it is longer than the Storm Recon). The texture on the Storm Recon and buttons was pleasing and felt comfortable and controllable.

The main and secondary buttons have a good click feel. They are firm but responsive so you can't click accidentally. The same cannot be said for the side buttons. There are four side buttons, two on each. I handed the mouse to my wife who has smaller hands, she felt the same way about the side buttons (so is't not just my crazy hand size/grip). We both found that the side buttons were too sensitive. Moving the mouse left or right could accidentally trigger one of the buttons if your thumb/pinkie was near a button. The mouse wheel button and DPI adjust buttons were firm and I could not find a way to accidentally trigger them.

The downloadable mouse configuration tool allows the user to customize the buttons, set action groups, set DPI adjust levels, set mouse wheel speed, and set the LED colors. The tool allow a wide variety of customization, but it is beleaguered by a very poor example of user interface, but if you only have to go into it once in a while it is tolerable. Like other CM products, the LED lights are user configurable. You can set them for a default color, or various colors based on the speed of the mouse.

The largest detractor for me was the USB disconnect issue. This shows up on CM storm's support site, but I've read it on forums as well with no resolution. If you are using the CM Storm Recon, and put the computer to sleep the mouse will not power on when the computer wakes. Often you can unplug/replug and it will work. Sometimes you have to switch it to a different USB bus (depending on your computer, the face and rear USB ports are on a different bus. I also have a USB 3.0 bus so I can switch between three busses. Often, there is no resolution besides restarting for me. Not every user experiences this. I have a home built AMD rig with good quality components running Windows 7. YMMV.

Summary:
An average mouse for average sized hands. Avoid it if you have large hands. If you get the USB disconnect issue, return it immediately, there is no way to fix this. The only reason I keep it around is if I forget to charge up my wireless mouse and need to do something on the computer while the battery is charging.

Pros:
+ good gripping surface
+ sensitive and high DPI laser
+ adjustable DPI buttons on mouse
+ 9 programmable buttons (if you reconfigure the 2 DPI adjusters)
+ programmable action groups

Cons:
- USB disconnect issue
- poor UI for managing the mouse configurations
- small mouse body for larger/longer than average hands
- overly sensitive side buttons"
2426,3,"If the ball had such a high propensity for being lost down the side as they do in this game, pinball machines would have died out a long time ago."
2427,3,"The 'Tales' series has built a notable fan base through its story, and while this was my first of the series I can say it's reputation is well earned. All of the main characters grow over the course of the game, the antagonist has reason and redeeming qualities rather than just being obligatorily evil, and there are some surprising plot twists. While a couple of the characters (Anise) remain largely comic relief, everybody's got good points of progression and solid motivations.
Story: 8.6/10

People who don't like cell-shading won't like it, but those who can look past the unique art style will find a vibrantly-colored world. Magic, skills and Overlimits look suitably flashy, it's not as sharp and beautiful as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hack-G-U-Vol-1-Rebirth/dp/B000G7X5OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">.hack: G.U., Vol. 1: Rebirth</a>, but it's good. Sometimes the scene is brighter and more vivid than the darker story would lend itself to, but remains pretty well done. The only irritating things are optional conversations that, instead of being rendered with the game engine like other videos, have poor talking portraits and text.
Graphics: 6.8/10

The sound effects all seem appropriate, doing a good enough job of putting you in the setting without annoying you. Music, sound effects, and voicing can all be independently altered at will. The dialog is fair in times when it does show (some 'skit' or conversations have no audio voicing), and characters banter wittily after battle which will have you chuckling after the sometimes-frequent battles.
Sound: 7.6/10

The music you'll hear in the game has a deep and epic feel to it, always fitting with the emotional tones of the scene it goes to whether exposure of a threat to the world or two characters goofing off and chasing each other around to blow off steam. Strangely, I thought the peppy pop music in the introductory title was the worst in the game (it seemed so contrary to the depth of the game). The overworld theme is one of my favourite, with a darker tone matching the looming burden the characters bear while also portraying their determination to see their conflict through and their people to safety.
Music: 8.4/10

Movement across the overworld is passable, though the camera moves far too slowly for my taste. While it's virtually impossible to run from fights, you also gain 'TP' just by attacking and winning battles, so you're encouraged (nay, required) to level grind. Combat itself is neither turn-based like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atelier-Iris-Eternal-Mana/dp/B000784XEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atelier Iris Eternal Mana</a>, nor real-time like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-XII/dp/B000F5IH2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy XII</a>; it's real-time and using skills can take valuable charge time which adds a tactical element, it starts off like a side-scroller until you learn the 'skill' to use the L2 to freely move. Fortunately, allies and enemies don't typically act so constrained so the battles don't have the pinched sort of flow that earlier games like Dragon Quest did.
Gameplay: 7.6/10

You gain no special rewards for beating the game besides the end credits, and while there is a sort of New Game Plus, you have to buy elements (like pointless 'titles'), gold and experience multipliers for next play-through, and you can't even keep useful items like weapons or Artes. With such woefully poor 'rewards', I can't even call it a real option. While the rest of the game was good, the promise of being able to re-play was pretty much burned by what you actually got.
Replayability: 3/10

While I was annoyed at the lack of a true New Game Plus, others may be more used to only playing through their games once. For that, this is a good game that, while with its flaws (missing voicing, sluggish camera), will still probably prove a rewarding experience with a few laughs for people who have any interest in either the series or the broader JRPG genre.
Overall: 7.0/10"
2428,3,"I bought this stand and cradle set for my Wii U gamepad (because I bought the Wii U basic set). I think this cradle and stand are very convenient for placing your gamepad in an upright position. This way, it doesn't take as much as space, especially in a cramped room, as opposed to placing it on a flat surface.

 The cradle and stand are lightweight and portable. My only gripe is: I've noticed on several occasions that whenever I charged my gamepad using the cradle, it would periodically stop charging. I'd have to pick up the gamepad and place it on the cradle or move it slightly leftward/rightward in order to get it charging again.

It usually takes about 2-3 hours to charge my gamepad, but given how unreliable the cradle charger is, it sometimes takes longer than that because I'd find that it stopped charging. Nowadays, I just charge it without using the cradle charger (and use the cradle as a stand). I'm happy with the stand, but not thrilled with the idea of having an unreliable charger. For this reason I gave it a 3 star rating."
2429,3,"I really think this one could have been almost 5 stars if not for the glitches (which are often). The glitches: sometimes the game freezes, the audio gets messed up, wrestlers freeze up. The most frequent glitch is blocking and the opponent staggers as if he has been hit.

The roster is awesome. Includes Sting, Diamond Dallas, Rowdy Piper, Hogan, Andre the giant, Sid, Macho Man, Ultimate warrior, Jake the Snake, Bruno Samartino, the legion of doom, the steiner bros, the nasty boys, the million dollar man, king kong bundy, Iron Shiek, Mr Perfect, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, British Bulldog, Superstar Billy Grahm, George the animal steele, Bob backlund, killer kowalski, rick martel, tito santana, hacksaw jim duggan, Texas Tornado ""Kerry Von Erik"" and more! The game does not use authentic entrance music, but tries it's hardest to compensate. Mr Perfects music is almost the same.

If your a big fan of the classic wrestlers this game is worth buying for a cheap price, but chances are you will have a hard time getting your friends to play.

2430,3,"Is it me or is anyone else getting tired of the method in which Enix has released this series?  I do not understand why this series has to jump between different consoles and make giant leaps in game play.  It's almost enough to draw more people away than to bring them in IMO.
Did I enjoy the card deck method?  Yes.  I felt it added some creativity and actual strategy and made the extra work enjoyable when you acquired cards that would increase the strength in your deck.  The idea that the cards were memories reinforced the theme of Castle Oblivion.  It does take some getting used to, but once you find the method of card stacking to create powerful sleighs, you will be entertained by the fresh approach.
The major concern I had with the game is repeating the same worlds as KH1 and KH2.  There is no new areas, except if you include Castle Oblivion's tired repeated look on every floor.  I have to mention that once I finished Sora's story, I only played 10 minutes of Riku's.  I had no interest to repeat the same repetitive storyline again.
There is a part of me that thinks Enix Square is throwing this series on all different low graphic consoles b/c they are not taking this series as serious as they should.  It gives them an excuse to re-use tired old worlds and add nothing new to the series.  I find it evident in this game and in 358/2 days."
2431,3,"This game has it's flaws, but makes up for it with the fact that it is actually fun to play and has beautiful detail all throughout.  The maps are replicas of actual cities composed by walking photogrophers that had to take 90,000 shots of each city!  The major downfall in this game is the control, mainly for on foot play.  It is very difficult to aim your gun accuratley and sometimes impossible to make smooth runnings around corners and between obstacles.  Although, after playing a while you get used to it.  Bad controls in a game are like a woman; you have to take time to learn how to touch right to make things go the way you want them to.  As far as driving controls, they run a lot smoother.  The downfall to driving is that there are only 2 camera angles to choose from.  I like to play car games witht the camera far back but you cant do that in this game.  You have the standard view and the first person view.
I would like to point out some of the other things said by other reviewers.  There are complaints that the game is too hard and frustrating.  Also that the enemies don't duck down or move out of the way.  First, if the game was easy then it would be totally boring.  If you are chasing someone down and he gets away you have to start over.  For me this just makes it more intense.  After trying for the 5th to 10th time to get this guy I am totally enwrapped and thirsty for victory; and it tastes sweet.  But I guess I just don't throw baby fits when things get rough.  The enemies in this game DO duck down and move out of the way.  Although they are easy to defeat, this games challenge is ALL in the driving!  The A.I. is actually done well.  When redoing a chase I was, at first, expecting to just memorize the path the car moves down but to my suprise they make sudden, unexpected, turns.
The story mode is fun to play and the ""take a drive"" mode is the staple of the 'Driver' series.  It fun to just explore these beatifully detailed cities!  There is really quite a lot of detail.  Overall, Driv3r is actually a very fun game to play.  It is visually stimulating and engaging.  It presents a real challenge.  The major downfall is the poor control and that reallly should have been worked out."
2432,3,"You know it is not ok when you take a recently published game's disk out of the box and wait 3 or more hours to download content online! The new game requires a huge update, and remastered one is not even on the disk, 40gb+ download required. Studios do these so they don't have to games finished by the time they release to production on the customers expense.my downloads on a 100gig cable internet took so long xbox went to sleep twice"
2433,3,"Fun turn-based strategy game.  I think the PS4 graphics are wasted on it, though.  Looks like a PS2 game.  Cutscenes are short and forgettable.  Levels are pretty much all difficult until you learn the strategy, and even then most take hours and hours to complete.  At $15, I think this game is still too expensive.  Definitely would be worth it for $10.

You really learn as you go with this game.  Tutorials are not very helpful.  They tell you at the beginning of the game that if you can't complete a level it's your fault for not paying attention to these tutorials.

I did have a serious glitch on level 5 which caused me to almost give up on the game.  Somewhere around turn 35 I made a bunch of moves and did a bunch of damage to the enemy units, then after my turn was complete the game switched to the AI's turn and the computer didn't make any moves.  You could still scroll around the field of battle but the game would not progress.  After doing this turn over and over, it seemed that sinking a half dozen or so enemy ships at once was causing the glitch.  I had to redo my turn and not sink as many ships and finally the computer was able to finish its turn.  No glitch since.

I'm still not finished with the game but I am making progress.  I might actually be able to finish the game with 100% of the trophies unlocked, which I've never done on any game.

If you like old-school turn-based military strategy games you should like this, but don't pay too much.  There is little reward for your efforts as far as cool cutscenes or a good story."
2434,3,"Everybody knows the halo games and how popular they are. This is one game that both really impressed me and really let me down.
The campaign to this one is awesome, I enjoyed every bit of it. From the story line, to the graphics and all the way down to the spartan abilities. This game even works really well with the elite Xbox controller. So the campaign alone gets 5 stars
The multiplayer however is dificult for somebody who can't dump an entire magazine into another spartan without missing some shots. I'm really not a fan of how the halo games and call of duty games are becoming so similar to each other. I want to play a game that is unique. The multiplayer gets 2 stars.
The collectors aspect is lacking a bit and maybe it's just my own weirdness that is taking away from this swag. When I buy a collectors version of anything, I expect a physical copy of the game. I pay extra to have a physical statue so why not throw in a game disc?  Unlike halo reaches statue this one is height weight and hollow. It squeaks and rattles a bit when you pick it up. So maybe not something you want to handle as much as the halo 3 collectors helmet. The metal earth thing isn't interesting in the slightest. So sorry I have every collectors edition of all the halo games, this one is the only I didn't enjoy one star"
2435,3,"There are some things that don't need to be replaced or improved with technology.  Sitting on the bed with a child reading together from a colorful storybook, making up voices for the characters and talking about the scenes in the pictures, is one of them.

That is the experience that ""Storybook Workshop"" is attempting to replicate.  There are sixteen stories overall, both familiar and not, coming from a variety of cultures.  The parent and child (or child alone) read through the stories using a microphone, and the child can collect stickers for successful completion of a story.

Some of the features are pretty cool.  The ability to record the story and then listen to your own voice was a hit with my four-year old niece, as was the voice-changer that accompanied some of the stories (although this wasn't available in the play-back).  If your child isn't a reader yet, you can listen to a storyteller tell the story and try and follow along with the on-screen text.  Obviously the mini-game of being able to scream into the microphone in order to splatter paint on the screen was a hit.

I wasn't too impressed by the graphics, which were far inferior to your standard picture book.  The Wii remote use was limited; the child can ""grab"" some of the pictures to advance them to the next stage instead of pressing the A-button.  I was hoping that the Miis would be more involved, and that there would be some more interaction, but the Miis can only join in after a story has been completed three times, and then they only substitute for another character.

The selection of stories was nice, and I especially appreciated the inclusion of the Japanese tale of ""Hats for Jizos,"" which is one of my favorites.  Most of the stories are familiar favorites, with the Norwegian  folk tale ""The Boy who Went to the North Wind"" being the only one I was unfamiliar with.

Ultimately though, I just didn't like the barrier of reading fairy tales through the TV screen.  I would much rather sit her on my lap, set the big book in front of us and spend the time going through the story together.  That's what the picture on the front of the ""Wii Storybook"" game shows, and that experience is so much better than the game itself."

2441,3,"PROS:
-Comes with just about everything you need in terms of wiring
-Aesthetically pleasing, the blue glow is nice looking
-Easy hook up to PC/Mac

CONS:
-Too many wires needed to hook up to a game console
-Stereo output as opposed to true digital output
-Can't imagine anyone would spend the money on this when they could buy a decent pair of wireless surround headphones for the same price give or take

CONCLUSION:
I'm assuming that someone out there must be drooling over this thing, it's just kind of hard to imagine whom exactly. Also, console support seems like more of an afterthought when you consider what it takes to get it hooked up. I would recommend this to a PC/Mac user due to the ease of hooking it up but for a console user looking for surround sound options, I just don't see this making much sense as a purchase."
2442,3,"I really like the idea of a virtual cookbook, especially for the Nintendo DS. This ""game"" has a good variety of recipes and great explanations of ingredients and techniques. You can add your own notes to recipes and choose favorite recipes for quick access later, which is both innovative and helpful.

There are two problems with this game. The first is the voice-recognition, a great idea that doesn't work well in practice. Random sounds, such as a metal spoon stirring ingredients in a glass bowl, are recognized as speech commands, causing the game to repeat or skip instructions. The other problematic feature is the separation of ingredient amounts and instructions - unless you measure out all of the ingredients before cooking, you'll have to switch back and forth between ingredients and instructions.

Overall, this is an interesting idea, but unfortunately the problematic features detract from the overall experience."
2443,3,"I was very excited when I found out that PaRappa was coming to PS2. I thought it would be bigger, better and more difficult-- but it turned out that I was wrong. I was very disappointed to find that there are only 8 levels, all at pretty much the same difficulty level-- if you've beaten PaRappa 1 or UmJammer Lammy, you can probably finish this one within one sitting without any problems. Besides the easiness, there are other glaring faults: the storyline is incoherent and boring (everything is being turned into noodles, or something like that), and the lengthy movies between levels have bad translations and aren't very exciting. The actual songs are nowhere near as funny and clever as the original ones, and the paper-thin graphics, which were charming on the PS1, seem cheap and out of place on the PS2. After I beat the last level, I wished that I hadn't bought it-- it was just way too easy and unfulfilling. Also, while UmJammer Lammy unlocks tons of bonus levels after you finish, PaRappa2 has none. However, despite these faults, I would definitely recommend PaRappa2 as a rental to any PaRappa fan-- even if it is a waste to buy."
2444,3,"Its as close as you will get to something similar to the 360 controller, works fine with most games, some games still work better with the gamepad on the Wii U."
2445,3,"I think that if I hadn't used my trade in credit, I'd feel more frustrated about this game. The game has a premise that has been proven to entice & entertain via other games, but in the end this was just lackluster. AND overpriced.

Fast Food Panic follows two people (siblings? coworkers? lovers? the game never tells us) as they try to make their restaurant a success. Through various levels you'll help them go from a small shop to a five star restaurant & beyond. Putting meals together, helping to greet guests, chase mice, & deliver food are all parts of the main gameplay. There's also a series of minigames & a free mode.

I'll be honest- this game rips off from several games that are already out on the internet & on the DS & other consoles. Because I liked those games I did get some enjoyment out of this one, but it's kind of like drinking the store brand version of Coke or Pepsi. It's good, you don't hate it, but it just isn't the same. I went through the levels incredibly fast but there just didn't seem to be that much of a challenge. (Hint: unless you are 150% bad at games like this, playing at easy level is pretty much worthless- stick to the higher levels.)

Plus the controls are wonky. I've pushed icons, only to have nothing happen & some of the select & drag options for the game don't respond. I'll select the right item, drag it over to the food... and I'll get an error noise. Unless I line it up exactly right with the image on the food, it won't take it & I'll have an unhappy customer. If the game itself was better & had more than just a few recipes, I'd be able to overlook this but with all of the other stuff going on I can't help but get irritated.

This game isn't all bad- putting the meals together is fun & there's enough here to keep me involved. But at the prices it is currently at (twenty dollars here & at GameStop), I can't really recommend it all that highly. This is something that most will play for a few days then throw to the side or trade in so they can get one of the better clone games out there (or even the originals themselves).

If you don't have access to a computer or a good version of Cooking Mama & Dining Dash, then this will probably scratch that itch for a while. Just not long enough to really make it entirely worthwhile. I've had this game for less than 24 hours & I already know that I'm going to be trading it in to GameStop in about another week.

My recommendation is to borrow a friend's copy or wait until the trade in copies hit the shelf. It's worth playing a few times but in the end, this just isn't worth paying full price for.

EDIT:

I just wanted to add that after I beat the game, I ended up trading it in- which was 2 days after I'd purchased it. I'd have returned it sooner but I had to work.

This is a rental. Not a purchase. If you do buy it I don't recommend spending more than ten for it. It's just not that great. It's fun enough to play through once & putting the recipes together was fun, but other parts of the game (namely the thick as a brick waitress mini-games) were just annoying after the first 5-6 times she hollered for my help."
2446,3,"Game is fun but it's for little kids, the story makes no sense and the online multiplayer sucks even more"
2447,3,"When the XBOX first came out, I figured it would be a good competition for the PS2. Sadly, this is far from the truth. The PS2 automatically came with a working DVD player without having to buy an add on or attachment to play them.

Although on the plus side, it does make a very nice attachment. The device works really well and works just as good as if it were a DVD player. The remote is simple, not too fancy, and not much to memorize. The remote comes with a owners manual with instructions on how to use the device, in case you get stuck on how to use the device.

My only confusion about all of this is why do you have to buy an attachment when the device was already DVD ready to begin with. The answer is simple, to make you go out and purchase more XBOX items and give Microsoft more money. So, for those of you who were confused about why the DVD player wasn't working, this is your answer and this is the ONLY solution for it. You ""HAVE"" to buy the attachment to be able to play DVD's."
2448,3,"Having grown up playing the original SF, SFII in the arcades.. I've seen every iteration since then. This one definitely brought more to the table than the previous versions.

The good: all of the fun is online.
The Bad: All of the fun is online.

I liked single player, unlocking stuff, etc.. But where you end up getting your money's worth is online. What I don't like about that is that I don't really like playing online very often. Matchups are nice and easy, not that laggy.. But if you like to play solo or with friends in your living room mostly this game might end up collecting dust on your shelf.

The really bad: good god the intro and standard music is terrible and repetitive."
2449,3,"I expected this game to be great since the others were. Howver it changes too much about what was good. I mean the submission system sucks. When you tap the button to get the guy to submit it goes the opposite way and is hard to get them to submit. The submission system were a lot better in the last games and a lot less hard. I mean it's great that Bret Hart is on the game but I have a hard time getting people to submit as him. It's a hell of a lot easier for the computer to  get you to submit. I also don't like the controls in the Royal Rumble, it was much more easier to eliminate people in the last ones.

  Plus the story mode is a sorta lame too. It was better in the last when you could go on and play as someone else and all the stats and champions were kept the same. In this one it's like all your work in story mode means nothing unless you choose to continue as the same superstar. I  mean if you win the World title as Shelton Benjaman but don't choose to continue as him  then Randy Orton goes back as being World champ and you start all over. I think the Japan Pro Wrestling games had the right idea in their games. You could go for a belt or defend a belt anytime you wanted without a story mode. I've been waiting a long time for a WWE game like that. Plus ok it's cool that Legends like Bret Hart, Mick Foley and The Rock are on it. We don't need Piper, Super Fly or Brutis Beefcake though. If  Undertaker and Kane are on it you should be able to change their costumes to Legend Kane or Taker. Who needs them as legends, it's like a waste of space. They need to keep Bret as one on the next one and have Hogan, Jake the Snake Roberts, Ravishing Rick Rude, Psycho Sid, Stone Cold, and Yokozuna as well. Also you should be able to put Legends into Season mode. Plus if you make someone you should be able to have them in season mode without playing as them. I liked that in the other games. I also liked in the other games how you could play other matches besides your own too. You can't do any of that here and that makes it less fun.

  Also I don't like that there's no tag belts on it or the Cruiserweight title. The game has more wrestlers that were fired than wrestlers that are actually around now too. It needed La Resistance, Eugene, Maven, Tyson Tomko, Luther Reighns, Kenso Sesuki, Orlando Jordan, Heidenreich, the Basham Brothers and many others. Wrestlers like Chuck Palumbo, A-Train and Rico aren't even around now. Garrison Cade wasn't fired but he has been injured for the last 5 months, same with Matt Hardy. Also I don't like the on-line mode. It's useless for people who don't have it like myself. When you don't have it John Cena  just walks out looking dumb lip sinking with a mic in his hands. This Smackdown made too many changes and not many of them are that good. The last Smackdowns I could play without getting tired of them. I'm tired of this one already.... It had good graphics and decent match features and that's about all it has going for it."
2450,3,mypark is a joke they couldn't even design new courts and there is always issues with servers. gameplay is fun and graphics are amazing especially in nebula cam but hard to play with that camera.
2451,3,"Maybe it's just platformer fatigue... but if you have $20 and like platform games you would be better off purchasing Super Mario 3D World, Rayman Legends, or even Shovel Knight. I'm about halfway through the game and I just don't feel like it breaks any new ground. Overall, it is a good, challenging game. But it feels very hastily made with no regard for trying to use the technology of the Wii U or evolve the franchise. It is similar to New Super Mario Brothers U, a game that they had to add 'New' into the title to help people understand it was different than the one they had made years earlier for the Wii."
2452,3,"Ground and pound is the only way to end fights. The striking is a joke. You get ran through and your stamina dies quickly. They run combos like no other and always hit what you do not block. The submission is still stupid as h*** but its better. I have won one fight on my feet the rest I take them to the ground, mount, and finish. Otherwise I get knocked out."
2453,3,ITS A GARBAGE
2454,3,"this game is good, but just very small scale. if you're into huge MMO's like WoW or SW:TOR, i wouldn't recommend this game, because you'll get bored of it very fast.

this game is made for the VERY casual player, not an intermediate or hardcore player."
2455,3,"Worked, but not without causing major boot problems and DirectX problems possibly also! ..ONLY OK because it did work before I rebooted for the last time before having no programs to work now... sad. Shipment was done right and came with box btw."
2456,3,thank you
2457,3,"Great condition, but the children were quickly bored of the game, good thing summer holiday ends tomorrow."
2458,3,I enjoyed necronomicon. At times it was hard to hear the dialogue because the people either mumbled or talked to fast or soft. The graphics were good and the puzzles were not easy. The only thing i had to have help with was the correct urn. I just guessed any urn would due. I thought it was funny that in the town other than the fisherman nobody ever answered a door when i knocked. It is creepy like the 2 dracula games i played. Necronomicon is certainly harder than dracula -resurrection and a little bit harder than dracula-the last sanctuary. I thought the documents were complicated. If there is a negative to the game it is the overcomplicated documents.overall a good game.
2459,3,"I bought this thinking it would be a great game to test my strategy skills, while it is a fun game I wouldn't call it all that challenging. I just play it when I need to pass the time."
2460,3,"I got this game new for 5 bucks and it was well worth it, a fun fps that allows you to switch between the 2 characters at will which made the game a little more fun. you cant go wrong for 5 bucks"
2461,3,"My daughter enjoys the game, but it can be a bit dull."
2462,3,"I was once one of those kids who mastered Street Fighter II back in the day and kept going up to Super Street Fighter II. Being that the turbo edition didn't come out on the old SNES system during the time, I did get into Super Turbo and HD years later on PS3 and MAME. However I never kept up after a billion new versions of Zero, Aplha and crossovers spewed out of Capcoms production line and I switched to Mortal Kombat games instead.

I can't say I've played SF3 outside of a demo version, but I heard this one went back to SFII styles and stopped relying heavily on it being a button masher and brought back strategy. Which it has, however there has been quite a few things that I find with this game that make it irritating.

The graphics are ok, they are kind of a 3D yet somewhat drawn style. I got used to that quickly. But I do notice some characters look oddly different and don't match up. Rose for example looks like a smoothly polished polygon characters, where as others look like they where designed for a PS2 port of the game. The lack luster design of things also carries over to the backgrounds. It seems like hardly any effort was put into most of the backgrounds, creating a dull and boring feeling going into matches knowing what stage is next. Is this still the same guys who made the awesome background stages as SFII through to Super SFII Turbo? With the exception of T.Hawks stage, every stage in those games looked great and completed... where as this game is screaming out for 3D renditions of the old SFII stages with what lackluster effort has gone into the stages created here.

The moves work fine, in fact I actually really like the idea now that R1 is Strong Punch, and R2 is Strong Kick, and L1 and L2 are LP+MP+HP/LK+MK+HK,,, even tho I made the transition into the 3 punches or kicks easily in Super Turbo, I have found this configuration quite easy to adapt to and alternate nicely between the two without having to hold all 3 buttons at once.

The supers and ultras I find are pretty easy to get used to... even learning new ones like Akumas unique way of doing them was easy to master and I can't say anything bad about the controls. They work just as good as SFII ever did.

I can't say the same with the character choice tho. Whats the deal with having 25 characters and most of them are RYU clones? How many characters do we really need that have a ""fireball"", ""dragon punch"" and ""hurricane kick"" variation? Really... 6.5 characters are almost the same, witch just one move to separate them apart? Come on, even Mortal Kombat never went the route of having excessive numbers of Sub Zero and Scorpion like moves for individual characters. Tho they are guilty of palette swapping the same character, which this game has done a 3D version and has too many RYU tops with different heads on them.

The new characters I have not found enjoyable. Abel looks like Ryu in soccer shorts and is an annoying AI on hard modes and almost useless to have any fun with. The luchidore wrestler El Whats-his-name is surely going to be one of the most hated SF characters of all time. Who had the stupid idea to make a hyper active Rey Mysterio cartoon like character who runs around and has aback story of he has entered the tournament to ask the worlds strongest fighters what they eat, because he is also a chef?
The fat guy is the biggest joke of the game. For one his AI is too easy to beat him, probably because his moves are useless, but his bobbing around gut makes him look like a stupid cartoon character catered only as a joke for Eastern world players to laugh and say ""Fat American Slob Character"". The other two are useless too.

I think Aksura or whatever her name is comes from a previous SF game. She's pretty much RYU in a dress. Her backstory is pathetic that she's RYU's biggest fan. In fact, I must say, the entire story of both beginning and end shown for each character in this game is absolutely pathetic. There where dumb reasons they join the tournament, and even dumber endings that satisfy no one. Did Capcom ask a work experience kid to throw these things in as an after thought or something? It was also a pleasure to watch the endings of SFII games... but now, they are a joke. They make little to no sense for the most part and seem more like they where 2 seconds of a full length movie that was never released. They are as bad as when you come to your second last fight and it says ""now face your rival"" and it shows a small interaction of something stupid like the Ryu obsessed fan girl all excited to be friends and will fight you and then go have dinner when its over... huh?????? I know Capcom doesn't want to be as violent as Mortal Kombat, but seriously? They meet, they fight, loser buys dinner? COME ON. lol

The game features Arcade Mode. And a few hundred challenge things. The challenges range from gauntlet, time attack and something else. These are OK at first but as the difficulty rises, so does your blood pressure. I found myself annoyed at the stupid AI difficulty all just to unlock a stupid pose i don't care about or alternate colors for the characters. I just cannot be bothered trying to master it just for colors and things I will never use.

There is also online mode. You can create a lobby, or, if you don't know how to turn it off, can become annoyed by playing arcade and are just about to win when ""A NEW PLAYER HAS ENTERED THE TOURNAMENT"" and then some random online player becomes your next match. A ""Do not disturb"" option would have been great instead of having to just sign out of the PSN network to avoid it.

There is icons or a shirt of something dumb you can unlock that does nothing if you win a million online matches... seriously, its 300 matches or something? Yeah, no thanks Capcom. I think I'm done with this game now. Hasn't been a week yet and I might pass it onto someone else or trade it in. Its also left me with no interest in checking out Super edition 4 or Ultra Champion Hyper Blubba Bob Editions either.

It's been an OK game, but so many stupid ideas and irritating AI difficulty ruined it. The only decent challenge would be to compete online against others and see how good I really am... however, i'm 3 wins 1 loss... due to connection issues and players dropping out of challenges. Unless you have a friend who is reliable to play against, don't bother with the online stuff. Someone either rage quits or runs away after one victory.... thats IF you can connect to each other and play at all. P.S Load times really gave me a headache. lol"
2463,3,"This game looks very good and is very differnt than anything I have ever played. However, it gets boaring very quickly. The only thing that could maybe save this game is free DLC but looks like that will be a long way off and not free."
2464,3,But my kids are happy so it's fine. I won't be spending any length of time playing this game though. The announcer is supremely annoying and the games are not as entertaining as I recall the first games were. Although the option to practice the game before playing it for real is a great addition.
2465,3,It's ok.
2466,3,"If you're not familiar with beta testing, it's a process where gamers test and play the game before it is released.  I beta tested the game up until a few days before its release and while I thought Dark Age of Camelot was a decent game I wasn't overwhelmed by it.
First off, Dark Age of Camelot is an online multiplayer game and it seems to be more stable than some of the recent disasters that have been released.  One disclaimer to this is that I experienced bad lag (pauses or slow gameplay due to slow internet signals) in the major cities in the last days of beta testing because more beta testers were allowed in the game which makes me think that when the game is released it will only get worse.  If you're going to purchase Dark Age of Camelot I would check recent news and PC game bulletin boards to see if the company's servers are holding up and the game isn't experiencing too many bugs.
The graphics are definitely impressive and I would compare it to the game Asheron's Call with better resolution.  As a matter of fact, the game plays similar to Asheron's Call with a set of rules resembling Baldur's Gate or any Dungeons & Dragons PC games.
While the game looks to be stable and takes advantage of better graphics than most online games it just doesn't seem to offer much.  After picking a server to play on, you also pick a realm to play in which affects what type of races you can play.  Some of the races are large creatures such as trolls or small creatures like kobolds and are a nice change from the usual formats for swords & sorcery online games.  After the races though, the choice of professions for your character are very limited.  Essentially, you can only be a warrior, mage, thief or cleric with subtle distinctions occuring as you reach higher levels and are able to swear to different gods in the game who give you special abilities.
I didn't enjoy the setup for gameplay.  Many easy actions such as simply quitting the game require you to type in a command.  I felt the chat options were more technical than they needed to be and the chat box wasn't large enough to begin with.  Your actions are also recorded in the chat box and the game seems to be more oriented for the keyboard than the mouse.
It's fun to see some of the warrior classes allowed minor spells at higher levels but the spells that are provided don't match some of the online competitors's games.  The quests and adventures provided are difficult to find and most cities are very small.  It's almost like the game was perfected to look ""pretty"" while forgetting vast quests, subplots, NPC activity and other elements that make many online games enjoyable for months.  Also, if you are a gamer than enjoys playing solo, this might not be the game for you because it's oriented for group play with some clever options put in such as screens that allow you to find any players in your region that are seeking companions.
I would give the game a try to see if you enjoy it but in my opinion, it doesn't match up to Ultima Online, Asheron's Call or Everquest."
2467,3,"NBA LIVE has a better playcalling system, drops down on the break really easy that's my favorite new edition, outside of LIVE 365.  But LIVE 365 has a dark shadow across it, because the gameplay is still not up to par with NBA 2K9, not even close guys.  This game is easy as pie to pick up and play.  Online is pure garbage still straight dunking, but the connection is great and the game lobbies are great.  The pick and roll mechanic is nice.  The cut scenes are really nice, the menus are great, the game modes are nice, but the graphics stink, and the player animations are terrible, so unatural, players move liek drunk sailors trying to dance at a disco.  Defending the dunk is near impossible to defend.  NBA 2k9 wins easily as the bball game of the year, this is the first time I crossed to 2K9, NBA LIVE gets a 6/10 from me.  NBA 2K9 is maybe the best bball game ever a 9/10, only thing 2k9 lacks is game lobbies."

2469,3,"Not pushing any boundaries in graphics or story, however still good co-op hack n slash game that my 4 year old son could play and enjoy with me."
2470,3,"The reason it's over priced is because it is being sold by a third party and not Amazon directly. As for the unit itself, I already have a Wii U and am glad I didn't get this one. Not because I don't like the Wii U, I love it, it gets played more than my PS4 or Xbox (because I love the Mario and Zelda games, the only reason I own Nintendo consoles). But I don't like digital downloads. I see no point in them as it seems they make you do more work (IE have to delete games to download more games once you fill up the hard drive and have to redownload those games if you want to play them again. If you have bad internet, expect to take a while to download any game).

The Splatoon game itself is awesome (from what I have seen, I haven't got it yet) and Nintendoland is good if you have more than one player (you need friends and or family for that game). As others have said, the unit itself is no different. No design differences at all. Same thing you get from previous Wii U bundles (except the Zelda one with the special controller). Unless you don't have a Wii U and don't mind digital games, this is NOT a must buy, at least from third parties that charge too much over retail price."

2475,3,"The game itself is great but to get the game to start and run is a nightmare. After installation all I got was that it was initializing. It was waiting for the Social club to give my computer the go ahead to run the game. It said I needed an internet connection and Explorer and Chrome and my email were always working fine. Anyways, After fighting this for a day I finally was able to put in my ""code"" by starting it in safe mode and then I had to run renderer.exe before I hit the Enter button and social club then asked for my code. I entered it and then I was able to play. The next time I played I started the game in the regular mode by using the renderer.exe trick. Unfortunately this does not always work and I find myself rebooting my computer till I can get the game to run. It is way too much of a pain and frankly I wonder where Rockstar is about all this. So many people are having this problem and they do not seem to be even be alive. They obviously are not reading the reviews or even reading their support emails. I got almost through the whole game and I will give up, so, I think I will stock this one in my old game box and move on. It is much too aggravating."
2476,3,"No Wow-Pow, but cool outfit."
2477,3,"We love Wii games which make us get up and move and have fun. We just bought this game and I can't say we are impressed at all. The ""how to play"" indicators are confusing and don't tell you ALL of what you need to do for each challenge. Some of the games are rather boring. This just isn't as good as we expected. Outdoor challenge and Monkey Ball Super Banana Blitz or Rayman Rabbids 2 are still more fun if you want an ""active"" game."
2478,3,"For me, the PS2 version of Twisted Metal Heads On was the BEST Twisted Metal I ever played since TM2. When I first heard that Twisted Metal was comming to PS3 I went CrAzY! But when I played this game I was SOOOO DISSAPPOINTED!! :(

Here are the pros:

* More weapons and even two Special attacks. WOW!
* You can use flying vehicles. COOL!
* Live-Action cinematics. I LOVE THAT!
* You can modify your car.
* Huge stages.
* Giant bosses.
* Dark stories and settings.
* Great multiplayer mode.

Now the cons:

* AWFUL controls, unlike the previous games.
* There are ony 3 or 4 characters, they are the ones who drive all kinds of vehicles.
* Bad graphics.
* Bad sound.
* There isn't THAT much massive destruction, unlike TM2 and TM Heads On.
* Having to race or follow certain rules to win can be VERY ANNOYING! I rather play that in a challenge mode instead of a story mode.
* Sometimes the game can be TOOO HARD. And I don't think that hard games necessarily makes the gameplay better.
* The only character that we are all familiar with is Sweet Tooth, the other ones are completely unknown and uninteresting.

Even when I have to admit that this game is quite enjoyable the production was pretty cheap. But what can we expect from most games that are made specifically for multiplayer? I hope that SONY will release both TM Heads On and TM Black in one HD disc soon. That would be cool.

Adios"

2481,3,"Being a fan of Zombie flicks and the ""Resident Evil"" francise I naturally thought ""dead Rising"" would be a great game to pick up. It turns out that in essence I was right. Dead Rising is driven by a classic plot, numerous and humorous ways to dispose of your undead foes, and enough quests to keep you playing. But unfortunately I've never played a game that showed so much promise yet be so riddled with problems. First, If you don't own an HDTV you're out of luck. The text is so tiny that you won't be abble to read anything unless you have a 100x microscope. The problem is, alot of the plot and directions to quests are convaied though the text. If you can't read it then you just might be SOL. The biggest problem is the save system. To save your game you have to go to a bathroom or find a place to sleep. In the whole mall there are maybe five or six of these places, each of them considerable(Zombie infested) distances from each other. The quests are also timed. If you start a quest and you're really far a away form it or can't find it on time. You're doomed. If you miss a main quest the game ends and you need to start all over. Even if you're about to finish the game you have to start from the beginning. The basics are in place for a great game but the mechanics are horrible. Rent it. Don't buy it."
2482,3,"I bought this version of the game, and I am quite happy that I did. However, I also didn't mind spending a few extra bucks, and I like Star Wars. When I really look at what I got, it wasn't a whole lot to be honest.
There is the actual game (which is great and I rated a 5... but that's for the regular version, not the collectors edition). Then, you get a silly little figurine, which resembles a 2 inch silver toy solder from space. Not very exciting. You can hardly tell what it is. The back of the manual has the signatures of the most important developers printed on (not my cup of tea, really, but if it gets you excited...). There are a few minor things, like a Star Wars pin I believe.
The only thing that is any good here is the ""Art of Star Wars Galaxies"" book. This is pretty cool (and apparently can't be purchased elsewhere). But whether or not it is worth 30 bucks more than the regular version is up to you to decide..."

After two DAYS searching the reviews on every site i could find, searching the web for any page that might mention if it does or not, looked at the few videos i could find........ I STILL had no clue. I finally got in contact with PDP this morning, and the guy went to find out for me while i was on hold. I guess they had one of sony's chargers there or he had to find someone that actually knew? I don't know, but for those wondering like i was whether or not this wireless controller is close enough to sony's in dimensions that it'll work with sony's charging stand....

IT WON'T WORK  :( bummer.....  but this review's a head's up for anyone wondering the same thing.

I was at gamestop later today and looked at these controllers, then came home and looked at my sony that came with the PS3. The top where the charging cable goes (or in the case of sony's stand.. the thing that clips on the controller to transfer power while in the stand) is definitely quite a bit ... bigger (or wider or w/e) then Sony's. So ya head's up, unless you dont' mind a 8 foot usb cable across the floor don't bother getting this (unless you have a charging stand already for these controllers.)

Granted the thing's supposed to work for 15 HOURS before u need to charge it, but if you're like me and sometimes FORGET to charge it (leave it laying on the desk) you'll have a cord acros the floor anyway. But if you're like me and already have sony's charger, if you get this you'll have the cord across the floor all the time anyway (cause it won't work in Sony's stand), not just when you forgot to charge it. So.... basically, just get sony's controller for a 2nd/backup."
2487,3,OK game.
2488,3,"This game is fun in a Grand Theft Auto type way, but in this game you can throw cars and air conditioning units. It's a fun time-waster. You can, just like GTA, accidentally spend a long time just screwing around and throwing cars into crowded streets. This game is also very reminiscent of the Spiderman 2 game because of the open NYC environment where you can climb all the skyscrapers of New York.

This brings me to the negative part of my review. Climbing skyscrapers and buildings in general proves difficult at times. It DEFINITELY takes getting used to and even after your used to it, you'll have moments when you're trying to get to the top of a building to get a ""Landmark Collectible"" and you just grate your teeth and getting angry because you basically have to get lucky in order to do it. In some of the missions the touchy controls can prove to be a hinderance as well. There's times that you need to be stealthy, so as to not alert the enemy, and if you don't hit the buttons the EXACTLY right way, you'll set off all sorts of alarms and probably lose the mission (especially if it's a stealth-dependent mission). The missions are easy compared to the challenges. Now, I know that some they are called ""Challenges"", therefore they are supposed to challenge you. But when your characters athletic abilities are limited by his glitchy movement, it's hard to do anything in a short span of time and do it correctly. It's almost impossible to get Alex (your Player Character), to go the exact direction you want him to when he's not already moving. If you're coming out of a dead stop, you'll probably go right when you want/need to go left (and vice versa).

Next up is another flaw: The Story. The story, while intricate and complex, is dull and unoriginal. Imagine 28 Days Later meets Rambo. Essentially just a parasitic zombie virus story. I won't give any spoilers, but just know to expect your typical plot elements of a militaristically-focused zombie movie. It's also a very thinly veiled extended metaphor for the AIDS epidemic. I won't make all the numerous connections to this metaphor, but if you look for it, it's pretty hard to miss. And the ending? ""Disappointment"" would be an OK word to use, I suppose.

All in all, it's an ok game. I hope that in the sequel they work on the control scheme and improve the relationship between what you press/move on the controller and what happens on-screen. But I don't anticipate much improvement on the low quality of the plot coming from these companies. Not worth the original price, but since it's been discount down to a really low price, I'd say if you're looking for a fun game with cheap thrills, and big, dumb action and a story to match that action for a decent price, look no further."
2489,3,"The Evil Dead films have--with good reason--a dedicated fan following, and a video game tie-in seemed like a logical choice. If you like the films, then you will probably like this game. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, the Boomstick-slinging, chainsaw-wielding hero of the films with an axe to grind (literally) and Deadites to kill. The premise is very simple: Armed with his trusty chainsaw, Boomstick, spells, and a quip-spouting mouth, Ash must must travel through time to various points in Dearborn, Michigan's past and accomplish certain goals that will stop the Deadites from overrunning the Earth.
The Good: Action, action, action. Deadites are everywhere, constantly on the attack. Bruce Campbell has a number of great one-liners, and his vocal work and self-deprecating humor makes the more tedious parts of the game pass more easily. The game has an Mature rating, and with good reason: Ash hacks Deadites apart with his chainsaw, sending limbs and heads flying everywhere and blood spurting ten feet into the air. He blasts them into a fine red mist with his shotgun, and cooks them with his flamethrower. Definitely not a game for the kiddies. Controls are decent, though Ash seems to have trouble outrunning Deadites, who shamble and shuffle along. I especially like the two-handed attacks Ash can execute, such as using the chainsaw and shotgun simultaneously. You can also cast spells, such as ""Possess Deadite"" and a great lightning spell that add to your arsenal and allow you to work through some areas more easily.
The Bad: Constant Deadite regeneration. Just when you think you've cleared an area of Deadites, they respawn. This makes backtracking very, very difficult, as enemies keep respawning every time you pass through an area. This makes game progression difficult at times. Also, there never seems to enough health. I've killed literally dozens of Deadites and only been rewarded with one or two bits of health.
There are also too many cutscenes, and most of them cannot be skipped. it's annoying to face a boss character, get killed, and have to sit through the introductory clip again and again without being able to skip it. There are also too few save points. Constantly replaying the same areas again and again gets old after a while.
Graphics are subpar, but Ash at least LOOKS like Bruce Campbell, and the blood and atmospheric effects are adequate. The camera angle can be a real aggravation at times. I had to rotate it way too often to get my bearings, a problem commonly found in third-person games.
The Ugly: The Deadites. Nuff said.
A tip or two: Save devastating weapons, such as explosive shells, armor-piercing bullets, or the flamethrower for crowds of Deadites. When faced with that many enemies, your trusty chainsaw won't be able to mow them down fast enough to keep you from being surrounded. Single Deadites are usually best dispatched with your chainsaw. Also, when the music begins to quicken, that's a hint that Deadites are approaching. The game also has some good unlockable arcade levels, usually accessed by killing X number of Deadites in X amount of time.
Not a perfect game by any means, but for twenty bucks or so, a pretty worthy purchase."
2490,3,"This game is alright... it has its ups and downs. First off I had to go and buy a whole new video card just to run it. There is a specific list of video cards on the back of the packaging... make sure you check it, and your video card is listed on there, otherwise, there's a very good chance it's not going to run on your system. After I upgraded my video card, it ran excellent. I was told this would be a WoW clone, and graphics wise it is, only with a little better water effects, shadowing engines, and just more realistic character details. The terrains and zones look very similar thoguh.  If your computer can handle it it looks great, they didn't try to be quite as realistic as Everquest, so it doesn't look extremely fake, and they didn't go so cartoony as WoW so its a good mix of both, and looks really good.

Gameplay, I didn't like as much. WoW incorporates an open, free roaming world, that means go anywhere, do anything, whenever you want. this game does not. The zones are broken down into the two realms at battle and the level tier you are, and there's a set path up and down through each. Its a straight line up and down through the zones. Therefore your starter area and the next 2 zones are almost purely your race, and your race alone. So making a good skilled group in certain races is difficult because they don't all feature a tank class. The zones all culminate in the major cities, but that makes it so that all the dungeons, lairs, and senarios are controlled by an NPC in a major city or town. You can't just stroll across a dungeon entrance in this game you have to go to an NPC and ask to access it. In my opinion i kind of like having to actually physically GO TO a dungeon to get in, not just automatically be teleported in and out, and be done with it. Gettin there and back is half the fun.

The armors are extremely customizable, and the weapons look good. The item drops are usually crap though (at least in the first 10 levels) lots of seeds, and weeds, and non-useful items. You come across a decent weapon or armor piece every now and then, but not too often.

Overall, in my opinion it ended up costing too much money to play it because of the upgrade needed. In my opinion after years of World of Warcraft... it doesn't measure up. I don't think it's going to compete with current MMORPGs, except amoung true gamers, because of the system requirements, and the fact that WoW is bigger, with better, easier to follow gameplay, and much nicer system requirements for the NON-gamer communities.

This MAY help keep those 12 year old kids hogging up the servers on WoW OUT of WAR though ;-). Or at least we can hope so. I know WAR is just in the beginning phases though, so I'm gonna stick it out. It'll just take a little getting used to... and a few upgrades, and patches, and it should be good to go..."
2491,3,"I don't know what the developers were thinking, but you Cant Die.
You can get shot to sh*t a million times, and never actually Die, nor have to restart the level.

There's only 1 level you can screw up on, to fail the Mission, and have to start over...
...FROM THE BEGINNING (which was stupid) - no checkpoints.... that's Double Stupid.

In 1 level, you have to shut some radiation-leaking boxes, then leave the bunker.
When outside, you have to close the door. Well, I got shot while closing the door...
...and I got glitched back inside the Bunker. I couldn't get out, because of Poor Developer Thinking.

And this game wasn't very popular to begin with, so it's not like you can report the issue...
...so that a Patch can be made, to prevent it in the Future.

The Voice Actors were damn-close to the Actual Movie Actors voices.
The 3D Modellers did a nice job recreating Tony Starks Garage (for the cutscene)  ***you do not get to walk around his garage***

You get to play as Mark 1, Mark 2, Mark 3 Movie Armors. And like 3 or 4 Comic Book armors.
You get to fight Iron Monger at the end, which was cool, but nothing else was Movie-related."
2492,3,"I was hoping that this would be a game with a lot of replay-ability and what I got was a game that, once you learn it, just becomes tedious.

Once you figure out what you need to do to get your civilization going, it's a matter of building the same city the same way over and over.

And, it didn't take me long to find an approach to beating the computer that the AI couldn't cope with.  I suppose this game would be a lot more fun to play against other humans, but you'd think that in this age of 2 gig and faster processors these game manufacturers would be able to build a game where the computer could really think out some challenging tactics.  Not in this game.

So, for me it was fun getting up the learning curve, but now it's boring and once I win the current game I'm playing, on ""tough"" mode on a ""big huge"" map, I plan to sell it used."
2493,3,didn't play.  Couldn't ride my horse to the bridge for 1 minute before it freezes.  Terrible shame.
2494,3,"This is for the 3DS - where there is no multi-player option.  AT:ETDBIDK is a game in the style of Gauntlet from years ago - you play a character going through dungeon levels, along the way unlocking additional characters to play.  Gauntlet was OK with one player, but was really meant to be played by you and a bunch of friends.

As for the good - there's voice acting from the original cast (BMO really makes it) - and sadly, that's about it.  For the first 20 levels it's fun(ish) - but it's soon apparent that other levels that could be passable with multiple players become near impossible on the 3DS where there's only you.

With no save option available until after every 5th level, and upgrades to your character quickly becoming too expensive (keep in mind any gold you earn doesn't carry over once you re-enter the dungeon - again, if there were multiplayers all collecting money during game play you might be able to purchase upgrades beyond the first thump token) this becomes an exercise in frustration.

Perhaps the other ports are good, but I'd stay away from the 3DS as it turns into an exercise in frustration.  The special edition DVD is fun as is the booklet - but they don't mask the fact that the game isn't what it should be for the 3DS.

Stick with ""Hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage"" instead."
2495,3,I bought this game because I loved the movie and I thought it world be like the movie. The game is kinda hard and took me forever to get past the Dracula Wives. I guess it just got boring after a while. I never play it anymore anyway.
2496,3,This is suppose to be a great game and if you can run it I believe it is. Unfortunately on my windows 7 computer with nvidia graphic cards it will not respond to the mouse. This is a system problem on my PC and not a defect in the game.
2497,3,"What the heck, you might ask: The game was recently released, I get only 10 fps with everything maxed out and you call it obsolete? That is my point exactly. You need to take a look under the hood to understand why you get such poor mileage.  Simply put, the game isn't designed to take advantage of multi-threading, ie it doesn't split tasks to run in parallel to take advantage of multi-core CPUs that we have today. FSX was designed in 03-04, when mainstream CPUs were in the MHz race. A few years later AMD and Intel dropped the clock speed factor in favor of multi-core architecture, but by that time FSX was well in implementation phase, and it was too late to change it. That is the reason you get slow FPS.  You can wait for 10,000Mhz CPU to improve things but don't hold your breath. SP1 improved it somewhat by multi-threading couple of tasks but MS was limited in what it could do with a finished product.

A word about graphics.  Many people were hoping for DX10 and Vista to improve things.  But, as MS team admitted, SP2 (DX10 upgrade) has barely any graphics improvements, so you'll be hard pressed to see the difference beteeen DX9 and DX10 graphics.  They claim, that DX10 pipeline improved framerates by 10-20% by offloading more tasks to video card, and you get better performance.  The problem is, DX10 runs only on Vista, and Vista is much slower than XP.  So you give up performance by upgrading from XP to Vista (bog down your CPU), then regain it back by using DX10 (offloading some tasks from CPU to graphics card).  At the end of this exercise you'll be left with basically same graphics/performance, at a cost of measly few hundred greenbacks.  MS claims the DX10 spec was raw when they were working on FSX, and other schedule constraints (such as Acceleration pack) let them pretty much drop any significant DX10 work.

So, at the and of the day, you're left basically with FS2004 graphics, poor framerates and nothing new and noteworthy.  Had they improved the flight model, that alone would have been worth the price of admission, but alas, we see more of the same: higher res textures, finer mesh, etc, all of which have been available for FS2004 for quite some time via commercial add-ons, without the performance penalty to boot.

Some philosophies advocate building classics: things that stand the test of time and get better with age.  Common philosophy these days it to build disposable items, from ligthers to automobiles that go out of fashion before you can count to ten.  MS has been a leader in building fad software.  This time they have outdone themselves: delivered a product that was obsolete on release and a lot more obsolete now, with DX10 features dropped.  The bug of technical progress bit them in the backside, hard.  So long, on to FS11."
2498,3,"Works great, would definitely recommend the one with more memory though."
2499,3,"Some of us, not having had enough of the special brand of pain developer From Software inflicts on us with the excellent action RPGs Demon's Souls & more recently, Dark Souls, may have gone searching for what came before.  Those that go searching generally find out about King's Field, but it is of the opinion of the author of this review that is in fact Shadow Tower, not King's Field directly, that is the direct precursor to the souls games, and in fact appears to be the missing link between the two (as opposed to the more recent Kings Field: The Ancient City)

Shadow Tower shares many traits with the souls games - namely - souls which you use to power up different stats.  There is also weapon breakage, a lack of background music (which adds to rather than subtracts from the oppressive atmosphere), Switchable primary and secondary left & right hand equipment, An enormously deep stat & equipment based system, a near total lack of exposition or hand holding, and a brutal difficulty.

Many of these traits are shared by the Kings Field games, along with the first person perspective & the slow, deliberate pacing of the game. But it is the genesis of the Souls games seen in the mood and mechanics of this game that give a preview of things to come.

Having said that, don't come into this game expecting the Souls games, this game is different. As stated, it's first and foremost a slow, first person, PS1 game, and not a AAA title by any stretch of the imagination.  This game was made using technology that was several years old at the time and showing it.  Despite being a 3D 1st person RPG and the dualshock controller existing at the time this game was released,  the analog sticks are completely unsupported and the control scheme is completely archaic, with strafing and look up/down controlled by the shoulder buttons of all things.  The game becomes dramatically easier for the modern gamer by remapping the controls so that strafing is done on the d-pad, look up/down/left/right is done using the face buttons, and the attack/action/menu buttons are mapped to the shoulder buttons. this provides something of a modern button layout, but take care not to die before you save after you do the remapping, or you'll have to do it all over again! Such is life in the Souls games, or their predecessors.

Combat in this game is decidedly tactical for a game that is nominally an FPS-RPG. Managing HP, Stamina, and MP is first and formost, followed secondly by position relative the enemies on the screen. After such considerations the next most important thing is the durability of your equipment, which breaks at the most inopportune times.  The level of detail and pacing in this game is more remenicient of a old-school PC RPG than a console action game.

In the end I'd say that this game is not for everyone. it's definitely got an audience, and if you like deep, thoughtful tactical RPGs with a slow pacing and minimal story line but lots of exploration and atmosphere, you will like Shadow Tower. If you like the Souls games, and can adjust to the Kings Field play style, you will also probably like Shadow Tower. If you like Skyrim you will not like Shadow Tower, and if you like Modern Warfare you are probably lost and should just click the back button on your browser.

This game gets points for giving a hint of the greatness to come, but it's hard to give this game a general recommendation outside of the specific audience described above."
2500,4,"Why so many people butt-hurt about the motion controls? Sure they're hard to get used to but they open up a lot more options for bombing runs, dogfights, etc.  There are legitimate gripes about this game: word-for-word banter from Star Fox 64, copied planet layout, and clumsy controls. That being said, the motion control set up does not make this a 1-star game as many people are posting.

It's not hard to move the aiming reticule while flying the Arwing (although precision is difficult) so there's less looking back-and-forth than I expected.  The BIGGEST and legitimate problem with the whole set up is that the lasers don't shoot where the reticule aims, there's some weird POV trajectory they take. It seems like the only reason for this is to make players look at the gamepad every now and then. Stupid stupid stupid, nintendo trying to force their scheme down our throat. My hope is a patch will change that problem but it's not likely.

The first level blew me away and took me back to 64. It's been a long time since I've had that experience. Even though the controls are awkward now, I think I'll get used to them. I'd say it's a solid 4-star game, with 5-star potential if some of the aiming problems are fixed.

...and yeah, you really need an option to turn off motion controls entirely. It would be so easy to do and then people would stop complaining about them."
2501,4,"Nintendo has had tremendous success over the last 18 or so years with the Gameboy franchise.  The gaming public has seen many versions of the Gameboy released during this period, and once again Nintendo has put out yet another winner in this product line.

The Gameboy Micro is simply a mini version of the Gameboy Advance.  Unlike the SP version, this one does not ""flip"" open to reveal the screen.  When they named it the ""Micro"" they hit the nail squarely on the head.  From what I have read, Nintendo was aiming to make the Gameboy a trendy ""tech"" item, one that would mirror the small design of today's mobile phone market.  They pulled this off; the Micro is about the size of a cell phone.  It is very sleek in design but also very simple.  Nothing is wasted; you have your basic command buttons and power/volume switches, and a plug-in for headphones.  That is about it aside from the plug-in for the charger.

The Micro will play all GBA games but not Gameboy Color games.

The screen clarity is a perfect 10.  Games look amazing on this little guy, and the colors jump right off the screen.  In my opinion this a feature that is worth the price of the Micro alone.  Also, the battery life is extrememly long.

From what I can tell, the most popular version of the Gameboy has been the SP.  As a result, many SP owners will be (rightfully) skeptical of the need to purchase a Micro since it is not an upgrade in terms of the games it plays.  It is still, at the end of the day, a GBA.  If you are looking for the best graphics then I would buy a DS Lite.

My only complaint is that sometimes the system feels almost TOO small in my hands.  Other than that, I would recommend this one to any Gameboy fan.  Very simple, excellent quality, and a HUGE library of games to choose from."
2502,4,good game
2503,4,"Tough and very durable cases. I have repeatedly switched them around and they have barely stretched. Skin feels very slippery however and I would not be surprised if it slips from someone's hand. Overall for the price 4.84 as an add on, it serves its purpose."
2504,4,excellent condition.
2505,4,"This is a fun game. I really liked the variey of weapons, vehicles, and environments. The negatives are the ""boss areas"" which take too many repitions to survive."
2506,4,"There are a bunch of lengthy reviews of these headphones, so I'll try to boil it down to a list of pros and cons based on my experience:

Pros:
- Very comfortable
- Solid sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but these sounds excellent to my uneducated ears.
- Excellent packaging.
- Independent game/chat volume controls.

Cons:
- Can't hear yourself talk. I know this may sound obvious for closed headphones/mic combinations, but I had only used open headsets before and it was very disorienting/weird.
- Game and chat volumes were tough to balance for me. It was hard to get a mix where I felt I was hearing both at an appropriate level. Maybe not specific to these headphones.

Also note that when you connect this headset it will require an update via Xbox One, so don't plug them in during the middle of a Titanfall match!"
2507,4,"Love the game thanks!
This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat. Thanks"

2510,4,"Ghost in The Shell is the first game based off of the Ghost in The Shell Manga and Cyberpunk movie series.

Plot: You are a rookie at Public Security Section 9. You pilot a Fuchikoma tank

Graphics: The Graphics are very colorful and work very well between area's from sewers to the city. 7/10

Sound: The soundtrack was very well placed and even got its own album Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body 7/10

Gameplay: From climbing buildings to fighting bosses the Gameplay is great and action packed. The downside is I hated the timed missions 8/10

Overall: it is very different than the shooters of the time as it was very different than Doom. This is a must have, for and Gits or 1st and 3rd person tank game fans alike. 7.75"
2511,4,Bought it for my brother.
2512,4,"I was so excited when I found out this game was coming to the wii and I finally got it last night!

All the graphics in this game are great except for the audience... it's very obvious that you see about 3 or 4 different people just placed over and over and over in the audience. The videos were a very nice touch, they're just a little small. It would be much nicer if they had been bigger. The sound is very well done and sounds exactly as it does on the show, from the theme song, to the wheel turning, and even the plinko chip falling. The AI is also good in this game, how your bidding affects other people's bidding in contestants row. It is nice how they included classic games, but I'm sure if they really wanted to, they could have included more games than the 16 that ended up on there. It also would have been nice if we would have had bob barker as the host, but we get no host at all! just the announcer who does pretty much everything. However, this doesn't take away from the fun, this is alot of fun to play especially if you have a group of people! this is an awesome party game!!! you'll have the entire room shouting out prices just like in the show. If you like the show, I highly recommend this game! And don't forget to have you pet spayed or neutered! ;-)"
2513,4,all of the metal gear games are fun to play with being able to use the differnt gagets and you get to kill people. what more can you ask for in a video game. I haven't finished it yet but so far it's as good aas the rest of the metal gear games. I look forward to finishing this one and playing the next one in line.
2514,4,Fine for a cheap gaming keyboard.
2515,4,"I'm a HUGE star wars fan.  I was really excited about this game.  The graphics are among the best of any game I've ever played.  However, be aware, there is no campaign.  If you are looking for a game with a campaign, this game is not for you.  It was really designed for on-line play.  You can play offline, but its NOT a campaign."
2516,4,"DRM or copy protection was made by Sony who was already sued over secret software being installed with a product. This DRM installs above your own administrators rights at what they call RING 0. Normal software installs at RING 3. What can this do? Well its not what it can do, its really what potentially it will do. A copy, foreign or domestic has full control over your PC should you be connected to the  internet since its software installs above your administrators rights. They can deactivate your CD or DVD burner should they be malicious enough to do so. Recently an Electronic Arts moderator threatened to turn off his game on his OWN pc because he did not agree with his forum post asking about this security measure.

This goes way beyond trying to protect your product. With this software they have too much control over your own possession, and they open a backdoor into your PC causing a security risk. They say its not harmful, they say they won't abuse this software. Big corporations are not the most ethical people in the world. EA especially, how many times have they been sued over overtime for their employees? They run a sweatshop for working software programmers. If they will cheat their own employees, do you really want them to have this kind of control over you PC?

I screwed up on my review, I give it 4 stars for FUN, but 1 star for overall. This is just wrong, and since Electronic Arts now has a class action suit against it due to this protection scheme, a lot of other people feel its wrong to, and so will the courts."
2517,4,"The Good: A lot of content, solid fight system, pretty good graphics, new Survival mode is fun

The Bad: Fight system is lacking weapon stances, muddy textures, Konquest mode is missing, only one Fatality per character

I know what you're probably thinking. Deadly Alliance on the GBA? Puh-lease. Don't criticize the game just yet. Deadly Alliance for GBA is a solid fighter with a trick 3D fighting system that is simplified from the console versions. The game features a full Krypt, mini-games, and a new Survival mode. The graphics are surprisingly good and the sound quality is excellent.

Unlike past Mortal Kombat handheld ports this game is actually good. The fight system is a mix of 2D and 3D with each character's 2 main martial arts stances (the weapon stance was taken out). The fight system may seem dumbed down or too simple because the GBA only has two face buttons. Using a combo of the D-pad and face buttons you can pull off some great combos with ease. The whole transition feels natural and hand tailored to the console. My main disappointment is the lack of characters. Only about 10 made it into the GBA version, but a new character, Sareena, made it into the game from Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero. I am also disappointed that each character only has one Fatalitiy (like in the console version), but they are different and quite detailed for a GBA game.

The sound quality is excellent with the announcer's voice intact. The graphics are pretty decent with full 3D backgrounds, but they are very muddy and lack any detail. The graphics are a love/hate type of thing. The Test-You-Might and Sight are fully intact here which is nice, but the Konquest mode is obviously missing, but instead there is a Survival mode that was stuck in here. There is a full Krypt with alternative costumes and other things. So this is a huge MK experience on the GBA and probably the best one.

If you loved Deadly Alliance or just want a solid fighter on your GBA then pick this up. There is a lot of content in here and the fight system is solid and fluid. The graphics look pretty and sound quality is excellent so you have no reason not to play this!"
2518,4,"Does exactly what the product description says, my only complaints are that I do not believe it fully charges the battery (a problem I had with the older brother of this product, the play and charge kit for the Xbox 360), and the overall short length of the cable. If you are like me and have to sit more than five feet from your television, you'll be better served by going for a recharge base."
2519,4,ok
2520,4,"If you like the anime its a good game, just horrible acting and cheesey movie clips. But the game play is fun."
2521,4,"First of all this game didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Graphics at times could've been better and there are a few glitches here and there. I thought it was ok, fairly decent story line. I'm glad that I picked it up for $7.99 at EB games than spending $49.99 when it came out. The strategy guide for this is useless so save your $15. This is not a hard game, you really don't need gameshark codes either. If you find this cheap like I did it's worth it."
2522,4,"After years of waiting, Killzone 2 is finally here. Rarely has a game achieved so much hype, and as of late, any game that HAS been this hyped has been met with mixed reviews, or initial enthusiasm followed by general revile (cases in point: Assassin's Creed and GTA IV)so Killzone 2 has a whole lot to lose.

Does Killzone 2 live up to the hype? In my opinion,it does. BUT: I firmly believe that all the hype all these months...all the expectations really did was detract from this game really shining out. The fact that this game has been in the public's eye for so long sort of puts a damper on its release, I think. But considering the game, whether or not the release is as successful as warranted by so much hype is really immaterial.

-Graphics- this game looks awesome. Does it awe as much as it did a few years ago? Not really. Since then MGS4 came out, Gears 2 came out, Uncharted came out.... this game ranks up there with the best looking games, but it's not THE best looking game... that's really subjective, I think.... how good a game looks.
-Sound- The music swells and epic tracks really surprised me on this one. It really got the job done to set the mood, but the voice acting was really, really bad on most parts. Some parts, like Scolar Visari and Radec were really well acted, but for the most part, awful; good thing the acting doesn't really detract from this game. The background noises I think are top notch, and I think they set a bar for other games with a lot of fighting and shooting going on in the background from now on.
-Gameplay- The game feels tight; I still don't know what people are complaining about the controls feeling weird or floaty....then again, I'm already used to the Sony controller, so that might have something to do with it.... I do have my issues with the campaign gameplay: the game...freezes while saving/loading??? What? I know the game started being produced a while ago, but come on! Freezing? Then why not a 'Loading' screen? Because it's last gen, that's why. Freezing isn't that much better. The other thing would be the incredibly retarded AI. Allow me to specify: the ALLIED AI. The enemy AI is incredibly shrewd, and they cheat, hehehe. You'll be hard pressed to think before you rush any hallway. But your squad mates...boy....they sure die a lot. And then you have to revive them etc.... it gets annoying.  The campaign is pretty good, very fun, and so far, as far as length goes, it's longer than CoD4, so...it might be short (haven't finished it yet) but don't knock it because it's not RPG length. Either way, the MP will have you hooked. A lot of people have looked for a game to replace CoD4 as the mp fps par excellence.... and have been let down repeatedly. I think this game might be it. Although, truth be told, they are just two very different MP experiences....if I had to compare what it feels like to play KZ2 online, I would compare it to Warhawk before I compared it to CoD4. Plus, the classes  give KZ2  a depth the perks don't really achieve: with a perk, and unlocking guns, you can turn yourself into a tank, or be almost invisible, or be a demo expert etc....and you might run around with the P90 while some poor sap has the Mp5 because he's just starting out (the MP5 is a very good weapon, not knocking it  =P  ), but being a different class sort of puts everyone on the level. Since it's clan based, there's also a push for team work in every match you play...something that simply didn't ever happen for me in CoD4.

- Storyline- Umm...what storyline?? Honestly, this game has all the storyline in the opening credits and towards the end. About 5-6 missions in the middle make you  go through the motions of killing stuff without any real plot point to justify it. It's really sad because the game DOES have a storyline...it's not the GREATEST storyline ever, but it's a fun one, kind of exciting....but it was paced horribly. Then again....if I had to compare this game to a movie...I'd compare it to either Rambo II or I dunno.. Starship Troopers. Both simply awful movies if you take into context cinema as an art form....but if you see them as what they are (namely, action flicks) then... what's there to complain?! Heck, all this game lacked was some sex and cigar smoking!

Overall, this game will have me quite occupied in the coming months. It's funny too.... I hadn't bought into the hype until about 6 weeks before the game came out...I hadn't even thought much of the game.. ""just another FPS"". I'm glad I impulse 'pre-ordered' this little gem."
2523,4,My son doesn't play it but there was nothing wrong with the game
2524,4,"My husband and 10 yr old daughter played this game every day until they completed the game, then they went back and tried to get the gold medal on each level.  They loved it.  I found it a little hard and headache inducing.  If you don't hold the gun perfectly level at all times the screen spins around and around until you level it out again which makes me dizzy.  My husband got the hang of it pretty quickly, and my daughter too.  There are two ways to play, either a career type thing where you go along on a long string of hunts looking for specific animals and trying to find the trophy animal of the herd/group/gaggle.  Or you can play like the old nintendo way that Duck Hunt was, the animals or birds come out onto the screen and you try to shoot as many as you can in the time allotted.  This game was a big hit in my house and was worth purchasing."
2525,4,like it
2526,4,"I own a couple pairs of Turtle Beach headphones and I like to have a set for at the office and at home. This pair is not just for gaming, but nice for movies as well if you don't want to disturb others nearby with the noise.

Things I like:
- Pads are comfortable.
- Bass is excellent. ""Powerful"" indeed, as described in the product listing.
- The aesthetics and material quality are nice. I feel like it will be durable in the long run, but I'm always gentle with my equipment anyhow.
- Turtle Beach - cool brand, cool product. I prefer to own something that is appealing.

Things that could be better:
- Price. I feel there are comparable headsets at better prices out there.
- Sizing. It's a bit tight on my big head."
2527,4,good
2528,4,the first one was a little better
2529,4,Product performs as advertised. I recommend this business's products . Look forward to doing business with them in the future.
2530,4,Gave this a 4 star rating.  You get to do all kinds of things in this game.  It is pretty cool.
2531,4,"The Wii is a pretty fun as a casual game experience.  Only on the Wii I can play many games with my wife.  She uses it a lot more than I do.  We primarily use the Wii to play casual games together.  The graphics don't measure up at all to XBox 360 or Playstation 3, but can still be plenty of fun for games where graphics are not important.

I use the Wii for Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Boom Blox, Mario Party, etc.  I find myself using the Wii less and less and my XBox 360 much more now since I more often want to play some deeper, more graphically intensive games.  There far fewer Wii games I am interested than those for other consoles, but the other consoles do not yet have the unique casual game experience that my wife and friends are excited to play.

I still recommend and like the Wii, but it isn't trying to compete with Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 which are entirely different kinds of gaming experiences.  You either want to play some of the casual games with motion controls or you don't.  If you aren't a big fan of Wii Sports, then there is probably little reason to buy a Wii.

Adult friends and family have bought the Wii that would have never bought or played games anymore.  So it definitely has opened games up to them again.  However most of them have significantly decreased their usage of the Wii after the first few months or year, haven't bought new games, or have stopped playing all-together.  So if you don't play and are wondering how long lasting it will be, you probably will not play forever.  But if you want something fun that you can do in a group setting, it is a nice option.

I consider a Wii a replacement for board games.  It is fresher and more exiciting ina group setting than board games for many and can be used once in a while when you want a casual game like that."
2532,4,"This mouse is great for gaming, as the DPI can be adjusted with a centrally located button. Weights in the bottom allow you to further customize the mouse to fit your preference. I have only two issues with this mouse. The first is that it would disconnect from my laptop every time the laptop went into sleep mode. This issue does not occur with my desktop. The second issue is that the mouse would sometimes turn on during the night if a background process started up on my computer, which required me to get out of bed to either unplug the mouse or turn off the computer, though this only happened a few times. Overall, I do like this mouse and the blue lights are much less annoying than the red ones that are equally common in today's gaming mouse market."
2533,4,"Works really well, and the adjustable DPI is nice.
I really wish I could (or new how to?) turn off the LED's though.  I'd rather not have to unplug it or put a hat over it at night."
2534,4,"I've started my third year playing this game after a six month break and am now enjoying it more than ever. This is a game that requires a lot of time for everything. Time to go from place to place, time to level up your jobs (I don't say character because you play any job you want to and switch from job to job without making a new character). It also takes a lot of time to make money and there are many ways to make money in the game it just requires ALOT of patience.

Getting started in this game can be very difficult and frustrating at times but if you talk to people most of them will help you out and guide you to where you need to get to. The game starts you out with you choosing the race you want to play as throught the game. The races you get to choose from are Hume's (male or female), Elvaan's (male or female), Mithra's (female only), Galka's (male only) and the Tarutaru's (male and female). Although there aren't a lot of different races there are many different combinations you can make for each character so running into a similiar character isn't so frequent. This is also where you will pick your main job and there are six jobs to choose from when you first start. After that you choose which country your character lives/comes from and there are three to choose from. The three countries are Bastok, Windurst and Sandoria. Bastok is made up of the Hume's and Galka's, Windy has the Mithra's and Tarutaru's and Sandy is home of the elvaans but you can choose whichever one you want.

Races: Depending on what job you want to do might help you choose the race you want to play as each race is proficient in certain jobs. The Galka's are made for jobs such as Paladin and Warrior classes (tanks jobs in pt's), Elvaan's are geared towards Monk and Dark Knight (Damage Dealer's in pts or DD's if you will), Mithra's are for the Thief and Ranger jobs (support or pullers for ur party), Hume's are the basic all around character and are proficient in any job but don't specialize in a paraticular one and Tarutaru's are the magic wielding jobs such as the White Mage and Black Mage jobs (healer's and debuffs in the party). However, you can pick whatever race you want and whatever job you want just remember that Galka's are not gonna be as good as Tarutaru's in magic and Tarutaru's aren't gonna be as good as Galka's for tanking.

Jobs: The player is given six jobs to choose from called your basic jobs. They are warrior, thief, monk, white mage, black mage and red mage. I'm not gonna go into details because that could take to long. There are 14 other jobs available once the player reaches 30. The player has to do quests to unlock the other jobs and can find out how to by asking someone or just looking it up online. The other jobs are ranger, dark knight, paladin, blue mage, samurai, ninja, corsair, bard, beastmaster, puppetmaster, summoner, scholar, dancer and dragoon. Also for jobs you get to have a subjob which means you have a main job and a job to support it. For instance, say the player is a paladin, the player then gets to choose a job to support that. The player will want to choose a subjob that will support the main job, so that player will most likely choose warrior for the defense bonuses and job abilities that warrior has. Also the subjob is half the level of the main job so if the paladin is lvl 30 the warrior will be lvl 15 with all the abilites the warrior gets at 15. Also by adding warrior as a subjob extra hit points are added onto you're character because of the job warrior. Each subjob presents its own pros and cons, so the player needs to know what subjob best supports the main job.

The storyline progresses at the players leisure and since there are tons of quests and missions that the player will be doing its easy to forget what you've done unless you're progressing really fast which is highly unlikely. Doing missions earns your rank in your home country and quests earn you fame in different countries which definately benefit the player. One example is the ""Lure of the Wildcat"" quest in each town (Sandy, Basty, Windy and Jeuno) when completed gives the player to get teleported to Aht Urghan Whitegate from whatever town they teleported from which will save a lot of time and only costs 300 gil per teleport.

The game is definitely geared for the hardcore people who can spend a lot of time in the game. This is definitely a game where you reap what you sew. If the player just wants to casually play the game and just party and level and talk to friends they can. The thing is that by playing casually the player will most likely not get the really best gear in the game and around level 50 will either start another job or just slowly stop playing the game. The game requires a lot of time, gil and patience for the good armor and weapons in the game if the player is willing to sacrifice it.

This particular edition of final fantasy xi combines the original release plus all the expansions up to the latest wings of the goddess. Each expansion has added new jobs, areas to explore and more missions and quests. I'm not sure what all was added with the first three expansions to the game (rise of zilart, chains of promethia, treasures of aht urghan) as I did not start playing this game till well after the release of TOAU. I do know, however, the Wings of the Goddess expansion released two new jobs: Dancer and Scholar. It also let the player travel to the past (20 years to be exact) through things called Cavernous Maws. WOTG expansion is aimed at the higher level players and I suggest not traveling to the past unless you are 60+ or have someone that can guide you.

I found this final fantasy XI a really good buy when it first came out and now that its twenty dollars its well worth the buy. I've heard people complain about the monthly charge of the game on top of the xbl charge. *For your information:you can play this game on the xbl silver account.* Thing is that most people don't just play this game, they play others as well on xbl and the monthly fee is from the maker's of the game. Alot of mmorpg's have a monthly charge and this one is no different. The updates and installing can take a really long time, maybe to long but you really shouldn't let that deter you from at least trying this game out.

There is so much more to this game and is hard to put in a review, I really don't think its possible to review even half of what this game has to offer someone who really is interested in playing. The only areas that I can think of where this game suffers is the exceptionally hard to make money or gil for weapons and gear and the long installing process and the sometimes very long updates.

All I can really tell you is try the game out and decide for yourself whether or not its a game you want to put a lot of time into. Just remember if you get stuck there are people you can ask to help you out and most of them will be more than happy to. Don't be quick to judge the game from just the beginning, it takes awhile to really get into the heart of the game itself so get out there try it and keep at it."
2535,4,"Bought both this along with the G600 to compare with, and keep which one I liked best. Compared to the G600, the UtechSmart's side buttons are a little harder to press than the G600's. Might cause some cramping in weaker thumb muscles. Also, the G600's buttons are a little easier to distinguish between each other by touch than the UtechSmart's. The UtechSmart's buttons do have a nice clicky feel to them. The thumb rest on the UtechSmart also makes the bottom row of buttons slightly less accessible than the G600 where no thumb rest exists.

Another slight ""con"" I have is that the lights are just a bit too bright on the UtechSmart, even on the lowest setting. Which could be a problem for some in darker conditions.

If you want the best of the two and can afford the few extra dollars, the G600 is the clear winner. But, if you're on a budget, the UtechSmart is the best runner-up behind the G600."
2536,4,"Feels just a tiny bit on the cheap side, and I think I recall the official Classic Controller Pro feeling a bit sturdier in the analog stick. However, this controller works perfectly in conjunction with a Wii Remote for Wii games that support Classic Controller options, as well as for Wii U games such as Super Smash Bros. for Wii U that also share the option. I've put many hours into Xenoblade Chronicles using this controller and plan to put many more into The Last Story once the mood to play that game strikes me. I'd say this is a good buy unless you have a lot of money to burn and are willing to shell out a much higher price for an unused official controller."
2537,4,"Pretty good Twisted Metal clone. Like a lot of PS1 games, you can put it in a CD player and listen to the soundtrack, which in this case is odd remixes of music from the films."
2538,4,This game I got for my kids and they love playing it but it can be hard at times to manuvear the cars around corners but maybe its just me.
2539,4,"Well, this Dead Space is loads of fun. I love playing it, I love how hard it gets, but the only thing I don't like is some of the weapons. Sure, the weapons are awesome, but can't I have a shotgun that can shoot really fast? I don't want to wait for 10secs for the shotgun to be able to shoot again. Just my thought

I just loved all the Dead Spaces. This by far is one of the best.
One of the best games I have out of 6."
2540,4,I should have gone with my gut and bought used one. new one is nice and fresh but so stiff so for shooting games it takes awhile to wear it in.
2541,4,"Front Mission 4 continues its series tradition of turn based strategy, global political struggles, and mech fetishism with gusto.  Compared to its predecessors FM4 is more complex and challenging with better writing overall. If you're just looking to tweak giant robots to perfection while strategizing against ever increasing odds, you'll find bliss here.  Unfortunately FM4 is not graphically advanced for its platform, and the OST merely gets the job done with little invigoration.  The muted graphics and lackluster OST suck some of the fun out, but for hardcore strategists who love mechs, FM4 will certainly keep you busy a long while."
2542,4,Great graphics but very repetitive gameplay.
2543,4,My son loves this game and has been playing it quite a bit since he got it....nice graphics and control! Recommended!
2544,4,"First off, Uncharted 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games of all time.  It mixed all the elements of a good action/adventure and platforming title into one amazing ride.  Drake's Fortune, the game that started it all, has some fun moments, but expect to be frustrated much of the time as well.

Graphically, the game probably had some of the best when it was released.  It's unfair to compare it to its successor (Uncharted 2) because, of course, the graphics in the latter are superior.  The consensus: Good for its time.  So let's move on, shall we?

The voice acting is exactly what you can expect from any in the Uncharted series: It's amazing.  Drake is his sarcastic, clownish self and Nolan North does a perfect job portraying him.  Everyone is believable and that's what you should expect from a video game (Kratos, I love ya, but the shouting hurts ears after awhile-and I'd imagine your throat too).

Gameplay: Aw, yes...  This is where I found it to be the most frustrating.  While elements are similar to Uncharted 2, they are far inferior when presented in Drake's Fortune.  First off, a big gripe I have is aiming.  If aiming a gun only puts it in the general vicinity where the person/mutant creature I'm trying to kill is located at, and not the actual creature (fortunately, in Uncharted 2, this was fixed...good job, developers!), how is that really called aiming?  I can't tell you how many times I (Drake) died because of the inability to successfully aim at someone/something to take it out.  Also, as many reviews have pointed out, the wave after wave of kill types (meaning you take out a group of guys, platform a bit, then repeat...and this happens throughout 3/4s of the game, people) is not only repetitive, but frustrating - I'd much rather have more platforming than killing enemy over and over in the same manner over and over (again, Uncharted 2 improved on this, rightfully so).  I also found the controls themselves to be wonky, at times even horrible, largely when I was told on a small indicator on the lower left of the screen to ""shake"" my control to get rid of a mutant enemy trying to bite into me.  Had I known this was what it meant before I died over and over, that would have been greatly appreciated.  Also, sorry for the spoilers, but you don't just fight evil men-you fight mutants.  Seriously.  And you don't know you have to until the first few times you get killed by them because, a, you have too little time to realize that these aren't people, they're mutant creatures that bite into you and, b, your aim controls don't really aim.  I digress, but can you tell how frustrated I am at this part?!  Why?  Because what would be an overall great title was ruined by some really bad, clunky controls.  As such, Uncharted 2 fixed them all, but that's why I recommend playing through this one first if you are new to the Uncharted series.  Overall, gameplay is decent, but lacking in many surprising ways that could've been fixed oh so easily.

In the end, Uncharted-Drake's Fortune is an amazing action/action game with many pros, but it is the significance of what it lacks that drag it down so much because, after you play it, you'll soon realize how frustrating the detracting aspects of this title can be (I, for one, can say I was actually disturbed in Chapter 19 (the devil chapter)...for those of you who have played, you know what I mean).  It's a wildly fun, sometimes significant frustrating game that, despite its cons, is still one you ought to play.  Just be sure to buy another controller to replace the one you'll surely throw at the wall from time to time!"
2545,4,"Designed to hold  a Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DS Lite system, this puch features the cast of the Mario Bros games in a cool looking-officially licensed product at an affordable price.

Exterior is made of hard material to protect the contents, however, the one star I am taking out is because, being a compact case, there is little room for storage for items other than the Dsi (like the
power cable for example)

 As many other reviewers have stated,  only three games fit into this case (maybe more if you don't mind to potentially damage the case as the space is not meant for more)  There is some additional storage space included but not enough if you carry too much stuff like accessories and the like. If you are looking for a compact case to carry only the necessary things to play, this may be what you need, if you would like to carry all your accessories and more than three-four games, you may want to look for another option.

As a Mario Bros fan, I loved the design and it simply looks very well made and sturdy; again, this is a great option to have your Dsi on the go without having to carry too many things with it."
2546,4,"This is a very fun game to play, it is also aggravating, complex and hard as heck in a couple of places if you don't cheat (Glares at cheaters) but it is a blast to play and really fun of course if the rogues let a troll kill off my tax collector one more time because i haven't placed a bounty on it yet i will level their guildhall..."
2547,4,"Was a good game to play, enjoyed how long it lasted and the difficulty. I used to have this game as a kid and decided to pick it up again after a few years and wasn't disappointed. Only thing I have a issue was the acting, not the best but then again most kids won't notice."
2548,4,Great display unit for any gaming setup and with the small compartment on the bottom you can put some earbuds or a mic for your PS4 over all a great product
2549,4,Good
2550,4,"Half-Life: Opposing Force is the expansion pack for Half Life, But not by the creators of the orginal game Valve but by another company called Gearbox. To install this game you must have the orginal game half life installed on your system. You don't play Gorden Freeman here, You play Adrian Shephard a 22 year old marine sent to the black mesa to deal with the aliens and Gordon Freeman, He and his men crash into the black mesa and they are rescued by the scientists, Now he must fight his way out of the black mesa with the help of other marines, But unfortunatly the aliens are not the only ones he needs to deal with, The goverment has sent black dressed assasins to kill all the marine's, He needs to deal with them too, You could see gorden freeman too. The Level design is good but nothing compared to the superlative half-life level design which has an infinte replay value. While half-life started and ended on a tram, Opposing Force starts and ends on a helicopter with the same ending.
Opposing Force is built on the same quake2 half-life engine, Almost everything from the main menu is the same as half life, There are many new weapons but not any cool weapon like the crossbow, Even the crowbar is not here. The Grenade is looks much smaller here, Maybe Gorden freeman has small hands or maybe Adrian has large hands. Many new monstors but none like Gronarch. Many new charecters but i did not like the new security gaurd, The one who opens the door to let Shephard out in the first level. Compared to HL the game is quite short and linear, The load times are quite longer and the story is quite unbelivable and some sences are very silly. The puzzles are good but most of them are inspired from the orginal game, In one level you need to kill a monstor the same way you kill the tentecles In the HL level ""Blast Pit"". I did not like all the silly jokes too (No aliens were harmed during the creation of this game), Gearbox this is supposed to be an expansion pack for half life not Quake. Just like thief you need to climb ropes too, But climbing and swinging ropes is quite badly done and not as easy as thief. Opposing Force is not an awful game, It is a very good game and a must for half life fans, But it lacks the great story, superb gameplay, great puzzles, level design, superb action and orginality that made half life so great. It does not live up to the expectations it created as the half life expansion pack."
2551,4,This game reminded me of Half-life Opposing force without the aliens. I can't really say it's very scary but there are few parts that surprised me.
2552,4,"These days, everyone has a video game system that has a internet connection. Although it seems to be a must right now, it is very difficult match for those who don't have the wireless connection to the high-speed internet highway, Nintendo has now made it more exciting for gamers who just thought it would be all about the Nintendo DS. The Wi-Fi USB Connector from Nintendo, which worked with the Nintendo DS, now works as a accessory for the Nintendo Wii. You can use this for the DS to play against players from the internet on handheld DS games like Mario Kart DS, Tetris DS, and many other great games. Also, it is now a great tool for Wii owners as well. You can simply use this to download great games for the Wii's virtual console like Super Mario 64, and Bonk's Revenge from the Turbographx 16 classic system. I definitely think this is a great buy more than ever for anyone who owns a Wii and for DS owners too.

Price: B+

Convience: B

Overall: B 1/2+"
2553,4,"Winning Eleven has the market on realism cornered.  While FIFA has more players, leagues, and teams, WE has the more realistic gameplay.  I am new to the franchise because I prefered FIFA's bevy of teams and leagues, but WE is a great game in its own right.  The gameplay is very realistic and the game just seems to flow better than on other soccer games.  That being said, there are some negatives.  The background music is annoying so I'd shut it off.  I'm not a big fan of the Master League mode.  As a newbie to the game, I think the controls are somewhat tough to master as well.  Beyond that, though, the game is very fun and very realistic.  This game delivers excellent gameplay, solid graphics, and the most realism of any soccer game."
2554,4,"I bought this for my kids in December of 2013, and it's still working fine. There's a newer model now, I see, but I'd hope it's as durable.

There have been zero issues with using or charging this. I'm only docking a star because Nintendo opted to only have one of the ""real"" controllers - the one with the screen - forcing others to use these. If you have kids, you know there will be a fight if the controllers aren't equal. So, it isn't this controller's fault. It's a fine little controller. But... no screen = possible fighting. Beware."
2555,4,"Great battle system,,, bosses ,,,, open ,,, freedom but side misions sometimes tedious"
2556,4,its  useful
2557,4,"This is my first Assassins Creed game , I know I just haven't gotten into the series and never bother to pick one up , with hat said I love this one so far I played about and hour of this and couldn't put it down , I loved running around jumping on buildings its so much fun , Graphics are ok when in game play there amazing but cut scenes look a bit rough . But all in all its fun and addicting , for my first Assassins Creed game its awesome plus shes an amazing character ."
2558,4,"This is the first Game Boy Advance game for the Teen Titans series.  In fact it's the first Teen Titans video game for any platform !  And I have to admit, this is very amazing.

It has such impressive gameplay and graphics.  Not to mention some awesome unlockables via collecting hidden cards in the game.  Like in ""Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-ED-ventures"", you get to switch out the Titans each with his or her own special powers.

Basically, the concept of this game involves the HIVE stealing all of the Titans moves and making horrific Titan clones.  It's up to the real Teen Titans to end this once and for all.

So in hindsight, it's a good game.  But brace up, the multiplatform game for PS2, XBOX, and Game Cube are on the way !"
2559,4,"Fun game. Can be played Co op locally. Not a lot of replay ability, but a good game the first time through."
2560,4,"Just got this game a few days ago and having a great time with it.  This is a great game if you are looking for mindless fun.  It's not hard at all, anyone will be able to pick up a controller and join the destruction.  The only issue is the game is really short, soon after you start playing you will have unlocked everything.  The only thing that takes a whole lot of time is the upgrades to the cars, which are won by repeating the Championship mode over and over.  I have not tried the on-line modes yet but from what I have read it's the best part of the game.  I can't wait to try it out.  This game is well worth the money."
2561,4,"Fun game but just another call of duty,

I was expecting the graphics to be amazing throughout the game. But in the campaign it's just some scenes look really good and others just look good.

Online graphics are good but still similar to other call of duty games.

 the game is the same as all the other call of duty games but the difference is graphics, guns, maps, campaign story and the exo suit"
2562,4,"The game is a must play for any one ( i did a review of the game on the regular version seccion) this is a review of the limited edition.

nice, but could be better. The eurpoean limited edition of this game is what this one should be. It has a real iron mask and must of the things this one had, even a better presentation.

gete the regular."
2563,4,"Graphics of the ""Need for Speed"" games is very well done and the game keeps you coming back for more!"
2564,4,"Maybe it's just not my bag of chips. I just belive there are more to video games nowadays than just shooting foward. Yes I did own this game...until I traded it in. I just couldn't get into it. I oh so wanted to, but I just couldn't. SO don't hate me for giving it a bad review...I'm already doing that myself."

2566,4,"Set between ""Saw"" and ""Saw 2""  before part 3, Detective Tapp has been kidnapped by the one and only Jigsaw killer (Voiced by Tobin Bell), killed Detective Sing and thrown Tapp into a large abanoned asylum. The place is booby trapped with various traps, torture devices and even helpless victims you have to save as you are trying to find out the truth behind Jigsaw including trying to escape.

A fun and challenging third-person point of view survival horror thriller game based on the popular horror thriller franchise. Twisted Pictures with Lionsgate interactive and Konami have teamed up to make a game based on their franchise to the small screen in a nice successful way. The graphics here on PS3 are quite nice even during cinematic cut-scenes but i heard the xbox360 has bad graphics compared to this version. You can use any various item as a weapon and use a lighter or flash-light to see in the dark even in the creepiest of places. The only voice actor that was from the movies happens to be Tobin Bell of the Saw film fame, sure the controls aren't too bad but you gotta remember of them.

The Puzzles are a bit challening for some players but this is a game that requires brain power then you will succeed if by following patterns or using your mind. In this game you get to also try to help victims out of Jigsaw's torture traps and even get keys out of syringe ridden toliets to acid barrels, there are even enemies in this game that are out to kill you but you have to be prepared with a weapon of any kind. This game also has concept art galleries, E3 Demo footage and a trailer to Saw 6 which i think was preety neat.

Easily the most enjoyable horror movie based game this side of ""Friday The 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" for NES."
2567,4,"For the most part a fun game.  Over all good, but there are some bad points, this game can be a fun way to waste some time.  One negative I have about it, is there is no difficulty settings, I am not a great game player, usually playing on easy to normal mode, this game can be a bit unforgiving at times, it takes persistence to get though the liberation of military bases and the missions, the towns are not that bad (except disable the monitoring stations)

Overall, while liberating the military bases and the missions can be a bit frustrating (this could be fixed by adding a difficulty settings), the game overall is a fun game.  One of the fun parts is when you go off the story part of the game and just mess around, picking up fast cars and crashing them into gas stations,  Taking a fighter jet, and crashing it into a fuel tank, or any of the other maham you can do in the game.

The one improvement I would like to see in this game (and this would take it to a 5 star for me) is to add a difficulty setting, not every one is good at games, and play for some fun and the story.  But still it is a fun game."
2568,4,"I've read a lot of positive and negative reviews myself, and most are fairly accurate.  There's definitely a niche of gamers that this will really apply to, but should still be a worthwhile purchase (or rental for those who can play for a week straight) for any RPG fan in general.

The story is by far the strongest point.  There will be times that make you cry, times that make you laugh, and times that make you so raging mad that you forget a certain character is fictional - like a good book.  Great cinematics, great voice acting, great plot.

The combat is fairly hit-and-miss (no pun intended).  It took me until my 15th hour of playing to really figure out how to use combos and party orders (focus, combo, free, etc) to my advantage.  Learning how to get some HP and MP back by using ground combos was very important.  However, there is rarely a chance to take advantage of Connect skills, since you can't call for healing while connected, and battles are too fast or too on-the-edge to bother with another character's skills.  Many of the boss fights are great and very challenging - sort of from the Kingdom Hearts genre.

One major disappointment, although I am still a good 5 hours from the finish, is that the game brings strategic situations into play with a flourish, then all but ignore them for the rest of the game.  The first hour of play is heart-pumping escaping and racing the clock, then soon after that is a great siege scenario... then it drops off to the occasional ho-hum ""win before time runs out"" scenario, if at all.  They could definitely have taken advantage of multi-party situations more - so far there has only been one (absolutely fantastic) section where that occurred.

I couldn't be happier with my purchase, though, and the only reason I probably won't play through it again is that so many good RPGs have come out or are coming out for the 360 - Vesperia, Last Remnant, Fable II, etc...  hard to keep up with!"
2569,4,"Fits a little small, but sounds incredible."
2570,4,"I will say at the outset that I am not a gamer.  What sold me on this particular board is the soft white backlighting of the keys.  When I am working in the dark, that is very helpful, especially since I do most of my freelance work for film editing, etc at night and prefer a low-lit atmosphere.

This keyboard functions much like the keyboard on my laptop, which makes it what I would call a 'fast' keyboard. Before this keyboard, I was using a Microsoft Windows Internet Pro that I did not want to part with, but I was easily able to program the keys and am now using this one on a Dell desktop, Windows 7, 64 bit OS. I set much of the functionality up around my non-linear editing program (Adobe CS 5, Premiere Pro. Having those shortcuts available make it very easy and fast to work on projects. A decent deal for the money."

2572,4,"My Little son enjoys playing this game. He ended up getting hooked on the new Super Mariio Bros, but if he is not playing Mario, He will be playing this game and his 3rd choice is Spongebob Atlantis, or Tenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He has a total of 8 games and at first this was his favorite game."
2573,4,"I bought Pro version 360,w/175W chipset. It runs a bit quieter,not as hot. Oh yeah,I still have my other 360,203W chipset,as backup. I like the 360,no fanboy here,because I will get a PS3 down the road. All I can say is it hasn't broken down yet,and I hope I do not have to deal w/MS customer service again(RROD).  P.S. Cannot connect my Intercooler EX,while the connector plug going to the back of the 360(175W) is different for the old(203W)version. There is the plastic piece is middle of EX F connector."
2574,4,"First of all, download and install free of issues, as well as updating. Game is good, lots of action, team-based missions, etc. When you play campaign you surely rate it good, sometimes very good. But things got weird when you switch to MP. The thing is online and SP engines are different, I mean, you actually have 2 games in a pack, and MP is waaaayyyy better. Go online and you have plenty of settings to adjust, the sound is superb, graphics are top notch, playability is incredible... much better than SP. Then, when you go back to campaign, you can't rate it as very good anymore. Comparision is inevitable. Although you have to learn how to play online, because in the beggining you die all the time, it's worth a try. Incredibly real, you can't put it down no matter how you suck on it. For Win 7 users who are having mouse issues when navigating through MP interface (can't click on anything), solution is: right click on desktop and select ""personalize"", then select ""basic"" and click ""ok"". Your wallpaper will change to Win 7 basic, but you'll be able to click on anything when playing MP."

2576,4,"This is a great game. Yes you need a monster of a PC to run it well; but if you do, the game is amazing. 1920x1080 runs smooth with maxed settings on a 8800 GTX SLI on a QX6700@2.92Ghz - on a 46"" HDTV.

But keep in mind that the game has starforce v4.7. This isn't as bad as the dreaded v3.0. But it's still starforce. You've been warned."
2577,4,"Pros:

* Protects your 3ds very well
* Adds a very good grip to the whole system
* Can be put and removed quickly

Cons:

* Does NOT have an open for cartridge change, so either you open one yourself or remove the bottom part to change it. (Not a huge problem but it is a detail that had to be considered)
* R / L buttons are harder to press, It is much softer to press those buttons without this item, It is not difficult though but you can feel the difference at the beginning."

2580,4,"The first 10-15 mins. of the game bored me but the rest is godly. The cartoon animations don't make this game bad at all. i like the way you can string together combos to beat your opponents and variety of items is good. the story is very good and keeps the player hypnotized; I played 5 hours until my mom told me to quit. I still wanted to play. The only reason I didn't give the game 5 stars was because sometimes I had to look at the walkthrough because i was stuck. for example, in the dungeon with lava, i woulnd't hae poured a pot of water in lava. In real life the water would have had no chance, but in the game the water makes the lava hard so you can easilly pass through it. Get the game if you can find it at a great price. A must have for all gamecube owners."
2581,4,"Prototype (excuse me, [PROTOTYPE]) is a bit of a mixed bag that, for all its faults and foibles, works far more than it doesn't.  The end result is something that feels a bit unfinished, a bit unpolished, and more of a dry run (in the same way that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-first-Assassin-s-Creed/dp/B000P46NMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the first Assassin's Creed</a>&nbsp;turned out to be); almost as if the developers stopped and said ""That's all well and good, but... let's make sure it works before we spend TOO much time and money on it.""  Which is an approach that's bound to create at least a few flaws: an open city that feels a bit sparse, flat, and untextured, enemies that feel repetitive, lightly varied side quests, unimaginative story and uninspired voice acting... you know, a small grocery list of things that just all feel unfinished or rough around the edges.

Oh, and thank goodness someone finally had the guts to stand up, take a risk, and make a video game protagonist who's a twenty to thirty something thin, handsome, white, American male who's super smart and/or strong!  ...Look, I don't want to dwell on this and I know that's your target audience, but come on, seriously?  Would it have been a worse game about someone who can run up buildings and change their hands into blades if they'd messed with that formula even in the slightest?  Sigh...

Anyway.

It's strange I should be complaining about your main character since he is by far what works best in the game.  Alex Mercer IS the [PROTOTYPE] (a man with super powers from a super virus and super plot-convenient amnesia out for REVENGE... or something!) and his super human running, jumping, gliding, smashing, killing, throwing, and maiming is a blast.  It happens intuitively and with surprising ease.  I was nervous at first when I saw just how many different things Alex could do (mostly violent things) but the wheel that switches between powers, the hot keys, even the (touchy) targeting system were all pretty easy to grasp making for some smooth, effective slaughter. With a little practice you can become an extremely efficient fighter, able to dismantle some soldiers and tanks, cause some mayhem, escape around a few buildings and shapeshift to go back into hiding in a really fluid and enjoyable way.  There's enough variety in fighting styles and enough stealth options to keep things interesting for longer than if this were a simple button masher and the destruction you bring is incredibly satisfying.  There's also a really clever sort of ""bullet-time"" effect that happens when targeting or switching powers or charging attacks that slows things down enough to give you (the player) a few precious seconds to plan your next move.  It's incredibly clever and effective, if you can get the hang of it.

I half-mentioned the under-budgeted feeling; the plus side of it is that the game feels very lean, trimmed of fat, and designed to JUST KEEP MOVING!  The mission objectives are simplistic and straight-forward, the events are chaotic and colorful and the enemies JUST KEEP COMING.  Alex is fluid, he's living mercury, can recover from just about anything and is at his best when on the go.  Hit and run, hit and run, run and run, just RUN!  The game world has been stripped of the unnecessary (it's almost entirely glitch-free) and left room for lots and lots of chaos to ensue.  And that chaos quickly becomes your best friend: pitting the army against the infected while the civilians get mashed in the middle gives you time to complete your objectives and then run and hide before getting overrun by your surprisingly determined and effective enemies.

Oh, and about those civilians...

I've gone on at length already, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the poor humans trapped in the middle.  The prototype world is an incredibly amoral world and your hero, Alex Mercer, is not a hero at all.  He's not even an anti-hero.  He's... just sort of a jerk.  And it's not just him: every character we meet is at least a little tainted and out for their own ends.  There are no 'morality' choices involved and no punishment at all for picking up a hapless civilian just walking down the street and ripping them to pieces.  Even Grand Theft Auto has police and the army to come around and make a token effort of trying to stop you.  Most games at least acknowledge that you're being bad when you're being bad.  Not so in Prototype - it's never even menteioned.  The city is little more than Alex's playground and the people in it are his toys.  And you WILL slaughter them, you can't avoid it; believe me, I tried.  You'll need to absorb them for energy, you can't always pick them out from the infected they're being attacked by, and they have a strange habit of running right in front of your tank while you're racing the clock.  The game makes it very clear that 'normal' people are of no concern to you, not even in the slightest. It's a really... interesting feeling and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying it.  Like, a lot.  But it's something to be mentioned.

Like lambs to the slaughter, as they say..."
2582,4,"I've been a huge fan of Syphon Filter ever since Syphon FIlter came out for PS1.  1 was a classic, 2 a bit lacking in the graphics but great storyline, and 3 man, what a game!
Omega Strain I didn't like too much. BUT, Dark Mirror is the absolute BEST to date. Amazing storyline, the graphics are unbelievable for a hand held game! While the controls took a bit of gettng used to, the training levels take care of that in no time. This is a MUST HAVE PSP game. If you don't believe me, try for yourself you won't regret it."
2583,4,"First and foremost, a keyboard needs to serve its most basic function: that of translating keystrokes into data. Macros, back-lighting, aesthetics, and other features are great. However, they all come second to how it functions as a keyboard. I write a lot of words each day. In the range of 4-5 thousand. Sometimes more than that. I need a keyboard that makes typing feel effortless and that provides just the right amount of feedback. The Raptor K30 offers excellent feel--among the very best I've ever used, and I've owned A LOT of keyboards, including the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CM-Storm-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0068INSUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CM Storm Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyborg-V-7-Keyboard/dp/B007W81IC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyborg V.7 Keyboard</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G710-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B009C98NPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G710+ Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a>&nbsp;and a few others. Of all of them, I'd rate the Raptor K30 the second best in terms of tactile feel and key response. That's pretty fantastic considering I'm comparing it to several mechanical keyboards that cost 2x as much. The only keyboard I've used that I like better is the CM Storm Mechanical Keyboard.

What makes the K30 shine? As many other reviewers have noted, the K30 has individual keys that stand above the keyboard and are not contained by a frame. This gives them a nice, robust feel and makes them very easy to clean. They also have just the right amount of resistance--they give solid feedback but don't require excessive effort to push. Space bar, the most used key of all, is solid and works perfectly regardless of where you hit it with your thumb. You'd be amazed how many keyboards have an uneven or sticky space bar. It's like making a car with oval wheels: I'm looking at you, Saitek Cyborg.

Writing with the the K30 is smooth and effortless. The keys feel precise and have a pleasing tactile quality.

Aesthetically, what some are describing as 'cheap' or 'unpolished' I find simply utilitarian. I don't need 'bling' on a keyboard. I need it to function perfectly 100% of the time. I need to NOT think about my keyboard. The K30 is simple, unassuming, and does its job.

The macros are great, but anyone that uses macros regularly already knows about AutoHotKey and uses that for macros within games or elsewhere. If the K30 is your first foray into macros, check out Autohotkey (freeware). The features of that program make 5 special keys that store a few macros seem silly by comparison. That said, they are very useful for one keystroke sequences for specialty tasks. At first the orientation (left side of keyboard) kept confusing me--I found myself hitting the ""G1"" instead of Escape. After a few days of use my hands adjusted and I stopped making that mistake.

The back lighting works well. I don't have a preference in color; red works as well for me as anything. If you have a strong preference, the K30 might not be for you.

The media keys are nice, but their positioning above the number pad makes them a bit awkward to reach. They're shallow keys and end up partially hidden by the number pad. With all the unused real estate at the top of the keyboard, I wonder why Corsair didn't put them there instead. It would have made them far more accessible.

It would also have been nice to receive black key cap replacements for the WSAD keys (they are silver-grey). I don't mind their coloration, but that would have been a nice touch by Corsair.

Another minor beef is that the led back lighting, when on lower settings, doesn't quite fully illuminate the text on the ""print screen"", ""scroll lock"", ""pause / break"" and other lettered keys. It makes the text on those keys look a little indistinct or blurry. With the brightness turned up to a higher level the issue goes away.

For the price, you'd be hard pressed for find a keyboard with a better overall feel than this one. No, it's not a mechanical keyboard, but it's also priced much cheaper. I have no problems giving this keyboard 4 stars and a solid recommendation."
2584,4,"Based on the input from my nieces 8 & 9, they love playing it. They had blast doing the dance moves."
2585,4,I'm a retired granny and love the casual computer games.  This one is fun and graphics are great; Its just too short.
2586,4,"Ubisoft has finally debuted their new ip, and finally they have something to accompany assassins creed on their yearly schedule. Watch dogs is a third person open world action crime drama that is somewhat reminiscent of grand theft auto. You are aiden Pearce, the vigilante, who roams the streets of a futuristic Chicago fighting crime and unraveling conspiracies. Aiden's niece is killed in a tragic drive by connected to aiden's past and he's on a revenge trip. It's a fairly generic story with some fun twists and a very strong ending. The strong point of the story is the the strong anti social media message that resounds long after the campaign ends. Some characters are very strong such as T-bone or lucky Quinn, and others not so much, like Clara Lille and, to an extent aiden. I can't help thinking that maybe if... It wasn't aiden's niece and sister, and maybe his wife and daughter, it would have a much stronger story. None the less, the story was solid and despite some lousy voice actors, most of the characters were pretty cool. The graphics are awesome, some of the best I've seen on next gen. I experienced no pop in or any other glitches. And though some of the colors are kind of drab, I feel it captures Chicago quite well. The sound is quite great, especially the gun fire. A satisfying pop and a rather gross splat. And, as I stated before, some of the voice acting is pretty spotty, while some is pretty strong t-bone probably being the best. Now on to the mechanics, the on foot mechanics are spectacular, the best I've seen science gta V. While the driving mechanics are pretty crappy, you can't shoot, you can't bank worth a crap, and because of the strict morality system it actually matters if you run down some civilians. You are primarily dependent on hacking various environmental obstacles to escape the police and incapacitate your enemies. There are also many side missions to keep you busy for a few days, but not near as many as games like gta V or assassin's creed. As someone who almost never 100%'s a game I did this one, so I imagine most folks will. Another trait worth noting is the multiplayer, that, although sometimes intrudes on the campaign is pretty fun and a new concept altogether. Basically through a system of matchmaking and connectivity, frequently allows other players to invade your game and you to invade theirs. There is also some nudity and plenty of crass language so this one is defiantly a 16+ game. Watch dogs may not quite live up to the hype, but it's defiantly a solid new series from a great publisher and I would defiantly recommend it to fans of the genre."
2587,4,"These are two of the best video games ever, in one package. Very fun!

Pros:
Two games in one
Price is great, especially for two games
Runs flawlessly
Looks great on the newer hardware

Cons:
These are basically button-mashing games. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you should be aware that it is what it is.
Although they look great upsampled to the hi-def hardware, they still show their age and you can tell that they are older games. No surprise here, and they've done a great job making them look great. But they won't compare to a newer title (if anyone even expects them to)
Options on the older games weren't as plentiful as they are now. As such, these games can be hard in places, without the ability to adjust difficulty.

Overall a great package, with 2 great games, at a great price!"
2588,4,"Story wise it's not the best of the series, but not really the worst either. Graphics are beautiful, game play is fun and the co-op mode is a little addictive. A decent challenge, without the frustration that you typically get from COD or Halo on the hardest settings on your first run through. Even if you've never played a Resident Evil game, it's worth taking a look at."
2589,4,"This game was the main reason I wanted to get an Xbox one in the first place. I have always been into WW1 but never really knew too much about it since they barely teach it in schools. That's why I love the trivia they add in the loading screens (which take TOO long even for team deathmatch). This game looked amazing, and it still does. I love the dynamic weather changes, but it changes too quickly. It will be clear as day one minute and then before you know it you can't see because it's a fog fest. I really wish they made repairing your planes, tanks, etc a bit faster honestly. I was in a fighter plane on Monte Grappa (not that it really matters) and I nearly died trying to repair my plane. This was also a problem in the campaign. I was playing the last mission in ""Through Blood and Mud"" and had trouble getting through the first half of the city without getting light up like the fourth of July. The campaign has too many stealth missions for a World War 1 game. One second I'll be in a massive tank battle and the next I'll be sneaking up on people with a shovel (which I have a lot of fun with). The ""Nothing Is Written"" mission I can totally understand since that's how Lawrence of Arabia carried out his quests. I don't understand why there are so many stealth missions with the Australian against the Ottomans. Let's go back to the cover of the game for a second. Why is this guy on the cover when he had little to do with the actual story? Honestly, I'd love to have the driver from Through Blood and Mud and the guy you play as during the Italian mission on the cover than this stupid guy Now back to the multiplayer for a second. This is just me, but I don't like most of th3 default maps, thus why I got the premium pass. I don't like Monte Grappa, Empire's Edge, Ballroom Blitz, and I have mixed feelings about Fao Fortress. I mainly play Team Deathmatch so make of that what you will. One more thing, why does it take so long to level up both in game and in classes?? I've played more than 14 hours with the medic and support class. I'm level 1 in medic and level 0 in support. That's ridiculous.

Review over. Summary of it all, it's a game that needs some fixing and maybe for once add new campaign missions as DLC, that would be cool!"

2591,4,Good quality product. Game play is awesome
2592,4,"I don't really care at all about ATVs.  I've never ridden one and don't have that much of an interest too.  I also don't enjoy racing games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Need-For-Speed-3-Hot-Pursuit/dp/B000038ABJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Need For Speed 3: Hot Pursuit</a>&nbsp;or Gran Turismo.  That aside, Pure is a pretty fun and entertaining game.  The main premise of the game is to do tricks.  This is another area of games that I really despise, because usually the best tricks involve ridiculously complicated control combinations that my 30-year old hands are not possible of executing.  Pure's trick combinations are very easy to pull off though, and don't require memorizing difficult button combinations.  In the simplest form, it involves pushing a button and a control pad direction.  I was able to pull off some really cool-looking tricks without reading any instructions, and spent a good 4 hours doing so before deciding to learn some more difficult maneuvers.

Some of the main things to do in Pure:

1. World Tour - This is the standard racing tour that all of these games have.  For the most fun, I would suggest newcomers start here and complete it before moving on to the other two events below.  One of the fun parts of this is that you start out with weak ATVs, and get more options and better parts as you progress, allowing you to fully customize your ATV.
2. Racing - This is where I spent most of my time with the game.  Races are a combination of speed and tricks.  You'll need to accomplish a lot of tricks to gain speed, and you need a lot of speed to get access to the best tricks.
3. Sprints - As the name implies, these are short races on a track. These are a little too fast-paced for me and I had difficulty pulling off tricks and still finishing the race in a respectable time.
4. Trial Mode - Even though the tricks can be fun, the landscapes gave me the most enjoyment in the game. I really like exploring in games, and the landscape detail in Pure is gorgeous.  I actually spent most of my time in this game just checking out the detail in my environment rather than focusing on the race.  This is why Trial Mode is so great in the game.  A lot of racing games look like they have enormous backgrounds, they restrict you to a specific track through the use of fences, bales, etc.  or even more annoying, you can only explore the course during a race, which gives you about 2 minutes to look around.  In Trial Mode, you can do whatever you want and spend as much time as you want on a course.  This is a great feature."
2593,4,"The original Your Shape: Fitness Evolved provided an excellent showcase of what the Kinect was capable of in regards to fitness and exercise. Its motion detection was revolutionary in terms of how well it detected how well you were performing exercises, and the mini-games it included were both tons of fun and moderately good exercise.

I'm happy to say that Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012 does push the platform forward, in an evolutionary if not a revolutionary way. Still, it is by far the best ""pure workout"" game that you can get on the Kinect.

When you start out the game,  you see a blue screen which adjusts the sensor and detects who you are. You're then brought to a home screen, where you see a stylized cartoon image of yourself. That's right, there's no need to create an avatar, because you ARE the avatar. This little change was a huge improvement over the first version, where you played as a brightly colored silhouette. It makes a world of difference, because now you can see your limbs and your body position much clearer than before and match them against the on-screen trainer.  More on that below.

The home screen shows a number of different counters: medals won, badges won, and percent of content you've played through. On the right you can see the total number of calories you've burned playing the game. I do like the fact that there are clear milestones and targets to aim for, which will keep you coming back to the game. (One question a lot of people have is--did Ubisoft fix the annoying bug from the first version where it'd lose track of which sessions you've finished in a given routine. The happy answer is yes--now, no matter what order you do the exercises in the system will keep accurate track of which ones you've completed).

At the main menu, you have a variety of choices which are color-coded into categories. The blue icons represent your tools. You can keep track of your overall progress, set objectives and take a fitness quiz so the system can recommend specific workouts for you, or go online to share your progress with the community. I do like that they made the fitness test optional in this version, so those who want to can just jump into the exercises.

There are three remaining categories: Yellow icons represent ""Activities"", which are mini-games. Red icons represent ""Workouts"" which are traditional generic calisthenics and strength building exercises of the kind you might find at a gym. Finally, purple icons represent ""Classes"", which are essentially themed Workouts.

Under the yellow ""Activities"", you have the following mini-games:

1) Wallbreaker: This is essentially the same game as ""Virtual Smash"" in last year's version. In it, you have to punch across your body to hit blue blocks that appear next to your virtual character's body. The more blocks you punch accurately and quickly, the higher your multiplier will go up and the more a grid behind you will fill up--fill it up completely and it'll collapse. As you get to higher levels you'll have to kick blocks as well and avoid red blocks and giant anvils swinging at you. Even though this is basically a rehash of last year's version, it's still immensely fun, and the fact that you're controlling ""you"" and not just a silhouette of you adds a certain dimension to the game. I'd rate this one a 4 of 5 for workout intensity and a 5 of 5 for fun.

2) Stack 'Em Up: This one is essentially the same game as the game from last year's version called...""Stack 'Em Up"". This is the one where you're holding a plank and trying to catch and balance blocks that are falling from the sky. There are some new twists this year--to make your bar longer you have to raise a leg in the air. Also, the blocks come in different sizes, and they can even turn into ice or catch on fire (you need to kick a giant water drop to make it rain). Interestingly, I found the graphics of last year's version much clearer than this year's, especially when it tells you where to drop your blocks. This one gets a 3 of 5 for workout intensity and a 5 of 5 for fun.

3) Run the World: Ah, finally something brand new. This is an activity where you ""run in place"". But there's a twist. You can choose either New York or London and basically ""run through"" the city from landmark to landmark. When I first heard about this one, I was excited--I thought it might be a virtual reality experience where you could literally run through actual streets (if this sounds outlandish, remember that the technology is already there with Google Maps and Bing Maps, not to mention driving games that have mapped out those cities' streets). But in reality, the experience was much less impressive than that. You basically just run in place on a blank white screen following a line of stylized ""yellow dots"" on the road. As you run, you do see buildings to your left and right, but they're just generic grey outlines. As you ""approach"" a famous landmark you'll see that building's distinctive outline, see a tiny photo of the building, and read some trivia about it. Note also that the distances you run are not literal--I'm quite familiar with downtown New York, and there's no way you can run from 40 Wall Street to the Woolworth Building to City Hall in 5 minutes. Still, I did like how the system was able to detect how fast I was ""running"" and how at least captured the feeling of running through a city. Overall, this activity definitely made what was otherwise a tedious activity pretty interesting. Workout intensity of this one was a 5 of 5, but for fun I give it a 3 of 5.

4) Jump Rope: This is another new activity, and it's a winner. It's a twist on jump rope. You start out by holding your hand as if you're holding a jump rope, and an energetic beat will start playing. You'll see icons of two feet under you, and need to jump to the beat while matching the pattern of feet (either two close together, two far apart, or just the left or the right). Even on Easy mode I was wiped out after this one, but I found it immensely fun. 5 of 5 for workout intensity, 5 of 5 for fun.

5) Stomp It: This game is very similar to ""Light Race"" from last year's version, where you stand in the middle of something similar to a ""Simon"" game and move your feet to correctly hit the colored panels under your feet. This year, they've improved it by matching the colored lights to a beat and give you a visual cue of which panel will light up next, so it's more like a step aerobics exercise (versus  last year's version where you were just randomly stomping). You still need a ton of room for this one, and if your Kinect doesn't have a clear view of your feet at all times it's not going to be fun for you at all. This one was a 4 of 5 for intensity, and a 4 of 5 for fun.

""Workouts"", represented by the red icons, are basically traditional calisthenics, cardio, and strength building types of activities that a trainer would do with you at a gym. The workouts are categorized by the part of the body or the exercise goal you want to focus on. They include the following (the number of exercise routines under each is in parentheses):

1) Arms (12)
2) Abs (13)
3) Cardio (10)
4) Toning (9)
5) Back (12)
6) Sports Preparation (8)
7) Glutes (12)
8) Health (3)
9) Legs (12)

They've got all the basic exercises covered pretty well. For example, when I selected the first workout under ""Arms"", the exercises were knee push-ups and slow mountain climbs. A typical exercise under ""Abs"" will have you doing all kinds of crunches, from basic crunches, to V knees to the chest, to up and down planks.

As in the first version, to the left of the screen you'll observe your virtual trainer doing the exercise, using the proper technique. You'll see an image of yourself to the right of the trainer. I really liked how the cartoon trainer and the cartoony you looked very similar, both in terms of size and visual style.  As I said, new to this version is the ability to see your arms and legs clearly, so you can work on matching the trainer's body position and moves precisely. There are also visual cues that'll show you exactly where your head should be and where your feet should be. Finally, there's music so that you can time your reps to the beat perfectly (you'd be surprised at how many workout games just play random music and don't bother to match it to your reps).

A woman's voice will talk your through all the exercises, calling out instructions and encouragement. Regarding the latter, I found that she tended to err a little on the ""overly encouraging"" side--even when I wasn't doing the exercises right, she'd be shouting out compliments and encouragement. Happily, the motion detection is definitely spot-on--after the workout you'll see precisely what percentage of the workout you nailed, and I found it to be remarkably accurate.

""Classes"", represented by the purple icons, are very similar to workouts. You go through a series of set exercises, you have a virtual cartoon trainer who will demonstrate the proper moves, and you'll control the cartoony ""you"" standing next to him or her as you try to match the moves. The difference is that while ""workouts"" were like generic exercises you might do at the gym, ""classes"" all follow a specific theme, such as a certain style of dance, a boxing training session, and even a military bootcamp. Here are the options and the number of routines in each:

1) Africa Rhythms (12)
2) Boot Camp (6)
3) Hip Hop (12)
4) Cardio Boxing (14)
5) Destination: Bollywood (12)
6) Yoga (4)
7) Latin Dance (12)
8) Zen Energy (8)

I tried the boot camp one first. Sure enough, you and your virtual trainer (a gruff drill sergeant) are in the field of a military boot camp complete with a helicopter and occasional explosions happening around you. Even at the easy levels, you're taken through a grueling set of exercises, from running to ""Olympian squats"" to ""stun attacks"" to push ups. The trainer stays in character throughout, shouting instructions to you amid various random interjections (""you're tired? I don't care!"", ""does it hurt? Good!"").

I also tried the Bollywood one. Like the rest of the dance-themed classes, it had different levels with names like ""Learn it"", ""Rehearse It"", ""Speed It Up"", and ""Show it Off"". I tried the beginning level, and it brought me through some very authentic Bollywood dance steps with names like ""Bolly Arms"", ""Aarti Step"" and ""Blossom Step"". The moves were very authentic. I wouldn't say this part of the game is exactly Dance Central, but it's not bad either.

Overall, I'd say this is a worthwhile purchase if you're serious about using your Xbox for fitness and exercise. Those who purchased last year's version (especially if you purchased a lot of the DLC) may find a lot of what's in this year's version redundant. But I'd say there are enough improvements to make it a worthwhile purchase. I loved the improved avatar, enjoyed the new activities they added, and appreciate the fact that they didn't skimp this year on the number of exercises you can do before resorting to purchasing more as downloadable content. From the title, I'm assuming Ubisoft intends to release one of these every year; here's hoping that they continue to innovate the series moving forward and don't get lazy and rest on past laurels."
2594,4,"I was given this game and system for a gift. I have enjoyed it and recommend it. I have back problems and I am unable to really do alot of harsh exercises, with the Wii Fit I am able to have some physical activity while working for my health. I have not had it for about a month but have already noticed some improvement with flexibility and health. I recommend for anyone looking for a little fun while working out."
2595,4,"i REALLY liked it , i didn't play the 1st saint row so this is kinda my 1st & i thought it'll never be as good as GTA but it was cool ."
2596,4,"I'm tired of throwing my money for the same game year to year.  The new PS3 version is good, not great.  The graphics seem better as far as stadiums, players, crowds, however...

#2 pet peeve the interface menus, the scoreboard, info boxes, pop ups, stats, etc., all look like old non-streamlined graphics.

#1 pet peeve the frame rate is slow as heck, real jumpy, not smooth as I expected,  this is clearly noticable.  I'm like what is this?  Geez!  I haven't even gone online yet!

I must admit I am particular about these kind of things, but like madden for even PC 2007 were gorgeous the menus, the interface, the music as far as football music classics NFL films music, why the step down in a HUGE 20th anniversary year?

I think what EA continues to screw up is this they have certain parts of each version that are more brilliant than the others, why not copy the good stuff carry it over tweak everything until the game is near a 10.  You don't have to come out with entirely different everything everytime.  Stop working on 1000 man hours of new TD celebrations for the kids, tweak the good stuff this game should be a 9 or better everytime.  This game is a 7/8 at best.

I hope my favorite NBA LIVE franchise steps up, but Madden gets so much more attention, and this is what they spit out, my hopes aren't up.  Really disappointed.  Rent it die hards before you throw your money away."
2597,4,"Good game for remembering life as a kid. I haven't figured out how to save it though so every time I die I have to restart the game, which gets old. Shipping was fast and the game arrived in good condition, no issues playing it. Not for everyone though."
2598,4,"Let me start by saying that although I have played the rythem instrument games before, this was my first actual purchase of one for myself, so the bundle was the right choice for me, since I did not have any of the previous instruments from either the Rock Band series or the Guitar Hero series. I am writing this review as a newcomer to the genre, so I won't have the same complaints or praises as someone comparing this to the previous installments of the series or the competition.

I am very impressed with this version of Guitar Hero. The story mode is completely lame, but still fun, and necessary to unlock all the songs in the game. At least it is easy, though. Ridiculously easy so far, even for me. They want you to unlock all the songs and play the game all the way through, which is a good thing because it gets you to where WoR really shines: Party Mode.

Party Mode is available right from the start, but unlocking every song in the game requires a story mode playthrough. Party mode is a no-fail option where any of the 4 instruments can drop in or out at any time and you can either make your own playlist or just let it shuffle through all the songs you have in your library (including purchased or imported songs from other games).

The only thing that really ticked me off about this bundle is that it came with the Guitar Hero 5 guitar and not the new Warriors of Rock Guitar. This means for someone like me, I had to work really hard to find an affordable solution to add the very cool new guitar as my second guitar.

However, the instruments that do come with the bundle are great, hold up well, and yes, everything but the Mic is wireless on the PS3. The guitars and drums turn off after a few minutes of being idle, which saves the battery life. We have been having ""band jam sessions"" for a couple months now, and haven't changed the batteries in any of the instruments yet."
2599,4,"Assassin's Creed III may be the third main title in the Assassin's Creed series, but it is the fifth over all, that of course is not including any of the handheld games. Ubisoft has done a good job of stripping away some of the unnecessary fat that was starting to thicken up the series in game play and mechanics, but also leave the game with some new stuff to try and make Assassin's Creed III a little different than what we have been playing the last few years. The downside of this comes with much more bugs and glitches in the game as a whole, more than any of the other games in the series have had altogether. Ubisoft said a small team was developing this title ever sense they finished up the second game while other teams worked on Brotherhood and Revelations and once those were done they all came together to finish three. I can not believe that at all with some of the problems this game has.

Assassin's Creed III, just like all the other games takes the story to a time in our history that no other games ever tread upon and it does a remarkable job of making it fun to play in and tells a relatively well crafted story. The ambition that Ubisoft puts forth in overcoming the challenges for game play and mechanics in this series is defiantly impressive to say the least. This time around the game takes players to the American Revolutionary War as you see some of America's earliest and most historical events through the eyes of the once again upstart assassin's guild.

The modern day world is the backdrop to the series, although everything that Desmond is learning within the animus from his ancestors is to save the world. A lot of the end game of the past Assassin's Creed games have done nothing but add more questions to the story as a whole in the modern day in the series. Finally after all this time there was a lot of closer to Desmond and the fight between the modern day assassins and Templars. In addition the whole saving the world aspect that was sprinkled in during modern day missions after the second game has also been tied up. All of this however feels like it was quickly slapped together and shoehorned into the game. Maybe it is because answers to long lasting mysteries, like those that this series creates are never as satisfying as one likes to hope.

The modern day story with Desmond still takes a backseat in Assassin's Creed III much like it was with all the others, however there is much more done with Desmond this time around more than any of the other games. Revelations tried bring more out of Desmond's story, but failed miserable with horrible first-person platform puzzle levels. In Assassin's Creed III, Desmond has full on missions he must complete, albeit the reasoning is limited, but the fact that you get to take control of Desmond on missions that almost rival those of the regular missions we have come to love from all the games. It is about time you really get the feeling that Desmond is a true assassin. As he hides in crowds, climbs buildings and fights his way out of trouble with guards.

Assassin's Creed III serves up some daddy issues between Desmond and his father, which at the start is quite annoying, but mixing that with everything going on for Desmond it starts to get its hooks into you as they learn to band together while facing their differences. It also makes there feel like more of a connection between Desmond and the real star of this game, Connor Kenway. He was born of an English man and a Native American woman. He and his tribe live in the Northeast of America during the Revolutionary War. Connor has been caught in the middle of a lot in his years as a young adult, between the assassins and Templars and that of his native people and the European colonists. Connor is quickly thrown in after his first taste of knowledge of the apple and he never looks back as he learns to become an assassin. His unwavering honor for justice and for protecting his people is what makes him such a great character has he has the Revolutionary War pushed upon him.

American history always glorified the founding fathers of our nation, but of course the Revolutionary War was like that of any war, which was full of compromises to bad situations at best. Assassin's Creed III lays some of that out for us, which humanizes some of the icons that we as Americans have looked up to our entire lives. It is an interesting way to look at how the war went at the same time really draws you into the game. Historical moments have always been a huge part of the Assassin's Creed games, but in Assassin's Creed III Connor's story is neatly tied into the actual war itself in ways that the series has rarely approached. Not only are you witnessing historical events like The Boston Tea Party, but Connor actually takes action in all of them. It works well for the most part, but then there are other times such as Connor riding the horse that Paul Revere rode to warn people that the British were coming, situations like that felt shoehorned in, as if Paul Revere was too incompetent to do it on his own. It would have been better to follow along behind him and have to take out any redcoats along the way.

The geography of Assassin's Creed III is very important to mention here. The series spent the majority of its time in eras and places with large buildings, but Assassin's Creed III look a large step back and that weighed on a lot of peoples mind leading up to the games release. Many people were unsure if climbing and rooftop running would be as fun in cities like Boston and New York in the mid 1700's with so many low standing buildings and they had the same fear about the tree top running in the open wilderness between cities. It has been a long time since the very first game, but there were some areas in that game that had no tall buildings and in the open areas of the first game between cities hardly had anything at all to climb and that worked out just fine. So it is no real surprise that free running through the towns in Assassin's Creed III works great and is still a lot of fun. Also the treetop running in the wild is a blast too. Going from tree branch to tree branch is very fluid and works without any hassle. It would have been nice to be able to use more trees in the cities as well while free running.

Over the past few games Ubisoft has added a lot of things to do on the side, some might say to the point of over stuffing the player with content, much like some of the issues with Revelations. However in Assassin's Creed III Ubisoft has take out some of the extra and streamline other content. There is still plenty to do on the side in the third game, although some of it doesn't feel as fulfilling. There are some liberation missions that you can start up and when you get into these situations they are usually very easy and quick to get through making them feel almost nonexistent. The game does offer some side missions you can do to buildup the homestead, which is the land Connor lives on. Doing these missions will have these people come stay on your land and you can use their goods for things you need or to be able to make things. It is a different approach to the whole banking thing and building up workshops in the last couple of Assassin's Creed games. It works well and makes the homestead feel cozy when running around hunting animals and being able to stop and talk to these people for more than just to get something out of them. Most of the disconnect from the side missions is brought on by the newer version of fast travel system. A lot of areas you can simply jump from where ever you are to the edge of the city and into the next area, were as the fast travel system of the last couple games you had to find tunnels which made the things available to do around the areas more accessible while running around.

This is the third straight Assassin's Creed game to offer a unique multiplayer and Ubisoft continues to build onto the multiplayer in each iteration. When the multiplayer was first brought to the players in Brotherhood I quickly fell in love with it. It was something completely different and refreshing from anything else out there. Now even though the main concept of the multiplayer has not changed, Ubisoft has added in many things to try to keep players playing online. Now I hardly touched the multiplayer in Revelations, so some of this might have been added in that game. You can customize your favorite characters in many different ways, such as clothing, colors and weapon type. There is even a new sound cues for when you have your target insight or when the person targeting you is closing in on you. There is also a new co-op structure to the multiplayer called ""Wolf Pack"". I have not yet played this mode, but it appears to be a wave based horde mode for you and your friends to assassinate bad guys.

Assassin's Creed III had big shoes to fill and it did a good job of it, ignoring many of the games glitches and bugs. They story was told very well, although it had a very slow start to it. The characters are well developed, the scenery is amazing and the idea of taking control of an assassin during the Revolutionary War was great. It may not be Assassin's Creed at its finest, Assassin's Creed III had some missteps throughout the game, but the characters, story and gameplay make it easy to turn a blind eye to a lot of it and the mechanics are successful enough for introducing some new game play elements."
2600,4,This holds my 3ds xl very snugly and its a nice clean looking case. My only issue is the game holder doesn't work very well. The slots are too tight and you cant really get 4 across. I instead bought a 6 game plastic case holder for cheap and throw that in the top net pocket.
2601,4,"This is much improved from the previous version-- But they can still do better.

Improvements:
Old Zumba: Raimbow colored black-and-white copies of people were doing moves. You were being scored, but you had no idea how. Menus were terrible to get through.
New Zumba: They have avatars. Stars track your ""skill"" progress. Menus are a little easier to navigate with Kinect.

The Unimproved:
- You still have no idea which songs are in which lessons. This is particularly irritating in this one because I would really like to workout to particular songs sometimes... and I don't want to do one song. I want to do the full class.
- It doesn't recognize me right away. I have to sign in. In the last Zumba, it would also sign me out every now and again unexpectedly... and it would ruin my progress for awards because I wasn't signed in... or I would have to pause the game and sign in again). I have no idea if I remained signed in for the entire workout in the new one because it doesn't have my name at the top of  the screen like the old one. So if I walked away... I'd be SOL and unaware. (I like my awards!).

New Problems:
The avatars occasionally seem to get from one move to the next in an unnatural way. There is less instruction, but there is a box showing you the upcoming moves so you can prepare.

Overall:
I really like this game. I just had a baby and I have already lost all of my baby wight. I get a lot of complements and I tell people I'm using Zumba on the Kinect and lifting my baby! I REALLY like one of the tango songs. I think they did an outstanding job with their instruction on this one."
2602,4,"Tsuyoshi Kawahito has made a great sim for any flight enthusiast. I was looking for a good Vietnam flight sim, and this was pretty much the only one that I found. I gave it a try, and its pretty good. It can be made easy enough to fly without flight controllers, or hard enough to give a challenge. One of the best things about this sim is that it was built to be expanded, and it is very, very simple to add aircraft and weapons and the like into this thing. This is a must have in my opinion. There is a sequel, Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam, but I chose to get this one because there is an addon that gives many, many more aircraft and missions and better effects, and makes this into a first-class flight simulator - which is Yankee Air Pirate 2 (yankeeairpirate.net). Definately a great sim. Thanks so much to TK!"
2603,4,"took me a while to figure out and work through the missions, but kept me busy from beginning to end."
2604,4,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not because I was concerned it was a first person shooter which I can't play (they make me feel sick).  I was really excited though that while it ""can"" be an FPS, it can also be played as a 3rd person shooter.  I had no problems at all, I really loved that you can create and customize your own character.  I prefer to play as a character I create rather than some predetermined character which is usually a generic looking white guy.

Anyway, I was really pleasantly surprised by this game.  I took a risk on it, unsure of whether or not I would like it but I really did.  Theres good and bad though, so here's my thoughts, first the bad:

1. The main quest is pretty short I think and you can knock it out quick, but you don't want to because one of the drawbacks of the game is that once its done, the game is done.  There's no freeplay after that last main quest mission.  I would have liked to have been able to go do more exploration or quests after the final main one or even to talk to people afterwards to find out their thoughts at that point.

2. There's a real lack in different bad things to kill, I count roughly a dozen or so different creatures and that's about it and you see most of the different creatures pretty early on in the game, so there's really not a lot of surprises.  Further, I found I could kill pretty much anything I ran up against fairly early in the game, so the stuff didn't really get more challenging.

3. I think there's a disconnect between levels and experience.  Either theres not enough levels or you get thru them too quickly.  I found myself maxed out at level 20 maybe 1/3 of the way thru the game.  That meant that I didn't see any motivation or benefit really to continuing to do certain activities as there was no experience.

4. There's a real limit to how much cool stuff there is in the game.  Again you see the same stuff over and over and there's not a lot of rare items, nor do the items get better as you progress.  That would have made more sense to me, better weapons and armor as you progress and encounter harder and harder foes.  Also, because of this, I found myself with lots of lots of caps (in game money) with nothing worthwhile to spend it on really, this took away motivation to bother to gather things because I didn't need the money anyway.

5. I get that there's only so much they can do, but still, every house seems to have the same internal layout, the tunnels all look the same inside, etc, just the configurations change.  Its not a big problem, but its consistent with weapons, armor and creatures in terms of a lack of real diversification.

6. There's a lack of diversification of faces, maybe a dozen or two and so you tend to see the same faces over and over, especially on the raiders.

7. Shooting when you're not in VATS, especially on a PC is a little tricky, but not impossible.

8. I would have liked to have seen some romance options, but that's just me, a romantic at heart.

9. It ends kind of abruptly.  I would have expected the last mission to be a really tough battle royale kind of a ""the biggest test"" of the game if you will, but it wasn't.  That's consistent with the fact that nothing really gets any harder or more challenging throughout, it all kind of stays at the same level even as you get slightly better weapons or much better skills or attributes, really it just gets easier as you go so for me, the end was really easy and I wasn't expecting it to end when it did.

and the good:

1. I really enjoyed this game and felt sad when it ended, I think because it really does have a great story that draws you in and truly makes you feel connected.

2. The voice work is nice.  Liam Neeson plays the father.  Malcom McDowell as the President, both have amazing voices.

3. While more diversity of music and radio station choices would have been nice, I did enjoy listening to the music and news of Galaxy News Radio.  The old style music was a neat contrast against the wasteland.

4. The world is very big and the environment is beautiful and detailed.  I would have liked to have seen it be a fully usable/destructable world like in some other games, but walking around, especially at sunrise or sunset, this is a really cool looking place with lots to see, lots to explore.

5. Tons of little side quests ranging from small nothing things to bigger things, so plenty to do.

6. I liked the karma system and how people respond to you is based on that.  Its not something you set in a window like I'm going to have X karma and be evil, its more based on your choices which I think is how it should be.

7. VATS makes shooting pretty easy and the slow motion of body parts flying everywhere when you hit something is a neat bonus.

So for whatever shortcomings the game has, I highly highly recommend it.  It plays out more as an RPG (role playing game) than a pure shooter.  You're not just shooting at stuff with no reason, this has a real story and you're a character in a world that you feel connected with.  There's a bunch of DLC add on content too but I didn't buy into that.  So if you're good with 3rd person shooter games (or 1st person) like GTA, Saints Row, Dragon Age, etc, you may very much like this one."
2605,4,"I was excited to try a new gamepad but this is not keeping me excited.  Please note this is a wired pad, so you lose some convenience but It will save replacing batteries until you try using it.  Oh and no you won't be talking to your friends with this pad. On the plus side, despite previous reviews, we've had no problems with the buttons.  It looks like whatever issue was resolved.  The controller handles nicely and is a fighting pad for different hand use, thus the size.  The line up of the buttons is spot on.  The controller is slightly different than pictured.  The logo is an image in the plastic, not metal nor does it look metal.  Also the surface is smooth and does not feel or resemble leather grain.  Other than that, we are happy with it!"
2606,4,Game is great.  Collector's edition isn't really worth though.
2607,4,I bought this game in 2003. I played it until I got hopelessly stuck and never returned to playing it. Come to find out it has a pretty good glitch in it right after the dancehall speaker battle. If you kill all the guys you get stuck on the upper floors which is where I quit. I ended up finding the cheat codes to it and put myself into the next level and played through the game. It does get repetitive but It was a lot of fun!!! It really reminded me of an older version of Bayonetta.
2608,4,"UPDATE 6-19-2013
I want to clear up some misconceptions about Fallout 3. First, it WILL work on Windows 7. I am using it on my current, best laptop. I have spent a few hours looking for solutions, as I have had many of the same problems using it from a Windows XP laptop to a new, better Windows 7 laptop. I run it in compatibility mode for XP Service Pack 2 AND as Administrator. I run it in windowed mode, moving it over to my 2nd bigger computer monitor. I have the GOTY edition and I have about 20 mods running on it.
This laptop runs 2.4ghz, 8G RAM, AMD Vision. It's been two weeks and no problems running it.
However, it has been frustrating for many reasons. Eventually Fallout 3 as considered 'DONE' by Bethesda. The last update 1.7, was a few years ago. From my understanding and research, they haven't had anyone work on it since. I have the non-Steam version (thank goodness). It makes things much easier. I have no clue how to help with other versions. I believe Fallout 3 is one of the
BEST games.
Important: I would advise to learn all one can about modding. It's easy with Nexus Mod Manager; it installs mods for you, without problem for the most part. Modders have created new quests, towns, and other areas of the game that add to Fallout. After playing through the main quests and even much of the side ones; there is still plenty of new content that makes plenty of good reason to play again. Who says one would have to even follow the main quests. I have a mod that allows you to SKIP the boring, 15 minute intro you're forced to play every time a new character is made.
In my opinion, if they took the game and updated with them with current tech and graphics, they could 'add' more to the game.
In addition, Fallout New Vegas is equally done and there are mods for that game that add to the playability and enjoyment of the game.

UPDATE 6-2-2013

I have had this game for a long time. I had it on an HP Entertainment Laptop running Vista. NO problems playing the game.
I have the GOTY edition and all DLC's worked fine as well. Sadly, the motherboard got fried and I had to get a new laptop.
Wanting to keep up with tech and all, I now have a HP Pavillion dv6 that I've had for almost 3 years.

AMD Turion 2 P520 Dual-Core 2.4Ghz
8G RAM Max for this model.
64 Bit Windows 7

I was able to play the game again on this one without problems. However, I found that the game and Windows 7 do not like each other at all.
It quite working. Spent hours looking online to fix the issue. Not much luck. Gave up.
Started trying again in May 2013.

Installed both base game and DLC. Crashed. Won't start.

Installed base game. Installed Patch 1.7 from Bethesda website. Crashed. Won't start.

Installed base game. Started. Went to Games for Windows Live option. Signed in. Started to update the game, started 1.7 patch AGAIN, had to update that because it wouldn't let me go any further. Stuck on black screen with frozen 'working circle'. Left it alone for hours; just in case. Open task manager: both update and Fallout 3 'Not Responding'. Ended both processes. Tried to start base game again.
Crash. Won't start.

The only luck I've had to far on a Windows 7 computer that EASILY played the base game only with NO patch. From what I've learned Bethesda will drop any game after their done with it. Maybe get a few more patches or updates. After that they toss it in gaming limbo.

They did the same thing for Skyrim. Hearthfire was a scam and only 2 DLC's. They've stated they MIGHT fix future problems.

The problem is Bethesda. They are NOT putting in the time and effort into making a quality game. There should have been a patch that made this game easily playable on Windows 7 and 8; including the DLC's.
Fallout 3 is a great game. It's open ended so you don't have to follow the quest line. I use MODS for Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim and that makes it almost a new game.
Bethesda did a lot right, what they did wrong; they did on a huge scale. Try getting someone on the phone to fix a problem or explain something is almost impossible. Everyone wants to point you to the forums to fix it yourself. Everyone who uses a computer doesn't have the same knowledge of working files and such.
FINAL ASSESSMENT:
IF you decide to get the game; make sure your computer exceeds the Minimum requirements. It works on XP and above as I have had it running on all those OS. Sure there's some minor tweaking to get it to work, but it's very easy to do."
2609,4,"I like it, you can save some money in promotions or searching in amazon, in the official blizzard page it's always ""available"" but with ""full price"".
Wanted more for an expansion"
2610,4,"I have gone backwards in my delta force experience having bought DF#-landwarrior first and then buying up the first two just to have more missions to play. It is certainly been worth it! All the delta force games take place out doors which makes them different. It's realistic action were you have to snipe your way around the perimeter to make your way into a camp to complete your mission objective. Of the three delta force games i own i think df2 has the most original and interesting missions.
You like missions? Well in this game you get over 40 of them! I wish rainbow six would give you that many. These missions are part of two campaigns that form a certain story line or you can play them as ""quick missions"" in any order on your own. Many of those missions are also available in multiplayer so you can play coop with a buddy. The missions take place in a variety of weather conditions day and night and the challenge is being able to take out all the terrorists because that one guy you missed will take you out and remember one shot kills! Sure you can respawn but that just means starting the mission all over again from the beginning. That is the challenge in delta force the sheer number of combatants you need to take out and the large area in which they use. For example in one of my favorite missions there is a downed pilot hiding in this snowy wilderness. To fly him out safely you need to take out a camp containing at least 25 of the enemy and destroy three SAMs. Getting most of the terrorist scum is easy as you just take a position up top and start picking them off but it's hard to get them all and some are out where you can't see them easily. So patience is key because as soon as you leave your cover somebody will get you. It took me a while to complete that mission and twice i was 99% finished just having blown up the SAMs only to get sniped.
You don't have a huge number of weapons to choose from but what you have is fantastic and you'll find yourself using one of the sniper rifles or the M4 machine gun which has a grenade launcher. You won't use your hand gun much and you have the choice of delayed or frag grenades. Satchels are available for blowing up large things like those SAM sites and you can use extra ammo or a vest as one of your options. Because methodical, longer range warfare is the order you have a really nice alternative to games like rainbow and half life were most of your action is confined to a small space. It's the pace of the game that i really like and it's a blast to pick off some terrorist from 300 meters away.
The multiplayer is a whole new ball game because you're going to have quite a few people trying to get you. The last time i played at nova world there were 900 people in there so you never have to wait for some action. You can play deathmatch where every man is for himself or team death match. Capture the flag is a blast. You really can never tire of this game!
Drawbacks? Well the graphics are not an improvement over delta force one though they are pretty cool. You do need to update the game all the way because there are a few problems that needed to be fixed and you'll want to maximize your resolution. The game can be just a bit choopy and sluggish at times which brings me to why i only have a 4* rating.
In all the delta force games you are placed in an outdoor enviroment that is enormous. Often you will have to run for a minute or two just to engage the enemy or reach their camp. In all these games you feel like you are spending too much time running  around and that is especially a problem in multiplyer were you run for ever only to get killed and have to go back to where you were . DF3-landwarrior remedies this problem a little by making the characters run faster but in this game you seem to plod along at a slow pace. That's especially true when running up and down steep mountains.
Over all delta force2 is a fantastic realistic shooter with unique characteristics. It's a great compliment to some of the other great games out there. I own rainbow 6 and rouge spear and this makes a nice alternative. Certainly the price is right.

2611,4,"Smackdown:Just Bring It for the PS2 and Smackdown 1 and 2 for the PS1 are better. But it is nothing compared to WWF Raw for the XBOX. Raw for the XBOX is better than any of them. But if you haven't got a PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube yet this is a must get game. Gameplay is good it just takes a day or maybe a little more to get use to. If you want to save money rent it and smackdown 1 or 2 and see which one you would want to have the most."
2612,4,They sound great but can be uncomfortable when worn for 5-6 hours.
2613,4,"This is one of the better story-mode seek-n'find games I've played. Not difficult and its nice that the items you are searching for can change each time you play the game.  Fun game to put you in the Halloween mood. But....

There are spelling errors. I was looking for a 'tub', when the hint directed me to a 'tube'. There are a couple of others, but use the 'hint' icon to locate the item.

I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't like the vagueness of how you are to utilize certain items. You'll find all of the items on the list, have one in the inventory and you are supposed to guess how it is used. This was actually quite annoying. Just use the 'hint' icon to tell you where to put things."
2614,4,"These were really good, I upgraded to a different pair and gave these to my roommate, since he used it more (stole) than I did."
2615,4,"I read some average reviews on these so I wasn't sure about buying.  But the price was good and they looked sturdier then ones we got before and they stepped on and bam, we there went 20 bucks.  So we got these for cheap money.  The kids love them on the Xbox.  They use them on Xbox live all the time.  We order again so they all have a set."
2616,4,"For EA's first time out of the box with a fitness game this is excellent.  I was a little apprehensive when I first saw EA was putting this out because while Wii Fit is pretty fun I don't feel that it really helps you get in shape or strenghtens.  But after reading mostly positive reviews from critics and users I decided to give it a try.  Must say I was really surprised the first time I used it how sweaty and weak kneed I was.  Since I play tennis or run, sometimes both the same day, at least every other day I felt my lower body was in pretty good shape.  But after the second day my legs were so sore I had trouble getting up and down the steps to my apartment.  I see some reviewers complaining about the movements not being recognized even when you feel you're doing them correctly.  I did have some trouble the first time I used it but now on my 4th day of workouts I've pretty much got the controls and movements down.  It just takes a little getting used to and making sure you use the correct technique.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the resistance band that comes with it is really bad.  No matter how much I fold it over I still can't feel anything when doing the upper body work.  Best to go buy some decent bands at the sports store.  Also there is virtually no core excercises.  I do see that EA is already working on an expansion pack for later this year that will incorporate core work.  All in all a pretty solid workout that just needs a few tweaks to perfect."
2617,4,"Pokemon Leaf Green and its counterpart, Fire Red, are both excellent remakes of the original Pokemon games (released in the U.S. as Pokemon Red and Blue, but in Japan as Red, Green, and Blue).  However, as with every GBA-era Pokemon game, there were SEVERAL counterfeit cartridges made that have been circulated into the Amazon Marketplace.

If your game's label is not reflective (meaning it doesn't have a metallic sheen to it), you have a counterfeit product that will not work and may not function properly.  There are several other ways to identify products, and I highly suggest that, should you purchase one of the GBA-era (Generation III) Pokemon games, you check to make sure the product is authentic.  If it is not, you can very easily use Amazon's Customer Service department to get your money back for a counterfeit product.  Most sellers are, however, unaware that what they're marketing is not a genuine product, so it is up to the buyer to be vigilant."
2618,4,I have always been a fan of the metal gear solid series and this was a good addition to the games.
2619,4,Really like the new battle system but not the best story for a Final Fantasy game
2620,4,"I was a big fan of the original Portal and looked forward to this one with great anticipation.  The game is indeed clever, extending it's novel use of physics with the addition of lasers, paint-gels and tractor beams.  Playing for an hour or so each day I was able to complete single-player in less than a week.  Maybe it was just the intervening years, but the original just seemed more of a challenge.  This one almost seemed to be one rails, shoot a portal jump in, get expelled.  Entertaining enough but at the end I was left feeling as though there should have been more to it.

As of right now it really has no replay appeal.  Valve is reported to be releasing a free DLC this summer, hopefully we'll see the addition of more levels, timed challenges, ability to design and share levels."
2621,4,"Awesome game with very emotional storyline. As many of telltale games, it incorporates a very minimal gameplay with point and click approach. The conversations are very engaging with so many options to choose from, some with severe consequences. The characters are funny and each has unique personality. The only take back is that this version is overpriced. The digital option or the PC option could be much cheaper."
2622,4,"Intro:

Crysis 3 is the third game in a cool franchise of post apocalyptic alien shooters and is arguably the most enjoyable, in my opinion. The Crysis games are not your typical bro-shooters, like Call of Duty or Halo, that everyone plays. Instead, they are a mix of loose storytelling and badass gameplay set in a crazy, and hopefully fake, future on Earth.

Story:

The story of the Crysis games is set in the distant future after an alien race has invaded and destroyed most of Earth. Full cities have become forests or gravel wastelands and are crawling with alien predators looking to hunt you down. You do not need to play the previous two games in order to know what is going on in this game because it gives you a brief recap at the beginning; though it makes it more meaningful if you have played them. You play as a character named Prophet who is in control of a cyborg-like body armor suit and are tasked with (you probably guessed it already) saving the world from the aliens. Crysis 3 improves the story from the last game by giving you a sidekick named Psycho to interact with and make you feel much more human. This actually makes the player care more for the story than in the last few games because they no longer carelessly drop you into a level and give you an objective to complete.

Presentation:

The graphics of the Crysis series has been the most talked about part over the past several years. Each time a new Crysis game releases, all people can talk about is how they have never seen a more beautiful game, and this game is no different. Not only is this game beautiful and realistic, but it has some of the most stunning scenes to admire and be a part of. I can only imagine what this game must be like on a super powered PC instead of a PS3.

Gameplay:

I loved the gameplay of Crysis 3 for many reasons. The ability to switch between super strong body armor and an invisible cloak instantly returns in this game and can change any fire fight into a different experience for every player. Sometimes you might feel like stealthily creeping through a level and silently assassinating enemies, or maybe you just acquired a big gun and feel like going in guns-a-blazing with your souped-up body armor; either way it is fun to try the levels differently. Each level is made up of a humongous area, both in length and height. You can creep underneath buildings or climb them, in most cases, which adds to the multitude of options in which you can complete each level. You also have several different weapons in which you can upgrade, as well as body suit upgrades, and different types of ammo for weapons, including your predator bow (which was my favorite weapon by the way).

photo 131014-0951-45.jpg

The Verdict: 8.0 out of 10.0

This game was honestly just really fun to play. The story is not super enticing, but it is set on a really interesting future version of our planet. The graphics are stunning which was to be expected of a Crysis game. The gameplay is what really pulled me in for my 8 hours of playtime through the campaign mode. I loved trying to beat levels in different ways by using different ammo for my bow, trying to go invisibly under a level, or just turning on my body armor and running up to everyone firing my assault rifle like crazy. If you need a good first person shooter that is different from your typical bro-shooter, this is the game for you. It was exciting from start to finish, and you won't regret the experience."
2623,4,Great to have as they are much longer than the originals that came with the PS4.
2624,4,"While this is not my favorite game--the Reality Show part had me frequently confused, and not in a good way, I was actually satisfied with the character of Sonny Joon.

Again, not my favorite, but they can't all be my favorite."
2625,4,"First off ill start by saying I have been playing this game for only 2 days, however, I have played it enough to know the good and the bad.

I started playing with a monk and my friend was playing as a witch doctor. These two are really fun and make a good 2 person team.
(that being said this game is best multiplayer and it works like a charm, but it is still fun single player)
The game itself is very fun and moves quickly, we could be searching for a crown for a quest, all the while taking down huge masses of enemies.

Diablo 3 has not gotten boring yet, I just want to play more and more! But I am planning on switching characters soon to see what others are like.

Pros
-Quick action and fun
-EXCELLENT MULTIPLAYER!
-havent gotten board yet
-tons of stuff to do
-online multiplayer
-ability to switch characters later in the game

Cons
-There are some glitches, but there has already been an update
-sometimes things don't work (Health bars on enemies for one) But this is being fixed.

Overall Id say it is a great game to buy if you are looking to chill out with some friends or slay on your own!"
2626,4,"I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.

A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -

HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.

It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]

It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.

Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.

External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.

The bundles-

The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldnt be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven't included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).

Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -

Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.

Current bundles -

Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.

Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...

Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.

Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.

Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.

Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.

FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.

Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.

Legacy bundles-

Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.

Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.

Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.

Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4."
2627,4,Works great.  Kid loves it
2628,4,"Its really good but not great.  It has a unique type of gameplay to it.  Combat that is turned based, unique Anime graphics, decent storyline... but it gets old fast."
2629,4,"I totally suck at fighting games so I could really only use half the functionality of this game. The online play is far too competitive and the skill levels were astronomically high; it was impossible to find people at my level (ground floor).

With that said; the game played flawlessly. Controls and animations felt responsive and logical, the game's music and sound was exciting and kept the action movie, the art direction is to die for, and the enormous roster (now expanded by newer versions of the game) were awesome.

I only wish I was better. :(
If you suck like I do, I don't know if I could recommend this game, however."
2630,4,"Another solid game from ubisoft.
It has solid gameplay very cool story, but side missions feel kind repetitive.
Overall a good game."
2631,4,"As a tennis game, Sega Superstars Tennis is a hit-and-miss. The characters swing at the ball right after you make the motion rather than during. You can't really add in slice on the ball, either. But this was supposed to be a VIDEO GAME to begin with, so we should be expecting cool features that will impact this game.

Sure, there's your average Single and Multiplayer tennis matches and randomly arranged tournaments, but there's more meat in everywhere else.

The Adventure mode is where you end up trying the game's many gimmicks in tennis. Those gimmicks then get implemented into unlockable minigames. There are also tennis matches that also try to represent the games they are based on.

The minigames are the highlights of this whole game, mainly because that's what the game lives on top of. You get games based off of Sonic, Jet Set Radio, Super Monkey Ball, Virtua Squad (aka Virtua Cop), Space Harrier, etc. The games are actually pretty faithful, considering the tennis-like gameplay.

Space Harrier is a lot like the arcade classic itself: You shoot off enemies, and eventually, a dragon comes as a little boss.

Virtua Squad is also a lot like its original version.

Puyo Pop Fever is originally a puzzle game, so whatever blob you hit pops here. BUT there's a catch still: If you don't pop them too soon, they will turn into stone.

Sonic the Hedgehog is Sonic at its most basic: You run around collecting rings while dodging robots' projectiles. There are also computer monitors to break for shields or more rings, but that's all there is to it.

Obviously, there are more games, but I'm just giving you an idea of what a few of these are like. If these descriptions aren't sounding very convincing, then let me tell you this: They are just as addicting and fun as arcade games, if not what they are supposed to represent.

Luckily for all of us, the game can be found for a really cheap price (Under $10 or maybe even less than $5). Whenever I take out this game, I would really just go for the minigames. They are that fun."
2632,4,"If you are thinking about buying this game, one thing you need to consider above all else. Ogre Battle series is 70% strategy and 30% Role Playing. With that in mind, here is my review...
Since this is a strategy game more than RP, I gave it 4 Stars for one reason alone. It is not as challenging as the first Ogre Battle (March of the Black Queen). Do not get me wrong, it can be challenging at times and even frustrating at times but the 1st OB was much harder. Example: the bosses in this game are far easier. The first OB for the SNES still stands out in my mind w/ bosses like the Gemini Twins, Diablo, etc.
Another thing to consider... if you are someone who HAS TO have complete control during a fight, than it is a good bet you will *not* enjoy this game. You are basically a general of a battilion giving orders and watching them carry out those orders. The best part of the game is designing your army. You can create a battle unit to emplore all your favorite classes (e.g. Princess which provides extra attack, Lich for brute dark magic, Dragoon for sheer strength, Paladin for his holy attacks, Black Knight for evil attacks, etc.) Combine these characters to make an army you want! And you have plenty of choices, I could waste a lot time just spewing all the characters in this game. You can pair up wizards to make spells combine for a different spell (e.g. Earth and Fire combine for Lava Shot) and more damage. That is the attraction and the strategy part.
The other attraction is the storyline, which is better than the 1st OB. It is not the best storyline across all games, but it is also modifable. Sometimes a small decision you make costs the life of someone dear. There are 3 MAIN endings to the game. There can be small differences in those endings depending on the storyline characters you recruit. This is what gives the game a replay value ...to try different routes in the game and see different endings and different story points and try for other storyline characters ...in my next game I am going for Biske (a werewolf boss).
There are A LOT of nuisances to this game. More than you can imagine. Stuff like removing a character from a unit will lower the morale of the unit ...but you can not see the morale of a unit (i.e. hidden from you). So, read the Internet, DO NOT buy the Prima Strategy Guide unless you really want it. It has some incorrect information and not enough of the good information. Visit OB64 websites, not prima guide! Personal websites, not business websites. I don't know if I can legally post mine here so I am not going to chance it. Also, read the manual and Hugo's Report (in the game). The game has a nice feature of letting you view past movies and good advice - take advantage of that.
It is a GREAT game, but mostly for people who love strategy games like Romance of the III Kingdoms and even RP gamers. I play all types (action, racing, rpg, strategy, fighting), but I will say this... I enjoy strategy and RP games more than fighting (got silly after the 2nd Street Fighter). Someone who loves 1st person shooters and fighting games above all else may be irritated more than enthralled. Then again I probably couldn't count all the hours I have wasted playing Bond in the dorm rooms!
Your decision, not mine but I provided my inputs ...make up your own mind."
2633,4,Lost interest quickly
2634,4,"As a big fan of the original Warship Gunner, I was very happy to pick this version up. The menu screens are a little more streamlined than the original version, but still a bit quirky.

The premise of this game is of a world war in an alternate universe with the same level of technology as real-life Earth had in 1939. There is a fictional nation known as ""Wilkia"" which apparently comprises the lands around the periphery of the Sea of Okhotsk.

It is very similar to the original Warship Gunner in terms of style of play (you're a lone ship against the world) and has what is the most beloved feature of the Warship gunner series - the ability to customize your own warship. The battleships that you're able to build in the game fairly bristle with armaments that real-life battleships would never carry. The main differences from the original is the inclusion of submarines as a warship class as well as the addition of frigates, which in this game are basically larger destroyers which have more capabilities for electronic warfare. Aircraft carriers are still limited to very small numbers of planes, just as in the original, with the detriment that in this newer version, the planes are even more impotent in terms of being able to sink enemy ships. The original WG planes were more powerful, which partially made up for their small numbers. That is not the case with this game and it's a huge step backward.

The number of missions is increased as well, which adds to the fun."
2635,4,it works well but the buttons felt a little jammed and cluncky but only very slightly and did not effect the game.
2636,4,"I purchased this for just one game at the time. Fallout 4. Which is what this was bundled with.
I have put more than 700 hours into that game on this thing. I have bought every expansion pack for it. I love this game.
So... that made this a very expensive game. :-)

I bought into the GOLD membership on LIVE. The only value I get out of it is some of the free games you get to download monthly. A couple were games I would have never bought on my own, but were somewhat fun discoveries and enjoyable.

My son has bought a couple of games for it as well, and those were fun too.

None of that is a review of the unit, except it kind of is. What that means is that we are spending money on content for it. We already have a Xbox 360, Playstation 2, 3 and 4, as well as Nintendo Wii. So plenty of justification to not buy it and equally not play it. But we are. Not exclusively mind you. But it gets play time and we are buying games.

It is solidly built. You can't really review the software as that is a point in time view. In two weeks Microsoft might update the whole dashboard and whatever I said could be wrong later. If you are used to an older Xbox 360 dashboard / UI, then this will be a bit of a change up. But not terribly much. At this moment in time it is a fairly workable dashboard. But just like the Xbox 360, it is also Microsoft's own little advertising spam window. If you are not on a network you don't see the ads. But once you are, they fill in the edges of the screen trying to entice you to do something else than what you are actually trying to do.

The one thing I would complain about about this unit: The power button. The white glowing logo on the front of the Xbox One is the power switch. LIke a smart phone screen, you just touch the flat surface and it turns on. Touch it again and it can turn off. There is no movement or flexing of it as you press. What drives me nuts with it is that I tend to brush up against it to reach for something else and it turns on. I wish there was better sensitivity to it.

If you a buying one of these as:
- a former owner owner of an Xbox360
- finding it cheaper than the latest version of it (Xbox One S)
- getting a really great deal on it (where ever you are getting it)
Then I would say 'go for it'. Like any other game system, it is fun if you have the right games. But the same can be said about a Playstation 4.

However, if you are looking for a new gaming system and not specifically a deal, you should likely buy the S model, or wait for the next generation that is supposed to be 'coming soon'. the same can be said for the Playstation. They also have a new model with better display output (but not much more, sort of like the Xbox One S version), which you can pay a little more for than the older version.

I am pondering over which system I should buy Mass Effect: Andromeda on. I am comfortable with both controllers, and operationally they work fine with few, if any, pain points. So it is a toss up. However I think the Xbox may be the direction I go. It just feels comfortable while playing games."
2637,4,"The graphics are beautiful but I'm disappointed in that it doesn't have a open world, you pretty much go from one area to another either by fast travel or by running, so you will pretty much be fighting at all times with little break in between. Also there is not enough customizing available like in Skyrim as an example. The killing is great and very realistic but can get a little monotonous at times. All in all it's a good game but wait for the price to drop. Also make sure your PC has the horsepower to handle it so you can get those beautiful graphics to show up."
2638,4,"Have yet to hook it up, but the color of the casing is nice and grey.  Bought it to setup an gaming area in our house with an old tv we have yet to dispose of.
Post back when I give it a test run.
It did come with all of the original components and cables."
2639,4,"A lot of sub-par games have come out over the past few years.  It can take some time to sift through the bad ones until you finally find a great title worth playing.

This, my friends, is one of those great titles.

A fun, well-written, creative action/adventure game, Beyond Good & Evil is simply one of those titles that every gamer needs to own.  With an amazing stealth system, simple-yet-deep combat controls, beautiful graphics and sound (oh the sound!), and an easy-to-navigate interface, this game is nothing short of top-notch.

The only negative aspect of this game is that it's far too short.  Any seasoned gamer can finish it in anywhere from 10-15 hours.  The ending is abrupt, and since a sequel was never made, you might feel a bit stranded when you are done.

Despite that, however, this game is still worth the price tag.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fresh, original, and fun action/adventure title."
2640,4,"This seems like an unbeastable combination: Squaresoft and Disney.  For the most part, it is quite enjoyable.  Playing a since person in real time, you fight alongside Donald and Goofy.  All the Disney characters are well done, although Donald Duck is horribly weak.  (Goofy is a decent support character.)  The Summons are on the weak side, and having levels up mean only a slight increase in one or two stats is rather weak.  People play RPGs level up because they like seeing their characters get more powerful; the lack of power in your characters, especially Donald, is sad.  It takes too long to get anywhere.
Still, you can't go wrong with the atmosphere, and its nice to see Aeris and Cloud being reunited after you win the game, even if the rest of the ending is weak."
2641,4,"I understand that Full Auto isn't as deep as alot of other racing games out there, but there are 2 areas where it really shines: playing against a friend, and the Unwreck feature

Single player, even in the career mode, gets old pretty fast, but you've got lost of vehicles to choose from, maybe about 20, and you can choose different colors for each, about 12 per car, and then you can cutomize the weapons on your car to an extent. All of that adds up to some good fun if you have other people to play against. its enough variety for you to race a different car or different color or different weapons every race for weeks

The fully destructible environment adds to that too, once you get the hang of how it works. you can bring down a bridge and block the road you're racing on, you can collapse water towers, blow up npc vehicles to cause pile ups, all kinds of stuff like that. Again, not much fun in single player, but it adds to the competativeness if you're playing against friends, cause you can do alot of sneaky stuff to get ahead of them, even if you're in a slower car or are falling behind or whatever

I guess the big difference between Full Auto and most racing games is Unwreck. Basically you fill the Unwreck meter by destroying things, and then you can use that built up meter to rewind the action any time you want. If you make a wrong turn, you can rewind it. Get blown up, rewind it. Shoot at someone and miss, just rewind it and try it again. It really adds alot to the game, but you can't use Unwreck in multiplayer games, just in the single player, so keep that in mind

Anyway, I don't play Full Auto by myself, but some of my friends like it and we still play it together and have a good time whenever they're over. so if you're tired of Mario Party or whatever and need something new for your group to play, you might check it out"
2642,4,a worthy sequel but at times a bit of a pain with the some times tiring wave after wave attacks all the darn time even when they don't quiet make sense to the story
2643,4,This years game of madden is a huge step in the right direction. The gameplay has added a ton of new options on both sides of the ball give the user the ability to make adjustments and changes to match what you see in the NFL. Draft Champions game mode added a new experience to the game and if your a fan of MUT or fantasy football this mode will likely intrigue your interest as well. The gameplay & visuals has made a significant jump in progress from previous years. This year's game is the most fun I've had with Madden since 2009. This could go down as one of the best versions of the game in it's history and is a strong indicator that the current development team is moving towards simulation football.
2644,4,This is when I fail in love with music and gaming but one of the toughest games yet to date.
2645,4,"When Dice first announced the setting for this game - scratch that: when rumors started circling before the announcement that the next Battlefield would be set in WWI, I lost my mind a little bit. The setting is almost completely ignored in modern games, but ripe for adventure and heroic exploits. While I'm not a Battlefield regular, I did play Bad Company 2 and loved that campaign, and I'm fairly familiar with the multiplayer sandbox that is regular Battlefield. The final product toyed with my expectations a little bit, but more or less proved that WWI is a fine setting for a videogame.

The campaign itself is less a campaign, more a series of vignettes telling various stories, but they're great stories. Replayability is spotty, but it exists, since there are multiple achievements and medals you can earn for finding items, or using particular strategies. Overall I was a little disappointed with the total playtime of the single-player content, and feel that a bigger and better story could have been told. But it's still very enjoyable and visually stunning - and quite authentic.

The multiplayer side is a mixed bag. There are lots of ways to play within the four distinct classes, but few are very balanced. There are definitely ways to play to win, which require a lot of playtime put in to unlock better weapons, and don't encourage a lot if experimentation. Which is too bad, since the quirky weapon set is fun to unlock and use, including some of the more outlandish types of weapons I've ever seen in a realistic shooter. I wish these were easier to unlock, as you don't get much experience per time spent in game (matches are usually close to a half hour in length). The game interface and menus feel hamstrung when you don't pay for DLC. Since I have only the base game, content feels very sparse. Overall I don't approve of the way this game is set up, nor the amount of content versus what's walled away behind experience. but for such a novel setting, they could hardly have done better bringing it to life."
2646,4,"This is a good game. It has the amount of monsters that you would expect and a good amount of length.  If you are a fan of resident evil 4 then go try this game, even if this is you first time playing a resident evil game you should still go and try.  This installment is the first to include coop, split screen and online, and this is a welcome addition because it is a lot of fun to play through this with a friend. Now on to the bad.  This game moves away from the dark and horror parts that resident evil 4 had, which is a let down, but not a game killer.  Another thing is eva, you partner, who has some stupid AI so I would recommend you find a friend for when you try the harder difficulties.  Also your inventory is limited and only in real time.  Now that isn't horrible but when you are being attacked by a mob it can be hard to find the right weapon when you need it.  Even with its flaws this is still a good game for anyone, so go out and try it."
2647,4,"This is a bit out of my normal video game choice, i don't like shooters really mainly I go for strategy and puzzle type games, but there is a suspenseful aspect to this game that I have followed thru many previous versions on other consoles that I just really wanted to try it for the best graphics possible on the PS4 which I am late to the game but had just recently bought.

If you play at night lights off headphones on this will scare the heck out of you, ok it may not scare kids who play these daily but for me a casual stay at home dad who plays here and there it made me jump a few times just being honest, kinda what i wanted tho just something different and fun, challenging to me since I am not a bigtime gamer it will take me a while to finish it I am sure there are kids on youtube who crush it in 8 hours though ;)"
2648,4,"Pretty Decent for the price. Though definitely not the highest quality headset, they get the job done well. My last headset (same ones as these) worked well but the right earphone went within a year and a half. Overall i was satisfied with this purchase."
2649,4,looks great and has fun new game play mechanics
2650,4,a different take on resident evil and like how it takes place in raccoon city beacuse resident evil 2 is my all time favorite and love hunk
2651,4,"I remember back in 1996 when I owned Civilization 2 for the PC. I recall all the countless hours I spent in front of the computer playing this game. It was nothing spectacular visually or even in the sound department. It was just the concept. Owning your own civilization from the caveman days to the year 2020 is just an amazing concept. It's my favorite game!!!

Furthermore, the way game designer Sid Meier put it together was just incredible and done in a way that made the game very addicting. I had purchased his Pirates! game for the Amiga computer circa 1990 and I thought this title was somewhat superior to that one. In fact, it may have been the best game I've ever played although I do admit it might not be for everyone.

I won't go into detail about comparing this latest portable Civ title to the one on the PC I had in '96, but it does offer a solid playing experience. It was put together very well, although it lacks the good music I remember. It is also devoid of the civilization encyclopedia which kind of breaks my heart. The graphics are nothing special and the game map is in 2d. I feel as though there should have been a theme song playing that changed each time you advanced into a new era representing the era you're in. Like going from tribal drums in 4000 bc to techno music in modern day. I gather they couldn't fit all that content into one cart but I forgive them as the game plays great and much faster. It's very deep and involving. It may even be the best one I have on the DS. Why?? It's not how attractive you are, it's how much fun you are to be with. I love this game!

Footnote for Sid and 2k;

If you're reading this; I feel as though this game would be a little more suited to the PSP as you probably would be able to add those things I had mentioned being UMD's can hold more info. Also, I think the bigger screen of the PSP would help as they would allow for bigger maps and perhaps a map editor. Ironically, your other remake Pirates! would be more suited to the DS as you could have the map of the Carribean on one screen and game-play on the other. Although I'm not a big fan of the stylus game-play, I believe it would be suited more to Pirates! as you could maybe pin-point the towns you'd like to sail to or jot down extra notes in your log. These are just suggestions if you are in the process of making any re-makes or sequels of these two games. You are the best in the business! Thank you!!"
2652,4,kids try them. they like it.
2653,4,"I was excited when I saw this game online before it was released. I watched all the gameplay movies and went to wal-mart to buy it the day it was released. However, walmart didn't have it. I came back and got back online to see it again. I was extremely disappointed to see how terribly the critics had reviewed it. Still I kept my hopes up and bought it over the weekend. A horribly underrated game. I was not a fan of the original Golden Axe and I can see why some would be disappointed with this debut on next-gen consoles, but it is a traditional hack-and-slash game. Lots of blood, but that makes no difference to me. Several things the critics hit on:

Poor storyline: This is true, the storyline is lacking. Yet the developers were trying to make an arcade game next-gen and still stay true to the original. I didn't expect much for storyline.

Counter and Evade lags: Counter and evade work like Heavenly Sword where an enemy glows a certain color before attacking. Counter is a little slow, but once you realize this, it is easy to correct with proper timing.

Bad graphics: It's not the most beautiful game for PS3 (Uncharted or Heavenly Sword wins that for me), but the graphics are as horrible as the critics make it sound. I don't have an HDTV, so I'm just using composite and it looks great to me. Kinda bland with colors of the environment, but that's it.

Problems with Beasts: Yeah, they're slow and hard to turn. That was a disappointment as one expects beasts to be faster than the player's running speed. Another complaint is that the beasts die quickly. I haven't had a problem with that. It makes sense in the gameplay that the beasts shouldn't last long. If your beasts dies, just go back and respawn another one. Last thing about beasts, the critics were hard that you can get knocked off of your beast and replaced with an enemy. The solution is simple. Just jump and swing your sword in the air to knock him off. It works for me.

No Multiplayer: For fans of the original Golden Axe, I can see how this is disappointing, however the majority of games I play are single player. So I guess it's a personal preference.

In a world where most next-gen games are first-person shooters, a good hack-and-slash is hard to find. Saying that, I would recommend Devil May Cry 4 and Heavenly Sword over Golden Axe, but if you love hack-and-slash games like me, it's a worth a try."
2654,4,THis is a wonderful pedal system.  It was in great shape when I got it and works beautifully with any flight sim( I have a lot of them).  Is even great with the newest games such as Elite:Dangerous and Star Citizen both of which I use it with.
2655,4,"great game, burning the calories while playing"
2656,4,"Dark Fall: Lights Out is the second installment in the Dark Fall series. Even though the game contains elements and names in common with the other games, it is perfectly playable on its own. It also works perfectly with Windows 7 (all Dark Fall games seem to). The game itself is along the lines of ""MYST"" and ""Rhem"" and relies on challenging logic and object puzzles. Though this is definitely a ghost story at its heart, it has a wonderful plot line which makes you want to solve the puzzles, unlike many other games in the Adventure genre. And of course if you get really stuck (which I think is inevitable in any such game) there are plenty of walkthroughs and hint-sites on-line to help you out.
The story of the game is based strongly on the poem ""Ballad of the Flannen Isle"" in which a group of men discover that the keepers of the local lighthouse have vanished without a trace. The poem is extremely creepy and so is the first part of the game. Though it gets less creepy as you go, it is nevertheless a fun ghost story to follow. And this is a good one for younger gamers because there is no violence or blood and limited bad language. The lack of blood is definitely intentional because as the poem states: ""... Aye, though we hunted high and low and hunted everywhere, of those three men we found no trace, in any time or any place, but a door ajar and and untouched meal and an over-toppled chair"".
Finally, this game will also be of interest to fans of ""Doctor Who"". The classic episode titled ""The Horror of Fang Rock"" is also based on ""Ballad of the Flannan Isle"" and is referenced in sneaky ways throughout the game. The designers are not only aware of the episode but are also consummate fans of the show as in addition to references to the episode itselfm there are also references to the writer, Robert Holmes, and one of the NPCs in the game has a subscription to Doctor Who Magazine. In fact this is one of the commonalities with Dark Fall: The Journal - someone in that game also has a subscription to Doctor Who Magazine.
Overall, if you like the Adventure genre and are looking for something really fun to play, this game is definitely worth your time and money!"
2657,4,"Good kart racer. The controls are not as tight as Crash Team Racing, however this game is still a lot of fun. Crash was the biggest competition to Mario Kart, and hopefully more Crash kart racers will be made.
The story is enjoyable and has nice cutscenes. There are two separate stories depending on if you play as Team Bandicoot or Team Cortex."
2658,4,"I'm no game expert.  My son wanted this for Christmas, because a friend of his has one.  I was happier getting it as a game console than the more expensive game consoles (although I didn't see what was wrong with just using PC games), because the Nintendo games seem more oriented to kids.  On watching the kids play the included games, I'm surprised both at how simplistic they seem, and how much fun the kids have had with them.  You need to buy a separate proprietary memory card if you want to save game settings and so forth.  One thing that seems odd about this machine it that the picture seems fuzzy."
2659,4,KIDS LOVE THIS LINE OF GAMES.
2660,4,"Knack is a fun game. The storyline is on the level of a Pixar movie, the cut scene graphics as well. The game play is pretty linear and not very challenging. Each level is pretty much point A to point B with little to no exploring in between. Because of this, I do not see much replay value, which is why I have it a 4-star rating instead of 5.
The ability to play co-op is a nice feature and would be great for siblings/friends to play at the same time. You can just jump in and out of co-op by simply connect a second controller or PS Vita through remote play.
A great game for all ages and definitely worth picking up."
2661,4,No problems so far
2662,4,I was really nervous buying this because of all the reviews. Honestly it's just what I was looking for. I'm glad I took the chance. I highly recommend it.
2663,4,"Great gameplay and graphics. Everyone is talkn about the crappy driving, I agree. Each car has its own way of reacting to your moves. Most turn heavy, some easy, some drift way to quick. But once you have the timing down your good to go. Realism in driving isn't really there, but all in all i like the game. Worth owning."
2664,4,"I had to have this game. The graphics are slightly improved and the story is pretty cool, but it was definitley too short and no where near as challenging as it's predecessors. I would probably give this closer to 3 1/2 stars, but because it was part of Half-Life, which I believe is the FPS ever, I got it. Reliving some of the things that happened in the previous games was great and brought back good feelings, but it all ended too quickly. Still, the cut scenes and the story carried this one through. If the price would drop, this woudl be a no brainer."
2665,4,Good story just wish there was a lot less batmobile.
2666,4,"First off, when Gears of War came out I did not own a 360.  Once I did though this was the first game I picked up.  I'd seen the videos, I'd heard the hype, now it was time to ask the question ""does this game live up to the hype?""  If you want to skip the rest of my review, the simple answer is a resounding ""YES.""

First, lets take a look at the storyline.  Wait...there really is one there somewhere?  That's the single biggest gripe I have with the game.  They really don't flesh out the story at all.  I knew what was going on simply because I'd been online and read the ""history.""  In short, an enemy known as ""the locust"" came from underground and in one fell swoop moved the human race to the verge of extinction.  Now the humans are making one last push to survive.  Simple enough.  You are a soldier who has been imprisoned for treason and the humans bust you out and reinlist you to help fight the locust.  While the story isn't very deep at all after a few minutes of playing the game you will probably forget it.  This is the biggest reason I gave this a ""4 of 5"" overall, but in the grand scheme of things it's not terribly important...as long as you have Xbox Live gold, but we'll touch on that later.

The game is very linear so you won't spend any time wandering around wondering what to do next.  I guess it would have been nice to have it a bit more free roaming, but I still enjoyed it.  The advantage is that it's less than likely that an enemy will come up behind you.

The big new thing in this game is the cover system.  It's really simple and works pretty well.  See a stationary (and sometimes not so stationary) object and hit the A button to put your back against it.  You can see around the edges and even fire your weapons blindly.  The system works pretty well with the exception that many of the actions you can take in the game require the use of the ""A"" button.  It seems that other people have alot more problems with this than I do, 99.9% of the time it works fine.  Once or twice it's hindered me but typically it isn't a problem.

Anyways, the cover system works pretty well.  If too much of you is exposed you can still be hit, but generally if you're on level ground with an enemy he can fire away all day and won't hit you.

Graphically the game is just beautiful.  The colors are dull but I think that serves to enhance the feeling of bleakness in the game.  The human race is almost gone, what is there to be cheerful about?  The textures are very sharp and the particles and blooms look great.  This is easily the sharpest game I've seen on the 360, and one of the sharpest I've seen on any console (PC included).

The sounds are also great.  I wish the main machine gun you'll use in the game, the Lancer, had a bit more grunt to it, but overall the sounds are fantastic.  Grenades exploding next to you, bullets bouncing off your cover, it does a good job of immersing you into the game.

The weapons in the game, while I wish there were a few more, are all a good bit of fun, and all must be used a different way.  You won't find yourself rushing anyone with the Torque Bow (basically a cross bow that shoots exploding arrows).  The Lancer, probably the most used weapon in the game, serves it's purpose well: shoot from long(ish) range and if something surprises you switch to easily the coolest weapon in the game, the chainsaw bayonet.  This death dealing device will (literally) reduce your foes to spare body parts in a matter of seconds, spraying the screen with bloody bits the whole time.  It's almost shocking the first time you see it, it's just so...gross.  But at the same time it's so...fun.  I will give the nod to Epic for making this by far the most satisfying use of a chainsaw in any game I've ever played.

Finally, we come to the part of the game that you will spend the most time on, multiplayer.  And my goodness is it fun!  There are three different modes and typically I find myself playing the standard ""Warzone"" which is basically a team last man standing.  The maps cover a variety of enviromnents and all are a pleasure to play.  Also, one feature that you'll come to both love and hate is that often you won't simply kill a person, he'll fall to his knees.  At this point you've either got to hit him a time or two more to finish him off or a teammate can revive him.  The upside is that I've been saved numerous times when an enemy had to reload, the disadvantage is that my enemies can be revived.  It is a nice touch though.

One thing I find a bit annoying about the multiplayer is the game's most fun item, the chainsaw bayonet.  It is a 1 hit kill, and if they start it they WILL finish it.  If it connects you are dead no matter what.  I wish that EPIC had made a way to either escape or have it not kill you if they didn't completely finish sawing.  It is simply TOO powerful.

Overall the game is an absolute blast and I can see myself playing the multiplayer for months to come.  The game is extremely well designed and will leave you with Gears of War fever.  Does the game have flaws?  Yes, every game has a few.  But is the game great enough to overlook these flaws?  Easily!

So do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this game and get to it!  I don't think you'll be dissappointed.

*warning* This game is NOT for the young or innocent.  The game is extremely violent and the language is very rough.  If you are mature enough to handle that though then nab it!"
2667,4,"Upon playing Mass Effect 1, you felt as though there was no way to top the epic, cinema-style experience it brought to the world. I mean, we FINALLY had a game worthy of the modern day and age, where as so many game makers fail to bring something modern and epic, to the table. Mass Effect 1 was nearly perfect. Mass Effect 2 is not so much. I can't say it's really ""worse"" but it is, however, different. Very different.

If you haven't heard by now, the story of ME2 is Commander Shepard dying after an attack on the Normandy following the Battle of the Citadel. Terrorist organization Cerebus spends billions of dollars reviving Shepard and building a new Normandy, and you, as Commander Shepard, go on a quest to find the most powerful guns-for-hire on a mission to find out what's happening to human settlements across the galaxy to make them vanish in thin air. The Alliance and the Council has forgotten your deeds to save the galaxy and all your old friends have moved on, in your absence. Cerebus, despite them being more or less ""the bad guys,"" are all you've got left and considering they brought you back to life, they're all you know now.

Essentially, the whole gaming experience is like GOING FROM RICH TO POOR. Instead of just cruising through, you now have to earn your way in EVERYTHING in this game. Kind of an easy way to put it is that the game is much harder. Only, it's not necessarily ""harder"" as much as it's a lot more work, and you're given a lot less.

Those who felt as though they mastered Mass Effect 1, played through on Insanity level and never once died... well, those days are over. All your expertise, skills, knowledge, and yes, even cash, is gone. Mass Effect 2 takes place in the lawless and poverty stricken Terminus systems. Whereas Mass Effect 1 had a ""Citadel"" and ""Presidium"" feel to it (you're given everything and know what you have to do), the sequel definitely has a ""Terminus systems"" feel to it. The game is darker, more violent, more ""evil"" if you will, and you won't be getting any help from the Alliance or the Council. While you're not ""on your own,"" you definitely are against the world in this. Working for the pseudo-terrorist organization, Cerebus, who players of One came across in the Traverse, you soon find your own pleasures and leisures gone, and you must make do with very little. This is reflected in the actual game, in the literal sense, and in the gameplay.

Remember how I said, those who beat One on Insanity level and had earned the right to be cocky would no longer be able to be so? Well, this is true because the entire gameplay is overhauled and redone. Mostly inspired by ""Call of Duty"" but in a Third-Person shooter way, you'll have to be extremely careful in gunfights, as survival is number one. No more ""Scarface"" style, video-game-esque walking out into open space and Assault Rifle'ing everyone and anything that stands in your way. Taking cover is absolutely essential in this game. You try to Machine Gun an entire gang of enemies in the open and you WILL be massacred! There is no more health to use in ME2, and it is now all auto-regenerated, like in Call of Duty. When I first heard this, I was really upset and thought you'd waste hours in gunfights, waiting for your health to boost back up before shooting again. However, they somehow pull it off perfectly, here in ME2. Mainly it's because your health and shields boosts back up really quickly, no matter how hurt you are. Like, in two or three seconds. There's no long waits to recover, like I thought. Your shields are also pretty good at absorbing damage. One full-on rocket or grenade blast is what it'll take to fully shatter them in one blow. In ME1, this would normally insta-kill you. Even though the new system suprisingly doesn't make you miss Medi-Gel (it still exists in the game, but is only used to activate the Unity team recovery power), you still need to take cover as multiple hits from enemies shatter through your shields, and then health, pretty quickly. Cover is essential for survival. And unlike the ""wall-stick"" of One, this time, you can hold A to cover behind walls and boxes. The game is designed so that everything can be used to cover behind and that you'll almost always have a 'safe' place to hide. Also, you're given far FAR less powers and abilities. While the Soldier class can still use every gun in the game, the hybrid classes suffer a lot. There's about less than half the powers you used to be available to have. Partly, this is due to the new gameplay style, but a lot of it is just designed to give you a far tougher experience. And as you might know by now, the unlimited ammo guns are all gone. Now, you have to use ammo and conserve it, wisely. And specialized ammo is now a privilege, not a given. You have to upgrade your squad abilities to use such ammo as Incendiary and Disruptor (Proton, in ME1) ammo.

So, with less powers, ammunition-required firearms, cover being mandatory to survive, special ammo being something you have to earn, and harder enemies to boot, you have a lot harder experience on your hands and are no longer given ""unlimited range"" to do whatever you want. It's kind of a positive and negative. You have a new gaming experience, but one where you're dealing with the bare minimum instead of having a wide range of powers and guns at your disposal. One good bonus is now, instead of a myriad of the same gun made by different manufacturers, all of your guns are now varied and unique. This means playing as an Adept, who is only limited to using pistols, isn't so bad anymore as you now get different pistols, such as a standard pistol, hand cannon, automatic pistol, and so on. This makes the gun restrictions of classes a lot MORE useful. Oh, and everyone gets the same Armor. (I'd guess it's an Onyx medium, comparing to ME1) But you get to customize your armor, however you want, choosing colors, patterns, and designs for it.

The ""poor man's experience"" doesn't just stop with gunfights. Although you can import your Mass Effect 1 character and storyline actions into the game, you can't import any of their weapons, ammo, credits, or squad powers. Even if you've done three playthroughs with one character to get them to that almighty Level 60, you'll be starting from scratch again in the sequel. Squad powers are different now, and you only have four or five squad abilities now, instead of 15+. Leveling up powers will be done 1, 2, 3, or 4 points at a time, instead of one-by-one. And as I said, some things will be for what you used to have at any given time in One, like ammo. Yes, you have to level up just to use certain types of ammo. (And no, they aren't more powerful or that much different than they were in One.) When exploring the uncharted Terminus systems, you'll have to mine for resources. Where as in ME1, you got a planets' elements with the press of a button, this time, you'll need to spend money on probes and actually need to scan an ENTIRE PLANET to find elements. I'm guessing The Alliance had a division for that. You, do not. The Iridium, Platinum, and Palladium you find will be needed to upgrade weapons. No longer do you just find or buy upgrades. They have to be made, and require these elements. And you have to find them, yourself. It's like going from having an unlimited credit card, to finding pennies on the street. The ""good news"" I guess, is that doing it this way means gaining a lot more material from a planet than before. It is also an odd mix of interesting and EXTREMELY boring, at the same time. You know you need to mine that planet until it's utterly depleted, so you keep going, but anyone watching you do this will be bored to sleep. There also are no more Mako missions, where you drop down to planets and explore, either. Many people will be disappointed by this, by many other people who felt it tedious and boring, will be thrilled.

Your new characters all have different personalities, and allows the player to definitely pick and choose their favorites. While I may hate Jack's juvenile attitude, to many other people, she may be a favorite. While Mordin may be a hyperactive William Shatner to some, to others, he may be downright annoying. This helps to definitely give you a unique gaming experience. But in my personal opinion, ten characters may be too much, even if it is only four more than before. In this game, you'll have to do ""loyality"" missions, similiar to the Dr. Saleon mission you did for Garrus in ME1, or the Family Armor one you did for Wrex. These missions do two things. One, they help determine how much, if at all, your character trusts you. And two, they help build them up for the big and final ""suicide"" mission you go on at the end of the game. These missions help determine just how useful they are in battle when there's more focus on them over your other ally. You may find out someone isn't all that good. Or vise versa, and that they're better than you thought them to be.

The imports from Mass Effect 1 don't have nearly as much of an impact as one would think. Although the facial import is pretty darn impressive (they look exactly the same in One, aside from a few new scars), everything else is described in the beginning when you export them. The only major imports aside from your Shepard are who died on Virmire, if the Council survived, and who was appointed onto the council following the Battle of the Citadel. And while you can change combat classes, no matter what you were before, I disliked how they didn't let you *edit* your imported character's physical appearance in ME2. My female Shepard always had too high cheekbones that I didn't notice until I started playing One and I was hoping to fix that when I imported her into ME2. When I ended Mass Effect 1, I had a male Paragon Soldier who saved the Council, spared people's lives no matter what, and appointed Anderson as the fourth member of the Council. And a female Renegade Adept who left the Council to die, didn't choose anyone to replace the dead Council, and was only nice to her fellow teammates and no one else. Upon importing both Marvin and Kristen into ME2, the only noticable differences I seen right away was the love interest who helped my Shepard save the original Normandy crew when it was being attacked, and when I traveled to the Citadel to see who's in charge. (By the way, you can't really travel to the Presidium on the Citadel, anymore. Instead, you go to a tacky, working class part of the Citadel called the Zakera Ward and it's really lame.) Maybe as I play along, I'll find more differences, but the sad reality of it seems to be that all those minor (and major) choices from ME1 don't really matter, anymore. I don't even think it matters if anyone survived the first game or not. You could've hypothetically had everyone but Garrus and Tali die in One, and it wouldn't matter at all in Two.

Being a Paragon or Renegade has much less of an effect in the game. While the dialogue options are still there, based on your morality, the actual changes done to the entire game are minimal. They effect how, or if, your scars will heal. But beside that, the choices are just for fun, only. One new feature lets you ""change the cutscene"" by performing a quick-action, on-queue Paragon or Renegade action while a character is talking to create a new path for the conversation. (Doing these will mean missing the usually good dialogue, though.) Ultimately, the choices don't really matter, anymore. One problem I had with the Renegade path in ME1 is that even while performing Renegade actions, your character still felt ""too good."" There wasn't enough killing people in cold-blood or being borderline evil, just for the sake of it. And in the choices, you felt more like you had to be a Paragon, not because the Renegade options were bad, but because being a Renegade just meant being a pr*ck, more than anything else. Renegade aren't ""evil"" actions; they're just assh*le actions, instead. And there's even less of a feel of being tough and ruthless here, rather than just being a do*che. So even my supposedly-Renegade female Shepard still ended up being about 40% Paragon just because of how big of a jerk Renegade Shepard is.

Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a brand new adventure, with some elements of the past behind it. In some regards, it's actually better played if you've never played the first game, before. You certainly have a lot to get used to in the sequel and experts and veterans on One will have to start all over again in learning how to play, even if exporting their seasoned character from the first game. While it is interesting and worth it's sixty dollar price, in terms of depth, scope, and replay value, in many ways, it's not as ""good"" as the first game. It's a much tougher experience from the original and takes doing a lot of side work in order to succeed. With that said, I don't know how many new players of the series may like the game. Those expecting non-stop action may become bored, fast. Those unused to third-person shooters like this may find the game much too difficult. And a select few who casually played the original may hate the new changes and sacrifices the sequel puts you through. Ultimately, the vast majority of players to this game will be those who played and enjoyed Mass Effect, the original. I guess it's good so many players enjoyed ME1, then. While it definitely feels like they've worked and expanded on a lot in ME2, it just isn't as much... fun. No, it's not nearly as fun, this time around. The game is just more depressing and involves a lot more side work, which sometimes comes off as a tedious chore. Mass Effect 2 also has quite a few noticeable glitches in it, too. Sloppy looking work. In One, the only real glitch was the High Explosive Ammo force that often sent enemies behind walls or into floors. In 2, there are sometimes object glitches, as well as menu glitches, like not letting you go back to something with B.

To sum it all up, Mass Effect 2 is fine enough for fans of the original, despite all its changes, but may not be worth it for those foreign to the series. While ME1 was almost universally liked and praised for its innovation, exploration, and fun, Mass Effect 2 is just a lot more depressing, requires a lot more work, and is a lot more difficult. That's fine if you're looking forward to continuing your Shepard into the lawless Terminus systems. But for everyone else, it's a bit of a ""chore video game"".

*** Some post-game negatives I thought I should add onto here ***

Your partner AI is really dumb. While more helpful than the first game, they almost ALWAYS run right out into danger, with no cover or anything. Unless you don't care about them, you'll often find yourself using Unity to revive them because they foolishly keep rushing out into open fire and you have to direct them to safe spots to keep them from consistently getting killed. They also love to hop over cover objects a lot, for some reason.

The Machine Pistol (the first one you get) is just the worst weapon ever. Now, re-playing the game as my female Renegade Adept, I have to say using that machine pistol is just dreadful. I loathe it to a T. I'd rather waste Heavy Weapon ammo on weaklings than to be forced to use that stupid pistol. It's too bad the regular Heavy Pistol has low ammo clips, because I just dread using that Godawful machine pistol so, so much. It's weak, it's slow, and it's VERY inaccurate! Even the Battle Rifle and Hand Cannon are better weapons and they're terrible, too! The second, upgraded machine pistol is slightly better, but still...

The first Mass Effect did not have the dialogue problem the second has. Repeating, looping dialogue! When you're on the Citadel's Zakera Ward, you hear the same three lines of conversation with civilians over and over and OVER! The first game had it play once and then, that was it! Unless, you talked to them to get them to repeat what they said. Also, the slanderous reporter lady still hangs around there AFTER talking to (or punching) her. Uh... that shouldn't be the case. They really dropped the ball with NPC interaction in this game. The looping dialogues and characters standing around all useless, doesn't look good.

And perhaps the biggest flaw... WHY do you need two discs for a game that's literally half as much as the first game? When Shepard can only get to Level 30 and there are only, at the most, nine or ten side missions to find and discover while scanning planets, why do we even need two discs? It feels so cheap. Half the game with twice as many discs. How does that happen?

Again, I feel it's important I note these flaws in the game. Hopefully, looking back on this when Mass Effect 3 comes out, I hope we will be able to see Mass Effect 2 as an entertaining game, but ultimately and undenibaly the weakest link out of the three. It's still a fun game, but I'm not sure it's worth sixty dollars, especially since it's literally half the game Mass Effect 1 was. I say, wait until the price drops under thirty dollars before buying this game. It's still fun and worth playing at least twice. It's just not ""sixty dollars"" fun."
2668,4,The Xbox has a long way to go on this console. I think it can get there eventually but the GUI and system menus needs to be redone. No one likes Windows 8 and Microsoft needs to accept that. There are way too many bugs still going on with this system for me to rate this any higher than 4 stars.
2669,4,"The only other winter  sports game I've ever played was SSX3, which was ok.  It's was marginally enjoyable, but I didn't spend much time with it.

So, I was glad to be able to try this game.  For the most part it's great.  For starters, it's a gorgeous looking game.  The graphics are really, really superb.  The mountains, snow, sky are just great.

There's a pretty wide variety of sports - parachuting, wingsuits, snowboarding.  It's a bit trick to remember all the combos to pull of tricks, but it's very fun all the same.  There's a career mode, challenges and multi-player (I haven't tried MP yet).

Finally, the announcer of a sports game isn't some ""dude-bro"" who speaks in cliches and raspy voices with plenty of ""whoas!""  The announcer in Steep is a rational, sane person.  That's a nice change.

The only drawback to this game is that you always have be on-line.  I don't understand why developers do this.  I assume its for data mining.  If that's the case, then that gives me pause.

All in all, very fun and recommended."
2670,4,"The Curse of Monkey Island was a fun-filled adventure that will keep you wanting more.  It is very exciting, although the story is not as good as the first two games.  Its animation is top notch and the sound is pretty good.  I did have some problems with the sound every now and then.  The characters would stutter and blip.  Good game that is very good value for the money you pay.  Buy it today!!"
2671,4,I just purchased this game even though the new one is coming out next month more than likely. Not a bad game at all. I like it!
2672,4,"I would actually give this title 4.5 stars out of 5.  Every PSP owner should know what Lumines is and the Vita version is a nice representation.  The music is great, the graphics (although not really complex) have been nicely updated, and it can keep me entertained for hours on end.  To me, Lumines essentially represents what Tetris was for the Gameboy back in the early 90's.  There are some new elements in this version of Lumines.  Q Entertainment has introduced touch controls, a new shuffle block that will rearrange already placed blocks, high score sharing, and they took out picture puzzle mode.  Some of these changes are nice, others aren't that big of a deal, and one won't be used.  The shuffle block has turned into a lifesaver for me especially when I have a display full of single blocks that aren't lining up.  It rearranged them and creates multiple 4X4 (and even 4X6) combos that help clear things out.  I didn't like this at first but I really enjoy it now especially since it lets me play the game longer in marathon mode.  The high score sharing is also nice, that will be the first thing you see when Lumines is started as you will see where you stand with all of your friends.

The lack of the picture puzzle mode isn't a big deal for me as I never really cared for it on the previous PSP version.  It was fun to try once every blue moon but definitely not a game seller.  I have two issues with this game and the touch controls are one of them.  They feel slapped on and I definitely can't use them as the pace starts picking up.  New players may enjoy them but previous Lumines fans will likely be sticking to the d-pad and buttons as they work faster anyway.  So that is a new element that I did not enjoy but it is there.  My second problem with this game is that I experience framerate drops every once in a while (about 2-3 times when I play marathon mode for about 30-45 minutes).  This normally wouldn't be a problem but it has occurred right when I was trying to place a block so I would wind up putting it in the wrong spot.  I understand that the Vita is a new system and Q Entertainment is probably going to release a patch to fix this.  Still, it is a pain that deters gameplay and takes away from a stellar title.

All-in-all, I still think this is a must own for Vita gamers.  It expands upon the original PSP releases while offering upgraded graphics and levels.  It is still Lumines at its core and is enticing for new Sony handled gamers.  Without a question, every Vita owner should buy this game the day they pickup their console."
2673,4,"I just bought this game a couple days ago.  I like the graphics on it.  The game play reminds me of the Donkey Kong game that was released on Game Boy back in 1994.  It starts out easy, but gets more difficult as you get further into the game.  I am on level four now, and the screen that I am on is very difficult.  You have to grab the key and hit direction switches to make the belts go the other way, and you have to hit red and yellow switches to change the blocks into solid ones.  I have tried everything to get through that level, and I am quite frustrated right now.  If there was a player's guide for this game, it would really help me out a real lot.  I can maybe get some pointers on how to beat each level.  Overall, this game is fun and difficult at the same time."
2674,4,"I honestly always forget to charge it, but that's my fault. Saves me some battery money!"
2675,4,"Fire Emblem: Awakening is a excellent introduction to the tactical rpg genre, even allowing a Casual Mode that allows your units to retreat from the battlefield when they reach 0 health, where they would normally perish for good. This mode is good for people who have never played a Fire Emblem game before and it eases them into the mechanics of the game without punishing them too harshly for their mistakes. However, FE:A is significantly easier than other titles in the Fire Emblem series, and if you want to steamroll everything, you can use an item that allows to fight a group of enemies anywhere you'd like for easy experience. Still, an enjoyable experience."
2676,4,"I was actually surprised by PURE. Recent racing games haven't been my cup of tea over the last few years because it seems as if every developer adds a bunch of unnecessary layers (endless tweaking, passing tests to get to the meat of the game, etc.) that makes jumping in and really enjoying the game as it's meant to be enjoyed a practice in tedium from the get-go. That's NOT the case with PURE. Sure, there's plenty to tweak your ATV with, but by-in-large, PURE is an old-school ARCADE racer through and through, and that's most definitely a good thing.

First of all, the game is endlessly pretty. The animations are great, the textures are as detailed as you'd like, the character models, lighting, etc., but you don't play a game just for the eye-candy. The game is simple and straight-forward arcade racing, but there is some technique to it. While PURE is like any other racing game out there in that the first to the finish line wins, the only way to really win is to take advantage of turbo boosts, and the only way to attain those is to perform TRICKS & STUNTS. While a lot of off-road/motorcycle/EXTREME racing games allow you to do tricks for bonuses, in PURE, it's basically a necessity. If you don't do them, you don't get boosts, and without those, you won't win. In doing this, PURE basically manages to make what's usually a gimmick in the genre vital to the gameplay. As you progress, you get flashier tricks, which in turn give you bigger turbo boosts. This might actually make the game sound a little intimidating, but PURE gives you plenty of tutorials, practice runs and control schemes to make sure that you'll find something that works for you.

Another great aspect of PURE are the tracks. With over 30 tracks in the game, with tons of variety in their topography and features (jungles, deserts, mountain paths, you name it). These are huge tracks with tons of jumps, obstacles and alternate paths and shortcuts to take (and you'll want to find everyone).

Overall, Disney Interactive did a much better job with PURE than I ever dreamed they would. It's fun from the start, drives fast to the end and offers enough in the way of variety and technique to challenge and entertain just about any gamer. If you like games like SSX, WaveRace, HydroThunder or Excitetruck, add PURE to you library."
2677,4,"This one i consider to be a mild improvement over the first in the series and all the better that it is portable. Again these get a little repetitive, but they are great games especially on the Vita."
2678,4,it is all the hype said it would be!  My only complaint is that the mapping system doesn't work very well but other than that it is pretty decent!  Especially when you have a surround sound system it really utilizes it wonderfully!
2679,4,"It worked fine while I had it. It's been a while since I bought this and I don't even have an Xbox 360 anymore, but having the rechargable batteries was very handy. My only problems were keeping up with them and getting my kids to actually charge them. They would die and instead of charging them, would just put the old packs on and then lose the rechargeable ones. I think that's ultimately happened to them anyway, they just got lost."
2680,4,"There have only been a couple of matrix games made ENTER THE MATRIX which was mediocore and THE MATRIX ONLINE which has not proven to be something all that great. But with the Path of Neo there is success. PLaying as neo is truly awsome the amount of pain you dish out is awsome and the moves you pull off will leave you in awe.

 The game has a lot going for it mainly you play as neo. There are lots of moves to learn and the melee weapons are fun to use and there are lots of asses to be kicked. THe game goes through all three movies adding on stuff so you have more to play the story is the same as before with several minor changes so as to give you more playing time. The graphics are so so sometimes they look great and sometimes they look like crap no major complaints there.

 One of the best things about the game is some of the levels. These levels are basically taken from the movies and really capture the essence of the matrix and playing them is a hella fun. The big shootout near the end of the first matrix is made perfectly in the game and the awsome smith fight is done extremely well beating the hell outa hundreds of smith was truly sweet. But some of the levels are lackluster and were just thrown in so as to not have a really short game and still the game is not that long maybe twelve hours at the most. It is a fun experiance but fifty bucks isn't gonna cut for me. The path of neo is the best matrix game out there but there isn't enough in the package to justify shelling out fifty dollars."
2681,4,"The game's general story is: seemingly nobody boy wants to leave planet to explore, is mistaken for someone else, and has to keep up this facade to prevent himself from missing out on his chance to explore the galaxy.

And the game starts off good, really good. The problem is just that as the game continues the story becomes more and more predictable and sappy. I think there was one plot twist but you could see it coming a mile away (heck there were cutscenes in every location directly telling you it would happen).

That said, the combat system is fun, it's a mix between Secret of Mana's action based battling and Final Fantasy's random battles which may or may not turn off people to the game. I found it to be refreshing and, for the most part, enjoyed the battles. I did find, however, toward the end, you could rely on casting one skill at the beginning of each battle and pretty much kill all the enemies in one quick blow, time and time again.

There are plenty of side things to do ranging from a bug arena (pretty interesting idea) where you bring collected bugs to battle to be the best to a factory where you arrange materials collected with set recipes to build new items for the stores you frequent.

Unfortunately, the game's story is horrid and there are other flaws which take this almost wonderful game and turn it into something less than exciting. One of the main flaws with the game, I'd say, is the constant need to grind away at enemies to survive at all. You'll beat one area and instantly be thrown into the next where the enemies seem nearly impossible. I mean, it makes sense to increase the level of the enemies but so dramatically? It just forces you to sit at the beginning of each stage, build up enough of a level to survive the battles, and then move on out.

There are also weird items you get in your inventory that seem to have no purpose after their initial use and are downright silly. You're given a glove that increases your strength at one point to break something in your way... but then the glove is never used again. Oh wow, we're very lucky that glove was in the area for this predicament.

Anyhow, the game is pretty and if you can stand the somewhat sappy empty story you will enjoy the game. So if you do see it on sale, I suggest buying it and giving it a try. Don't jump into it thinking it'll be on the level of any other RPG series (Suikoden, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy) because it just isn't."
2682,4,"The game looks great on wii u.  You have three options to play the game.  First with the gamepad which gives you access to your weapons and gadgets on the touch screen which is very handy.  Second method play on gamepad without tv.  Which is a nice feature most wii u titles have.  Last is using a pro controller which I love that controller's design much better then the xbox one where one stick is up high and under is down low.

The story is well voice acted by the characters.  I love taking my time and going full spy and covert on missions.  Using gadgets to distract enemies.  I also love playing co op with friends too."
2683,4,Great Product!
2684,4,"Ive already given an in depth review of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on Amazon.com back within 2011-2012. At the time, I did praise it as one of the best open world RPGS of the last generation where I currently have almost 250 hours of playtime on the PC version via steam. Now nearing the end of 2016, Bethesda releases yet another version of the beloved game titled Special Edition for the current generation of gaming platforms. The big question for this version is it really that special, and most importantly, is it worth the AAA price of admission again? To answer that adequately, it all depends entirely on the platform: PC or console (PS4 or XboxOne) and if you played it before or not. This review is based around a PlayStation 4 copy (or console version in general), and the preloaded PC version.

Starting with consoles:
If you were one of the many who struggled with an old PlayStation 3 copy, good news then! Skyrim finally works and it looks SO much better than it ever has on consoles. When you exit the tutorial area, you will immediately see the difference the Special Edition offers from the previous version. Loading screens are actually near the PC version and none so far for me took more than a minute to finish. I have not experienced any drastic frame rate drops due to consecutive hours of playing or NPC /environment loading. What is introduced are the new graphical features like the volumetric lighting (god rays) and in depth occlusion that was in Fallout 4. Outside areas have more foliage with numerous plant detail variety making areas you previously seen look more lush and lifelike. The draw distance has been improved showcasing details the previous-gen versions could never achieve before. Weather effects have received an overhaul as well with improvements to rain, snow, or fog. Even viewing Bleakfalls Barrow for the uptenth time felt awe stirring as before, with the new snowy fog and cloud details surrounding it. It's basically all of those old ENB improvement mods that the PC got to make things looks better or realistic, its here in the SE.  The different character save system from FO4 is also here as well. Im sure there are tons of added improvements from FO4 graphical or technical to mention, but Im not going into more detail for the moment. However, the big bad news for the console versions of the SE is that its still locked at 30 FPS. This is really unfortunate for 5 year old game even though its open world in my opinion. While Im sure there are technical reasons due to the PS4 and XB1 hardware limitations, I figured this was going to be the one thing Bethesda was going to accomplish for the SE. Also, there have been no real effort to buff up character and NPC textures either. Ideally how characters animate and look from the previous version is the same here. In fact, there are still some environment textures, for example inside areas that still showcase the age of Skyrim itself and Bethesdas aging game engine. Mods are finally available for consoles now.but if you own the SE for PS4you really get shafted a numerical amount compared to the XB1 version. Blame Sony for that one. However, it is easy to load what is available and for the most part mods have worked adequately. A weird issue is occuring for several players with thier widescreen displays too. Words are cut off from the far edges while in menus. Depending on your TV, it's an easy fix, but I found it annoying that I can't change the aspect boundaries like you can with most PS4 games....or not have this issue at all where other remastered games are working as intended at their 1080p resolutions. Hopefully this will be patch soon.

PC:
The good news is if you already purchased the previous version of Skyrim with all of its available DLC, you get a free copy of the Special Edition from Steam. Also included is the th SE version is finally loaded as 64 bit so there can now be more mods loaded, and at least 4gb of ram used for performance sake. While nothing has changed the core game mechanics or experience, the SE version is separate for some reason in your Steam library. I think Bethesda thought this was the easiest way to release it when ideally it should just have been an upgrade patch for PC. They also probably didn't want interfere with the numerous mods available from the Steam workshop and SkyrimNexus. The SEs mod support and layout is identical to FO4s with Bethesda hosting them. Its still optional unlike the console versions, but unfortunately, no Steam Workshop as far as I can tell. Be careful of which character save files you use with the SE. If you previously modded one, there could be load issues. To me, the PC version feels like port from consoles even though its the SE. I believe Bethesda worked on the PS4 version first to make amends to the many angry PS3 owners of the past. Ive even read a strange report that the audio quality of both the PC and XB1 versions is somehow worse than PS4. It wouldnt still be a Bethesda title if weird glitches still existed from the previous PC version. Even though its native 1080P with default 60 FPS, weird glitches can still occur. I advise not to unlock your framerate for the introduction sequenceunless you want to watch horses do crazy things.

Conclusion:
This is a hard title to rate as a whole since it depends entirely on the platform and the person playing the Special Edition. If you have already poured hours into Skyrim back then, then its most likely not worth looking into. If you already own or don't own the original PC version, then the SE really isn't since you can mod it to look and perform better than its current state. If you absolutely loved the game and wanted to play it again, but felt cheated by the awful port from a previous gen version, then this could be worth the full price. In hindsight for some PC players (like me), the Special Edition IS THAT version you modded towards to begin with. Instead of browsing third party websites and copying over data files, its technically already here.  In my opinion, Bethesda did an amazing job with Skyrims environment detail that if I wanted to add mods, I can only make it better. Who knows, I might easily pour another 100+ hours into a new character in the SE.
But the ultimate factor for the SE that one has to consider is new players. If you are absolutely new to Skyrim or the Elder Scrolls series in general, is the Special Edition worth buying right now? For Consoles, absolutely! While the story and graphical details are nowhere near the levels of Dragon Age: Inquisition or the Witcher 3, Skyrim is still a fantastic experience no matter the price you pay. Ideally, Bethesda should not have asked for $59.99 upfront for a 5 year old game. It feels greedy on their part, Ill definitely agree. But when you think of the hours upon hours of content one could pour into Skyrim (including the DLC), that pretty much justifies the price in my opinion. I envy anybody who are starting completely fresh with Skyrim. I wish I could turn off that section of my brain and think its 2011 all over again. Skyrim is still one of my favorite RPGS and arguably the best entry in the Elder Scrolls series. Man, after typing all of this, I want go play it on my PC, or watch my daughter play it on our PS4."
2685,4,I love this game had hours and hours of fun . I like taking pictures and making the statues but my kids didn't bother doing much of that . I have done the game severel times . Zelda game are my favorite . Some part were hard and I gave up but then I came back try again and got it so don't gave up to soon .
2686,4,"Ive played several paper marios. These along with the mario and luigi series are my favorite games.

While being a paper mario game, it is fun. However I find the game lacking when compared to others in the series.

There is very little story involved, this is one of the reasons why I love the series for the wacky story lines. This game more or less just has the story arc of new super mario bros wii.

Fights are by and large useless. Im about half way done with the game, and I find that when I can I tend to just shuffle around to not fight enemies as there is no incentive to do so, infact fighting only loses you stickers.

This game is fun, and I would reccomend it. But only to the people who truly love the paper mario series, however expect it to be the worst of the series."

2688,4,"Civilization Revolution was what finally convinced me to buy a DS.  Nintendo already had a better reputation for strategy games than the other portable of the era, and this title clinched the advantage.

Though accelerated (a couple hours per game instead of 40 hours) and simplified (less micromanagement), Civ Rev still feels rich and enjoyable.  There's still plenty of room to plot a variety of paths to victory and pursue them in any number of ways.  It's a smaller sandbox than desktop Civilization/Alpha Centauri, but you can do a lot inside of it.  You can focus on defense, hunker down with great people and block your opponents victory paths with espionage.  You can dominate the world with tanks, artillery and even nuke your enemies.  There are fantastic exploration bonuses that encourage you to explore each new world as early as possible.

I've read the difficulty varies from port to port, for example, the iOS version is less difficult.  On the DS version, the AI actually cheats in Deity difficulty mode, big time, and that's a good thing.  I'd much rather have a cheating AI that can actually challenge me than no challenge at all.  One of the clues that it cheats is if you leave an enemy galley from the earliest era alone, it will continue unloading units of increasing tech until the end of the game without moving to reload.  It's first unit will be a warrior and its last will be artillery.  There are also instances in which civs which don't have the special projects (because you or another civ does have them)or other means to achieve rapid economic, scientific or cultural advancement will (apparently) get extra multipliers towards one of those ends.  This is a far more effective cheat for the AI than the bottomless galleys.  You have to really scramble to prevent these surprise bonuses from winning a quick victory.  Even once you're really good at the game, this mechanism can keep things interesting.

There's plenty of room for Sid to improve this fork of the series, so I do hope sequels find their way to market, but it's a great game, even after all this time."

2690,4,"I simply love this game.  Corvo is blamed for a crime he didn't commit.  The little girl who is clearly his daughter (no spoiler there) is kidnapped and he wants revenge.  Boy does he get it.  20+ hours of beautiful scenery and such immaculate sneaking and fighting mechanics that it's almost too good.  My only complaint is that it could've been longer.  I've found myself playing this games for all the possible outcomes and it's so lovely.  If you don't have it, then get it.  It's worth it."
2691,4,"I bought the download for this game on my ps4 for 18 bucks and I was worried at first after I read mostly negative reviews.  First off let me say that if you are buying this game and expecting an MLB The Show type gaming experience you are a moron!  You should know this before buying it.  I am a baseball junkie and i was also a big fan of the RBI baseball series growing up as a kid on my nes and genesis.  While I already own and love MLB The Show 15 already,  I wanted another baseball option to add to my library and for about 20 bucks I gave RBI 16 a shot.  At first it seemed a lil difficult playing against the computer but after adjusting the difficulty to 'easy' and playing 3-4 games in a row, I got the hang of it and playing became more simple!  When batting just like in real baseball you have to hit the ball on the sweet part of the bat if you want it to go far so once you figure out where the computer will probably throw the next pitch you can move your batter to stand in the right spot for a sure hit and/or homerun!  As far as pitching you have a fastball and an offspeed pitch.  All you have to do is paint the corners inside and outside and you can fool the computer fairly easily and rack up strikeouts.  Most games I hit multiple homeruns and usually score 7+ runs a game against the computer.  You can play a shortened season or a full 162 game season and you can simulate games you don't feel like playing.  It keeps track of your player's stats for you baseball stat geeks as the season moves along.  The stadiums all look correct for each city.  For the money I spent I actually enjoy this game!!  It's an enjoyable arcade baseball game and fun to play when you just wanna play a quick baseball game!

 This is not meant to be a super realistic game,  it is meant to be an arcade style baseball game with simple controls and gameplay."
2692,4,"The Good: Amazing visual feat, gun play transitions well from the PS3, fun multiplayer, brutal melee kills, the Valor system and drones are awesome

The Bad: Short campaign, story is lacking, small multiplayer suite, lacks the epicness of the PS3 games, campaign feels very linear and claustrophobic

The PS Vita has been really struggling with great games lately and with the dual analog sticks everyone has been chomping at the bit for a good FPS. Resistance: Burning Skies was decent, but nowhere near the quality of the console games. Along came Black Ops II which could have been an amazing experience, but instead was a literally unfinished game and has been deemed the worst Vita game ever made. Now that Killzone has come along we finally have the great portable FPS experience we have all been wanting. While it's not exactly up to par with the PS3 Killzone games, it's still a great game.

Killzone has never been famous for its story, but the whole universe of Killzone is interesting itself. You play a mercenary working for both the ISA and Helghast -- you basically want the war to go on longer for more money. The story picks up right after Killzone 3, but this isn't a direct sequel to the events between the warring nations. The game also plays a little differently from other Killzone games. It feels a bit faster, yet still has the heavy feeling weapons and gun play fans have grown to love. The game is definitely optimized for portable play and for the Vita. You switch weapons with the touch screen (one secondary and primary) as well as using grenades and your drone. The controls are actually cleverly laid out utilizing the entire system without compromising comfort.

Weapons aren't picked up via enemies this time around -- you get access to a black market where you buy them and equip them. You earn cash by picking up ammo, stealth kills, melee kills, multiple kills, or any other way you can think of. This is a brand new feature to the series and it works well. The only thing about the weapons that I was disappointed about was that they are the same ones we've seen through the entire series and there aren't that many of them. Even so, the campaign levels are very linear and mostly in enclosed areas so you will stick with a shotgun and a sub-machine gun most of the time. Speaking of the campaign, there are only 9 short levels. While they are fun, they aren't anything special and lack the epic set pieces of the console games. However, most people are going to pick this game up for the multiplayer suite.

Mercenary has a brand new Valor system that uses decks of cards. You rank up and earn new cards by doing things in the game -- most will be earned in multiplayer. This is to extend the longevity of the game and to keep you coming back. The online play is a bit more fast paced than the PS3 games and is a lot of fun. This is really feels like a console game in your hands. It's so satisfying to sneak up behind someone and execute a brutal melee kill or start getting a kill streak going. Be warned -- there is a lack of modes and maps here. I hope more are introduced through DLC, but what's here is fun for quick bursts of online shooting action. Another new system introduced are drones. These are weapons that can launch missiles down on enemies, put up shields, make you invisible, or even be used as a mobile auto-turret. This adds a whole new level to the series and is a lot of fun.

The graphics in Mercenary are phenomenal. The best portable graphics to ever grace a handheld device. They look nearly as good as the PS3 games. There is so much detail everywhere it's nearly impossible to imagine how the Vita can render this or have this much power. Thankfully the frame rate keeps up with the action which could have seriously hampered the game. As it stands, Killzone is the best portable FPS game out there, but isn't the best Killzone game. It could have been a lot more with more time, but what we get is a decent package with an entertaining, yet short, campaign and a fun multiplayer mode."

I learned to type using both a manual typewriter & an electric typewriter. I haven't seen a typewriter in years. I had forgotten the feel of typing on a mechanical  keyboard.

If you're used to using today's laptops & desk PCs you will find a big difference in  sound & feel between today's keyboards & the mechanical keyboards of the past. I'm typing this review with the HAVIT X1 & my fingers are getting tired.  I actually like that because I know my fingers are getting a work out. Compared to today's keyboards, you have to push the keys down farther on the HAVIT X1. The HAVIT also has a great typing sound.

The HAVIT X1 is a full sized keyboard...more than likely, the keys are spaced farther apart than you're used to.

The legs on the back prop the keyboard up to a nice slant for typing.

This is a backlit, waterproof (not tested) gaming keyboard. There are several function keys & some function keys are dedicated to gaming. Hold your cursor over the Amazon product photos to view the keyboard layout & the function keys.

The backlit feature is nice. The area surrounding the keys is lit; however, the keys themselves are not illuminated. In a dark room, you can't see the lettering on the keys.

The backlighting will cycle through 3 colors, red, blue & purple. The backlight can be managed by using the FN key along with the key that has the #3 inside a sun icon. It can be turned off, set to your favorite color, or cycle through all 3 colors which is my preference. Cycling through the colors can be slowed down or sped up & also be adjusted for brightness. The keyboard layout diagram refers to the backlight as 'Breathing Light'.

 I've encountered problems with a couple of the keys.  If I happen to hit the left 'Shift' key on the right side, it can be difficult to push down. Also, the 'Backspace' key works great if I hit it in the center, but if I hit it on either edge, I need to push harder to make it respond.

Many people prefer wireless devices, but I am not one of them. I don't like buying batteries which usually have to be replaced often. Plus, batteries are just another item that adds to the landfill problem. This gaming keyboard plugs into your PC's USB port. Its cord measures almost 6' long.

I haven't used this for gaming. So I can't comment on that aspect.

I pressed 10 keys at once without any problems & then counted out 16 & pressed them down. I didn't look to see if every key typed, but can tell you none of them stuck.

All in all, this is a very nice keyboard. Anyone who's spilled a drink on their keyboard will appreciate the HAVIT X1 Waterproof Keyboard. And, the backlight is a fun feature. *well, I think it is*

Video shows fast & slow color cycles, and keyboard LEDs lit with & without room light on.

I will update my review if my opinion changes...but for now this is a 4 star keyboard...I like it.

2694,4,"It feels nice and gave me the extra buttoms I wanted without being too much. Not a bad budget mouse that's for sure. It does feel nice and you can set the dpi super high (16k) that most normal people won't use. The buttoms on the side don't change to a different color which is disappointing. The software it comes with is nice but it runs sluggish. It offers plenty of features to mess with. How long will this mouse last? Probably not to long (at least a year if not two for people whom will be using it a lot) but it's to be expected with cheap budget mouses. I needed an extra mouse to use on my laptop, so I wouldn't have to use my good high end mouse from my desktop. Plus works great if you want to use it on your ps4 and play supported games like fortnite with it."
2695,4,"Well, I recently purchased Jedi Knight II Outcast, STAR WARS for the XBOX version. Back in March 2002 I purchased the Jedi Knight II Outcast STAR WARS version for PC. When comparing the XBOX version to the PC version, I'd have to say the PC version has the advantage. The XBOX version of Jedi Knight II, offers good graphics quality, audio quality, and game play. Unfornatley,(well not so unfornate)I own a 27-inch panasonic flat TV monitor screen, which means it offers very low resolution picture quality. Plugging in the super-vhs support helped and made the resolution twice as clear, but when playing Jedi Knight II, the resolution of graphics was very low. It looked much higher on my compute monitor. Anyway, the texture quality of Jedi Outcast for the XBOX is very good. The Sound effects are equal to the PC version's. And so are the music sound track songs. I think gameplay are equal, but in different ways. The thing that bothers me about Jedi Outcast for the XBOX is the lame controller scheme, which is very difficult to use. And the low resolution TV for me also makes me mad. Though, lucasarts, raven, and activision along with the XBOX team did a good job importing Jedi Outcast from PC to XBOX. The Multiplayer is a little lame, only 2-players are supported. And there is no XBOX live support! Yet, let me talk about the highs of jedi outcast for the XBOX. I was hoping that Jedi Knight II would take advantage of the XBOX's hardware, and it did. It offers a very smooth frame rate per second, while displaying nice dynamic lightning effects. The main menu and other menu design of Jedi Outcast for the XBOX is more advanced than for PC. Also, another thing that bothers me is that you have to complete missions and on higher difficulties to access certain characters and maps in multiplayer, bonus missions in single player, and movies, and the gallery in the extras menu. I'm sure they will come out with cheats later. The XBOX displayed an extremely fast frame per second in areas that my PC lagged pretty bad in. And some areas it did that where my PC lagged a little bit in, and a whole lot in. Well, it is the XBOX, what do you expect?The game play of Jedi Knight II for the XBOX is just like the game play for the PC version. But the Loading Scheme of Jedi Knight II for the XBOX is quite different than for the PC, instead of only loading after you beat an entire level, between areas of the single level jedi knight II is broken up and loads that way. Overall; Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is very good quality and I'd recommend it for most gamers. :)"
2696,4,"This is a good game, but it's not as good as the original The Longest Journey.

The game is certainly enjoyable. The story, characters and acting are all pretty good - certainly good enough to keep you engaged till the end. The new 3D graphics look good and the interface works well enough. However, the game did not impress me as much as the original, so I was a wee bit disappointed.

First of all, I found that the central character, Zoe, was not as well-acted or engaging as April was in the original. Sometimes I got the sense Zoe was just reading lines. You will still like her though.

Secondly, April Ryan is unfortunately not as engaging as April was in the original either. The designers have deliberatly changed her character from happy-go-lucky teenager to embittered rebel leader. I didn't find this very convincing. More importantly, it also means that April has become a lot less fun. She is still very well acted but her lines just aren't as good. I kept willing April to make one of her trademark wisecracks, and most of the time she just said boring stuff like ""I need to go over there"", etc.

In general, the game is less zany and humourous than the original. There are plenty of attempts at humour, but the writing isn't quite up to the standards of the original and it falls a bit flat.

My next criticism is the remarkably easy gameplay. Although superficially it looks like an inventory-based, puzzle-solving game, real puzzles are actually few and far between. For example, most of the time you'll only have one or two items in your inventory, so what to combine with what is a no-brainer. And the game babysits you throughout with hints and directions, in effect telling you exactly what you are looking for, where to find it and what to do when you get there.

The last criticism is that sometimes the plot is downright confusing. Things happen in it which still don't get adequately explained by the end. Which is may be no wonder, because there is no end. The game ends abruptly with all the loose ends hanging in the air, evidently in preparation for a sequel.

The interested buyer shouldn't be put off by these criticisms though. These are only failings in comparison with the original, which was a suberb all-time classic. And though Dreamfall isn't very challenging it's still fun to play through it, like watching a good movie.

So all in all, a solid four stars. Not quite top marks but still a good game."

2698,4,"It's hard to believe that I first played Rayman a full eighteen years ago on my PS1 and then a few years later enjoyed Rayman 2 on my Sega Dreamcast. Since then I sort of parted ways with the Rayman series though not intentionally. I always enjoyed the color and lighthearted fun of Ubisoft's Rayman games and that holds true with Rayman Legends for my PS3.

--------------------
STORYLINE:

Rayman is the silent protagonist and while that can make storytelling a bit more challenging Ubisoft does a good job setting up the plot for Legends. Rayman and friends have been asleep since his last adventure (Rayman Origins) and 5 evil Teensies (like floating faeries) have captured the other teensies and ten princesses across the land. It's up to Rayman and his friends to stop the evil teensies, rescue the captured princesses and teensies and restore peace to the land.

--------------------
GRAPHICS:

Bright, colorful, fun, and full of character are all words I'd use to describe Rayman Legends. Rayman 2 was impressive all those years ago on my Dreamcast and the PS3's enhanced color palette and graphical horsepower play nicely with Rayman. This is a beautiful game with varied levels and themes (more on that in a bit)

Legends presents a main hub where Rayman can enter various rooms to access everything from levels to creature friends, other playable characters, online challenges and more. Worlds are presented as themes like ""Teensies in Trouble"", ""Toad Story"", ""20,000 Lums Under the Sea"", and more. Each ""world"" features a subset of paintings that Rayman jumps into to start a specific level which are also named. Each level features a set amount of Teensies that require rescuing including a 'king' and 'queen' Teensie, and also a specific amount of Lums (think fireflies). At the end of each level your tally of Teensies and Lums are calculated and a level rating is given in the form of a bronze, silver, or gold trophy. Collecting a varying amount of Lums will also unlock bonus tickets that can earn Rayman bonuses like extra Lums or creatures.

--------------------
ONLINE:

The online portion of Legends is presented in the form of daily and weekly challenges. Each challenge is a world-wide competition to set a high-score and your performance is tallied against all other Rayman Legends players. The higher your score the more Lums earned and also a boost to your ""awesomness level"".

--------------------
OTHER MODES:

Also worth mentioning is a 2-player mini-soccer game included in Legends that is both very fun, fast and addictive.

--------------------
THE GOOD:

(+) Appropriate for kids
(+) Bright, colorful levels that drip in imagination and creativeness
(+) Fun platforming fun in the same vein as Super Mario Bros. and other side-scrolling platformers
(+) Levels have checkpoint system so that inevitable resets don't take you to the beginning of the level

--------------------
THE BAD:

(-) Can be quite challenging even for gamer adults, so kids can find the game frustrating

--------------------
CONCLUSION:

Ubisoft delivers another excellent Rayman title that keeps production values high. This is a beautiful, fun game that is appropriate for kids and adults! The degree of challenge will keep even older kids engaged. Recommended!"
2699,4,"I like this controller. I also have the wired version of this model & they both work very well.
For the price they were a good alternative to an actual 360 controler, which i also have, & I feel confident in recommending either model for casual game play."
2700,4,"3D glasses come with Assassin's Creed. The paper type like you used to get when you went to a movie theater.  It is supposed to work with a 2D TV but it looks lame in my opinion.

If you liked any of the previous Assassin's Creed games I think you will like this version also. The underling tones in this game are very similiar to AC II but the gameplay has more nuance.

While the graphics are very good (without the glasses), they do not take your breath away.

The game doesn't require expert controller know-how. Any noob can bash buttons and come out on top in combat. As always the in game camera works well.

There are new types of battles in this version.  One version is like a tower defense. You can put a master assassin on a rooftop which allows you to put crossbow and riflemen on the rooftop also. Now you can shoot at characters below in the streets. It is an innovative way to overcome enemies. Something besides just bashing buttons.

You can turn the blood effects off in this game but even if you did it would be considered violent.

You can play this game casually (read: kill all the things!) or you can perform all the tasks and get into the game on a deeper level. Both are fun."
2701,4,"This game is pretty good. I haven't played any of the previous ones so this is my first in the series. I only played through normal difficulty but enjoyed the cutscenes and feeling like a badass as I beat the levels. If you like a nice action game, this is pretty good. The scaling difficulty levels and unlockable levels add some pretty good replayability to it. The easier settings are easy enough that I can just play through comfortably and relaxed but you can amp up the settings and it becomes a real challenge."
2702,4,I like the game - it is fun for all ages to drive through the different games.  I have had many times playing this with friends
2703,4,good
2704,4,"Works well, even though I bought it used. Battery life is short but I don't use it as often as I should."
2705,4,"Pharaoh is very similar to its predecessor, Caesar 3. While Caesar 3 is Roman style, Pharaoh is in Egypt. Just as Caesar 3, Pharaoh is the game for fans of any Simulation game. As the location of this game is mainly on desert, you have to deal with small ""green"" area where you can put well on it to distribute the water to your citizens. One source for the food is the ostriches that are located in certain area on your map. Therefore, building your city needs a good plan to make sure your citizens are not short of food and water. I really like this game, and you may too! I was playing this game for months a few years ago and now I miss this game and want to play another mission. :D

This game focuses on government. You are required to balance the prosperity, health, and some other things in your city. Make sure that your citizens are employed, healthy enough, well educated, have access to entertainment facilities to keep them happy. You can adjust taxes, hold festivals, open new trading route, and many more!

If you have played Caesar 3, you'll find that playing this game is very easy. All the controls, units, and gameplay is very similar to Caesar 3. Although Pharaoh is not a new game, yet it is fun to play. With a few bucks, you can get great simulation game that might get you obsessed on it!"
2706,4,"I am having a lot of fun with this game and the graphics are amazing!  Playing on a tropical island is too cool!  And my wife is having a blast designing her own multiplayer levels for she and I to combat on.  You start out with basically nothing when you begin creating your level and then you end up with this really neat little world to play in.  I haven't gotten too far into the main storyline yet, but so far this game is definitely worth picking up."
2707,4,"I've been playing Morrowind for the Xbox for weeks now and I think I'm getting close to the half-way mark on the game.
The game's world is huge and there's just too many quests and objectives aside from the main quest that can be sought out.
The game has an extensively huge amount of roleplaying topic context material and text information in NPCs and books.
The game's magic system is relatively good for RPGs with seven schools of magic and a near infinite amount of premade spells,
however, that you can make your own custom spells truly makes for a Wizard character that is truly unique and top notch.
The game's thieving system is also incredible as you can steal just about any item in the game (hope you don't get caught).
Now that that's said, I need to point out a few of Morrowind's down sides - and they may be dealbreakers for new buyers.
First off, the combat in the game is rudimentary and overly simplified consisting of repeated attacks until the enemy falls.
Second off, Morrowind takes quite a bit of time to save and load, taking up to two minutes to load a large save game.
Third, Morrowind tends to crash with ""Dirty Disc Errors"" quite often after the save file reaches 150 blocks or larger and
reaching 150 blocks will not take you very long, despite any efforts you may employ to reduce the save's file size.
Also note that the ""Dirty Disc Errors"" (DDE) have nothing to do with the physical condition of your Morrowind game disc.
Morrowind will often either freeze or crash with the DDE message whenever the game tries to load more than the Xbox's
finite available 64 megabytes of RAM and these crashes will happen often, so buyer beware on this point.
At this point in time, no workaround, fix or Xbox patch is available from either Microsoft or Bethesda Softworks.
Unfortunately, noone has thought of the gamer and come up with a PC CD burn application with a Xbox game patch on it yet.
The Morrowind Game of the Year edition is set to be released in the Fall of 2003, so I would recommend waiting for the update.
Hopefully the updated version of the game will be more crash proof or come with a built in game save file fixer option."
2708,4,"NFL2K does a great job with the 2K4 version of this game, although special teams kick returns are a bit too easy.  Overall, very fun and enjoyable experience

Here's a quick summary of the series

NFL2K: Nice game but too many bugs

NFL2K1: Incredible but key money play are out plays

NFL2K2: Outs don't work any more, but sweeps and flairs the norm

NFL2K3: Catching impossible, probably the worst of the series

NFL2K4: Special Teams too easy

NFL2K5: Special Teams too difficult, otherwise PERFECT

**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2709,4,The nunchuk is a great attachment for the Wii's more 'intricate' games. The only complaint I could give is that it's overpriced for a small add-on to the wii mote. It'd be nice if it had a little more than 2 buttons.
2710,4,gift
2711,4,"The single player I thought was awful. The story was bad, the characters were dull, and you honestly stop caring about an hour into it. I was skipping all of the cut scenes, because they had no impact on how I played the game whatsoever. If this were just a single player game, it would probably get 2 stars.

The multiplayer though is phenominal. It's a delicate and well thought out balance between a level-up shooter, a space western, and a futuristic RTS. The game structures are very similar to every other shooter on the market (CTF, Deathmatch, Zone protect), but the execution makes it a whole different ball game.

You can play the game however you want, and your role fits into your team concept. That's why I love modes like capture the flag in this game. It allows you to take your role you are best at and utilize it toward a team goal. You can play the game a million different ways: as a quick draw offensive player using a sidewinder and your equipped gun, driving a tank right into the enemy base and shelling from afar, flying  a hawk and bombing from above, or my personal favorite, as a defender fortifying your base.

Most FPS multiplayer rely on kills and headshots to give XP. Luckily Starhawk utilizes an XP system that also rewards defensive players who build structures and defend the base. You don't need to be a great FPS player to be great at this game. I personally like to defend my bases, so many of my XP come from auto turrets and building points.

Overall it s a fantastic multiplayer game. Probably the most fun and chaotic I've ever played. I have had some crashing/freezing issues during long multiplayer sessions, but other than that the multiplayer gets a resounding 5 star rating."
2712,4,"Nowadays it seems that the only sports games to buy are from EA sports, an industry giant that has made some amazingly fun and realistic games. So when you ask me what game to buy for NCAA football action, of course this game is the first thing to come to mind. However, there ARE some flaws with this otherwise steller game.
 The biggest thing that I find irritating is how there really is no setting for the A.I. if you're an average gamer. When I switched in between Junior Varsity and Varsity, for instance (approximately novice and normal settings) I found that the game went from boringly easy to (sometimes) impossibly hard. Generally speaking, the things that made the difference where situations that only annoyed, not really challenged. For instance, i found that in several key plays, I would suddenly, even with a hurried play, not be able to get the play off before Delay of Game was called. Other times, my linemen would, upon inspection, simply let the deffense past them to sack my QB or stuff a well designed running play. Once, even, in a crutial last minute touchdown attempt, the game called a Timeout [FOR ME], just two seconds before i was about to start a play. The end result? I got down to the two yard line and ran out of time. If only I had an extra TO, i wonder where that went? Oh, yes, that's right, the game felt it nccessary for me to use it earlier...
 The deffensive scheme wasn't exactly air-tight either. If I played the D-Line i found that my CB's and Safeties would often stand around and not cover the reciever. When i would play CB or Safety, the Linemen wouldn't put any pressure on the QB, and he would often run for a first down. This wouldn't be so bad if the controls really allowed for the player selection to be consistent. I often found that, jsut when I was getting used to switching to the player closest to the ball, the game would sometimes switch me to a player in a very awkward position much further from the ball than other players. The result? A way off tackle and TD for the other team.
 These are really all my gripes from renting the game several times, then buying it, going through four seasons all the while. If it's your first time playing the game, its going to be a blast for your. Cool features like Sports Illustrated covers, create a school (and stadium), and Mascot grudge matches make the game worthwhile, and I definately recommend the game to anyone who's not really picky about playing an absolute realistic game of college ball (most people aren't). The game gets 4 stars from me, but add another star if you're a college fan. All players are sure to find some enjoyment here."
2713,4,"I have had this game since June 5th and have had over 30 hours of game play since then. If you are expecting The Sims 3 to be a beefed up version of TS2 you will be disappointed - while there are some similarities The Sims 3 is really a new game in its own right, with almost entirely new game play. It took some getting used to, to be honest.

The Sims look different, although not as dramatically different as I was expecting. There are now some beautiful custom hairs you can get from sites like Peggy Sims and Mod The Sims as well as custom skins that will allow you to make Sims that look very similar to the ones from TS2. You can make more adjustments to your Sims looks since there are now body sliders that allow you to adjust the build of your Sim, as well as sliders that allow you to make adjustments to almost every aspect of your Sims' face, from the size of his ears to the shape of his jawline. Obese Sims are actually obese and not just sort of chubby like they were is Sims 2. The weight gain and/or weight loss of the Sims is also more gradual and actually requires hard work - it seems that jogging is the best way for a large Sim to drop weight and if they drop the healthier lifestyle as soon as they lose the weight, they will gradually get fat again. Other things you can pick include the pitch of your Sims voice, their favorites (favorite color, music and food) and, arguably the best new aspect of creating a Sim, their traits.

Your Sims traits determine how they interact with other Sims and how well or how quickly they can climb the ranks in their chosen profession. For instance a Sim with the Evil trait will do very well in the Criminal career track while a Sim with the Genius trait will do best in the Medical career track. Your Sim will also get special actions that specifically pertain to his/her traits - a Sim who is a Mooch is able to mooch food and large or small amounts of money or a Sim who is a Daredevil will be able to do the ""Watch This!"" interaction, where they scoop some dirt off the ground and eat it. Daredevil Sims can also challenge other Sims to a breath holding contest in the pool.
Traits affect your Sims behavior as well....a Coach Potato will enjoy watching TV immensely and will want to sleep longer (so get them to bed early!), while a Grumpy Sim gets angry easily or an Insane Sim will talk to himself. Evil Sims will enjoy trolling forums (ha!) or stealing candy from a baby and absent-minded Sims will often stop what they are dong and just stand there because, well, they forgot what they were doing. Traits add more variety to the game and allow you to have Sims who are truly individuals.

You can no longer buy clothes, instead you just send your Sim to the dresser and you can pick their outfit. There is a color wheel and a bunch of designs to choose from so you can customize your Sims outfit. The color wheel also allows you to customize your Sims hair color and you can give them highlights if you want.

Careers work differently - now instead of having to have a million friends and maxing out all your skills to get to the top of your career, you can get promoted and even earn raises just from going to work in a good mood and working hard. You will get promoted faster if you have the skills needed for your job and if you have a good relationship with your co-workers but it isn't necessary.  You can also accept opportunities, which are little tasks that pop up from time to time, to earn a boost to your job performance. Once you have reached the top of your chosen career you can still earn raises or do extra things for more cash, like perform concerts if you are a Rock Star or hold autograph signings if you are a top athlete in the Sports career.

And of course there is the new seamless neighborhood which really is a great thing. You can go anywhere you want in town - anywhere. Your Sim will go by cab, bike or car. Child and teen Sims have a 10 PM curfew and if they are not home by then a cop may pick them up...I'm not sure but I think the cop will take the child to the police station and the child has to stay there for a little bit. I haven't had it happen in my game yet. There is a graveyard you can visit where you can explore the catacombs or befriend some of the ghosts (and make ghost babies!). There are parks where you can meet new people or if you have some musical talent you can play guitar for tips. There is a grocery store where you can buy food, sell your own homegrown produce or fish you have caught and a bookstore where you can buy and sell books. There is a theater where you can send your Sim to watch a movie by himself or with a friend and even a spa, where you can send your Sims for a nice relaxing massage or body treatment or even a manicure.

I haven't begun to touch on all of the new things you can do in The Sims 3 - I gave it 4 stars because I'm not as addicted to this game as I expected to be after a month but it is alot of fun and a great game. Just don't expect it to be like an extension of The Sims 2."
2714,4,"The girls are back once again but this time it is not for their normal JRPG or SRPG shenanigans. Developed by Tamsoft, the makers of the Senran and Onechanbara franchises (both higher paced action games), comes Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. Here you will see the CPU Goddesses and Candidates in an adventure that is much closer to the Warriors franchise, taking out hundreds and thousands of dogoos at a time looking while looking wicked while doing it.

To start things off, players will have only two out of four options available in the main menu. The first is the main story and the second are options; get comfortable because the two other modes are not unlocked until after the main story has been completed.

Hyperdimension Neptunia U follows our favorite competing CPU Goddesses on a brand new adventure as they are being interviewed by two new characters Famitsu and Dengekiko who are based off of actual Japanese Magazines. These two fit in rather well within the already competitive environment that has been well established both in friendships and rivalries that we have come to love and expect from the main cast. As one of these two gets the bright idea to write up fluff piece on the CPUs, the other creatively tackles the younger CPU Candidates for her own piece as she tries to not quite be outdone but also not step on any toes. Seeing how well everything worked out for both articles, Famitsu and Dengekiko set out to combine their efforts with the other eight as they set off to each write a CPU / Candidate article to truly see who is really better than who.

Stages are designed for quick and fast paced action segments and unlike the much longer Warrior style games, Neptunia U keeps things much shorter, clocking stages between two to five minutes max if the player is doing it right. Every stage is identified with a recommended level which should really be followed as playing outside the ballpark will generally get your team wiped out so fast that you will literally have no idea what actually hit you. Stage objectives follow a pretty standard formula in regard to mission objectives, from defeating a specific giant enemy to defeating several hundred or even a thousand enemies without falling in battle.

Since having these sorts of stages all throughout the game this would be boring, there are special stages that do not tell the player anything other than a recommended level. These stages are special and require the player to figure out how to beat them all on their own. These were interesting to take on because there was not much of a lead in and going with the flow was required.

To tackle the ever increasing difficulty of the stages, the girls are going to need to level up. While they do have access to their powerful HDD modes, the limited time with them is simply not enough as the enemies become more powerful. Leveling is handled as it normally would be while slaying enemies and gaining experience to enhance character stats to become more powerful. Acquiring new equipment and accessories however is a whole new system of its own.

Instead of acquiring money or having a synthesis system, all major stat boosts outside of leveling up are handled by the collection of medals from defeated foes. Each foe has a category listing with a counter that easily tells the player how many medals have been collected up to that point in time. Within each of these listings are goals that need to be met in order to unlock new weapons, accessories, and stat boosts. Weapons are character specific so if there is one in particular that you want to aim for, it is easily achievable by simply aiming for missions that contain that specific enemy type. Upgrades to attack, defense, and hit points are passive and as soon as the medal count has been achieved, then the collection of the reward is applied to every available character.

This system works quite well as the players is going to be facing off against a variety of foes over the course of the adventure but does not have to worry about possible low drop rates just to be able to get that other weapon to tip the scales slightly more into their favor. The only issue with the presentation of the medal system is that while it does tell the player the total amount currently held, it does not tell the player how many of the goals have been reached inside of that enemy category. While this is not a big thing near the beginning, hours into the adventure it can make the process feel a bit long when trying to remember which ones have been fully completed and which ones have yet to be sometimes going in and out of every category just to make sure nothing was missed.

Once the main storyline has been completed there are several possibilities that open up. The first of these is in Chapter 4 which contains the final quests with some having level requirements of ninety-nine. For a bit more of a challenge however, the next item down on the main menu opens up in the format of Gauntlet Mode where the player can choose any character including the CPUs HDD forms to go toe to toe in a tournament styled gladiatorial fight. Gauntlet mode offers three separate difficulties however considering the character levels finishing up Chapter 3; this mode feels like it should have unlocked itself steadily over the course of the main game in order for the lower difficulty settings to be more than just a quick trip through the rankings to the top.

Gauntlet mode does offer one other thing that I will be honest appeased, me as a fan of the series since the original iteration on the Playstation 3. There are several constants in the Hyperdimension games and those are the four CPUs alongside Neptunes best friends Compa and Iffy (IF). Starting either with the CPUs or the Candidates, I noticed that the other two were simply not present. Being such a huge part of the series I thought in a way that it did somewhat of a disservice, but thankfully there was nothing to worry about. While they may not be playable, they make their appearance in the presentation of the Gauntlet mode and once that has been won, Iffy throws out something much more sinister and diabolical in the form of Neptral Tower.

Neptral Tower, aka Gamindustri Tower according to the other characters, is a pure fifty floor dungeon crawl to the top. Each floor works like the quests found throughout the main chapter and works quite well in order to finish up missing medal categories as well as helping reach those much higher levels in order to compete in the last difficulty level of the Gauntlet Mode and the final quests of Chapter 4. The tower has but one catch. Whichever two characters are chosen to scale the floors must reach the top before any other character can attempt the same. This could be slightly difficult at times as each character has their own specialties and some larger enemies are made that much more challenging by not quite having the right skills for the job. It was moments like  this that truly showed what the Tower was made of requiring the player to prove themselves if they were going to make it any further to the boss lying in wait on the top floor.

""Hey, Idea Factory! I thought we had an agreement not to cross this line!""
- Neptune

Neptunia U does one more thing other than not being an actual JRPG and that is implementing a clothing break system like those seen in the Senra Kagura titles. This adds one more level of things to worry about when facing off against the hordes of enemies as not only is there the characters hit points to worry about, but there is also the loss of their clothes will result in a defense drop leaving them open to much more damage than they would take otherwise. While this does add a gameplay element that needs to be kept in mind, it also provides a decent amount of fanservice that the series can be known for.

Now all depending on the player there are options that they can choose in regards to the characters clothes. For those like me that will take any advantage they can get especially at higher difficulties where nothing more than a few hits can be the end of stage or a match, there is the option of unbreakable clothes. For those that prefer either fanservice or more of a challenge, easily breakable clothes or already broken clothes can be selected.

The hacking and slashing of Hyperdimension Neptunia U is something different but in a good way from the normal direction of the series. The style and amount of gameplay felt proper against the amount of dialog and banter between the girls making this fit in quite well into the overall series while waiting for Victory II."
2715,4,"The levels are beautiful. Great vehicles, great music. High flying jumps are great fun. Even crashing is a good time."
2716,4,Fun to play and a little feel of Return to Castle Wolfenstein from 2001 but more modern.
2717,4,My son loving it.
2718,4,"I thought this was going to be a disaster like Mechassault, but this game is actually MORE fun then the PC version. There are a lot more things to do, environments are a lot better looking and the turret shooting is a nice addition."
2719,4,Good game but not long enough
2720,4,"I bought this stuff pack mostly for the cool things that my ""sim"" kids could play with. It was a little pricey but a good amount of things were in the pack."
2721,4,"When you talk about Capcom, the developer and publisher has a long and celebrated history. They got their start during the 1980's making video games for the NES. In 1987, they released several of them in hopes of showing that their games were fun to play. Little did they knew that a major franchise was born to humble beginnings; Mega Man almost didn't see the light of day outside of Japan. Capcom decided at the last minute to release it in the U.S. and it led to one of the worst box art designs in the history of video games. It didn't matter because the few players who got their hands on this game realized that there was something cool about it. Word of mouth quickly spread out through the gaming community and Mega Man had gathered a cult following. Oh yes....the Blue Bomber's first adventure left quite an impression on gamers everywhere.

In Mega Man, you control Mega Man (AKA Rockman in Japan), a human-like robot created by Dr. Wright (later on, Capcom changed his name to Dr. Light.) He sought out the game's main villain, Dr. Wily, who re-programmed Dr. Wright's robots to work for him and wreck havoc in the city of Monsteropolis. As Mega Man, you chose from six stages filled with enemies, traps, pits and a Robot Master. Beat the Robot Master of each stage to acquire his special power. After you clear all six stages, you ran through four more stages filled with more boss characters, the chance to fight all six Robot Masters again and finally, you fought against Dr. Wily. You did not have access to passwords or battery backed saves but you were able to pick up extra lives and had unlimited continues.

The PROS: Out of all the games Capcom released, this one stuck out. It was a one of a kind game involving robots, a futuristic setting, the ability to gain enemy robots' powers and interesting stage layouts that put your shooting, jumping and memorization skills to the test. For its time, the graphics were pretty sharp and bright. The sound effects and controls were spot on and easy to appreciate. The music was excellent since each Robot Master's stage got its own theme so it fit the mood perfectly. There was a lot of variety when it came to enemy robots and some were exclusive to certain stages. Mega Man quickly became known as a hard as nails game to play through so if you beat it, you were among an elite group of gamers that managed to pull it off.

The CONS: Since it was really hard to beat back then, it also proved to be its biggest fault. At the time, most games were pretty easy to clear compared to Mega Man. The game had been too much for some players which led to most people who attempted to beat it to give up completely. It was a bit demanding to beat the game in one setting even though you had unlimited continues and enemies would randomly drop extra lives though not as often. It was also one of the few games where you didn't earn extra lives through points so it didn't help at all.

Despite the steep learning curve and the fact that it demanded high gaming skills, Mega Man earned its place in video game history and gave birth to one of Capcom's most recognized video game characters. They would go on to release five more sequels on the NES, a new spin off series for the SNES and PS1 and multiple portable iterations. If you missed your chance to play this diamond in the rough title, you can search for a used copy or pick up the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2 or Gamecube consoles. Also, if you own a Wii, you can download this game from their Virtual Console Service for US $5.00 (500 points.)"
2722,4,"Gameplay is really good. Controls can be a bit wonky like most wii games when you are required to use motion controls. Luckily, the majority of the game doesn't require you use the motion control. You will use off in and on in many areas, but most game play is used by turning controller sideways and playing like a traditional video game. It's a good mix of game play that differs from the Metroid prime style FPS for a nice change up. The storyline and acting is sub par, and actually quite annoying, but the real plus here is they actually did well on the game itself."
2723,4,"Cartridge was in good condition. Game works as advertised. Obviously no original packaging, just the game."
2724,4,I like this thing it comes with a dock and i like that it displays the information on the screen.  sound is great and its convinient that it has a mute and volume buttons.  the only negative i have is that after like 45 min. or an hour this thing gets uncomfortable in my ear.
2725,4,"It's a fun game to play. I enjoyed revisiting the world of A Link to the Past. The new wall walking ability made some of the puzzles really interesting to figure out. I didn't like losing all my items and having to rent them again every time my character died. Some of the mini games are just too difficult for me. I don't think I ever earned more than 15 rupees in the baseball game and I'm lucky to last ten seconds in the cucco dodging game. I liked finding all the lost baby maiamais. All in all, a must have game for Zelda fans."
2726,4,"A game with mediocre graphics, simple gameplay and long load times isn't very exciting.  An that is exactly what this is.  Obviously Sony saw this as well and sold Crash to Konami, who produced it on Xbox and Gamecube"
2727,4,"Am I the only one who's been waiting for this game to be released since 2008? Checking the dead island site only to find it under construction for ages? Well, it's finally here! While not exactly what I expected, it's a nice experience. Graphics are so so, they can look great at times, and meh at others. Stiff character models during cutscenes don't help it much either.  Also, textures sometimes take time to pop in. It's a bit more cartoony then I was hoping for with all the meters everywhere, and the xp points from killing zombies, but I'll deal with it. The multilayer damage feature which was boasted in 2007 isn't really used to its full potential. Breakable bones are a treat though. No split-screen co-op, and the story is a bit weak which is another downer. Maybe I just got my hopes up with the debut trailer and all. You might be thinking now, hey this game sucks! Well, on to some of the good parts now. One thing I suppose I could mention. You play as one of four people who are immune to becoming a zombie, so don't expect there being some sort of you get bit and you have find an antidote. Zombrex anyone?

We finally have fast and slow zombies together in one game. Something I would have liked to see in Left 4 Dead. The island is huge. I often found myself ignoring quests at times just to explore. You can combine weapons, which is a bit meh to me, but that's only because I wanted a bit more of a realistic experience, and an electric sword really isn't all that realistic, but it's still a load of fun. The sound in this game is fantastic. Dead Island is one of the few games that has actually been able to creep me out. When you're in a dark room and you hear a zombie wail, you'll understand what I'm talking about. There are a limited number of guns in the game so expect alot of melee. This game should have and could have been better due to the extremely long delay, but fun. The fun factor makes me overlook the problems with this game. It's definitely worth a rental if you don't feel like spending the 60 bucks. I don't see the price on this one coming down anytime soon."
2728,4,As advertised. No issues
2729,4,"This is great for the price for users that are not rough with it. I do wish it came with a longer cord, an adapter where you could plug it into a standard wall socket, but lost of all the little plugs where your PS4 controllers plug in need drastically to be reinforced. They wiggle back and forth like a 8 year old loose teeth. I can definitely see how others say it breaks off. If they just reinforced those plugs we would be good as gold. The aesthetics of it I love though, and the third charge port is great, and the price is right too. If they improved on these three things I'd easily pay twice the price for this product again. If you go easy with it, it seems to be working fine though. Just not something I'd recommend for kids."
2730,4,x mas gift
2731,4,"This game has given my roommates and I a lot of entertainment over the past year or so.  If you're in the market for this game you probably know the gameplay formula by now: colored notes stream down the screen which you press in time to music.  Such a reductionist view does not really capture what's so fun about the game, however.

Part of the appeal to me is the mastery of individual songs and the challenge of keeping up on the highest difficulty levels.  It's also very entertaining to play in a group setting where people egg you on and insult your poor playing (not that ever happens to me, mind you.)

If you are used to Guitar Hero 2, you should know that some of the mechanics have been tweaked slightly.  You can expect a LOT more notes to be coming at you (whereas most songs in GH2 probably have less than 700 or so notes to hit on expert, expect over 1000 in a fair number of songs in GH3 on expert).  To alleviate some of the difficulty, hammer-ons are *much* easier to play in GH3 than GH2.  Not only are they more visually distinctive (in Guitar Hero 2 the hammer-on notes are all but indistinguishable from normal notes when you have star power activated) but the timing window is much more forgiving - you can play the notes slightly ahead of time and still have them register.

One gameplay addition added from GH2 to GH3 is that of guitar battles.  In this mode, you play against such legends as Tom Morello and Slash.  The purpose of this mode is not to rack up points but instead to make the other player ""fail out"" through the use of special powerups.  I found the addition more frustrating than fun.

Fans of achievements should know that they are incredibly difficult to attain - after playing this game for many dozens of hours over the past year, I probably have only 100 or so achievement points.  According to [...]

Finally, with regard to the hardware itself - make sure you are not situated too far away from the TV or the cord might not reach!  The cord is plenty long in a room with a 32"" tv, but at home where we have a 55"" DLP TV I've yanked the cord out more than once on accident."
2732,4,"This is a heavy plastic case for the vita.  It's more of a traveling case, rather than for carrying around.  It's quite bulky and heavy, which offers great protection, but not very portable unless you travel with giant pockets or even a bag."
2733,4,please
2734,4,I actually loved it. I'm all about games that I can get many hours with. A little repetitive but still fun. I got my money's worth.
2735,4,"There's a small learning curve to get adjusted to the fighting moves and how the camera locks work for the enemies.
However, once you get through that, the game becomes addicting as all heck.  I would suggest that most players should just skip the beginner level - on this level the game is too easy and there isn't enough people to fight.  But on the higher levels, a lot more fun.

The entire samurai-cowboy storyline is a little odd, and doesn't really do much for the game.

This isn't a one to one sword fighting game, but what is there works really well.  This is the closest you can get at the moment to hacking and slashing your way through combat. Motion controls work well.  Overall, I would rate this as one of the top games I have played on the Wii and would highly recommend it  - the other games I enjoy are Bully, Okami, Zelda, Monster Hunter Tri, Resdient Evil 4, FIFA 10, and Tiger Woods 10."
2736,4,"I love the new 3D update. But there's something about the good 'ol 2D MKs that just take our hearts away. This is a great MK. Solid graphics, great control, awesome gameplay, great sound. But there comes a problem when it comes to the cast (atleast for me anyway). There's not enough returnings of the old kombatants. I know we need some new faces, but a bigger cast would have been nice. Remember MK Trilogy on PSone. All those kombatants to choose from? Well, I wish this MK had that. Another thing...there's just too much to unlock. Haha. And the Konquest mode gets very tedious and boring after a while. Other than these few pitfalls...it's a great return to the MK universe."
2737,4,I really enjoyed playing this game.  The graphics are very good.  It was a lot of fun.  I would purchase from this buyer again.  I am very pleased with the speed in which I received this game.
2738,4,Had a small crack but it works so I'm happy.
2739,4,"a little more fragile than i expected, feels great. Recommended."
2740,4,"It's a pretty cool adventure game with a few glaring flaws, but nothing game-breaking. You can selectively form and foster relationships with your crewmembers by spending time with the ones you like most and selecting speech options to let them know how you feel. Each person has an interesting backstory, and there are many fascinating secrets of the world for you to unlock. It's just a little lacking in general polish and a few things are buggy. I think it got released a bit too quickly."
2741,4,"Good game! Good graphics for this console, it could be better in that matter"
2742,4,"""Oblivion"" has breathtaking graphics and sound, and the story in the game itself is both fantastical and one that a player can truly get absorbed in.  The main downside, perhaps, is that there's a lot of running about to get from place to place, whether moving from one task to another or even while trying to complete a certain task.  Sure, the scenery is stunning as you look around while running to your next destination, but it's such a large world and more than once I've found myself getting bored while still... just... running.  Once you're there, though, there's plenty to do, lots of creatures and enemies to fight, all for a common goal.  Definitely worth playing."
2743,4,I really enjoyed it.
2744,4,"I am very happy with this game, because last one (Pro Street) was an error.

The movements and the graphics of this game are very fine.

I don't like the way to follow the history of the game, because it does not have a sequence and in the most of the game you don't know which is the next step to advance in the history"
2745,4,does not work with windows7
2746,4,So fun only problem no split screen :/
2747,4,"Very good game with a series of faults which (for some) may be seen as game-breaking. If you are a Sonic fan, I highly recommend playing this game. It has some great moments and was a lot of fun for me.

The problems arise in its high difficulty and stinginess with lives. For those who want to enjoy the game and not worry about this, I'd recommend visiting Area 2 in the Desert level. There is a section where you get four lives in a row. If you let yourself die and return to that checkpoint, you should easily be able to rack up a large amount of lives. With 99 lives, I was able to enjoy the game a lot more and not have to worry about losing my checkpoints."
2748,4,"Ignore my score for a moment, please, because it doesn't really mean much.  Looking at the scores already here on Amazon.com, I completely understand and can agree with most of them.  As such, it's hard to really place a score on this new device.  Honestly, I don't think there's been such a contentious electronic device launch like the PSP Go in...well, recent memory.  Having refreshed the PSP what feels like a hundred times already, Sony, presumably feeling the sting from Apple's success with the iPhone/iTouch as a digital gaming device, decided to refresh the PSP yet again.  And herein lies the problem.

The Go gets rid of the UMD feature of all of the previous PSPs and embraces the digital world in a remarkable way for a gaming device.  Without getting too far into the ""owning versus not owning debate"" (let's keep this civil), a lot of people have flocked to the iPhone's bite-sized, digital-only gaming and Sony's new direction is pretty much inevitable.  If a way of presenting games is making money, a company will always follow suit.  The problem is that with the lack of a UMD drive, Sony's faithful who've purchased at least one PSP in the past are left high and dry.  For individuals who have a nice UMD collection going, this move can only be met (and has understandably been met) with vitriol, with calls of ""why are you ignoring us?""  There was talk, at one point, of having a UMD transfer system that would allow gamers to somehow turn their UMD into a digital purchase. This was scrapped in the USA even though, from the sounds of it, Sony Europe still has a program for some games.  Then there's the issue of the price.  Buyers can easily purchase the slightly older PSP-3000 for about $170, $80 less than the PSP Go's $250 price point.  To make matters worse, any of the digital products being released for the PSP Go will work on prior models, as long as they have a memory stick.  Yikes.

All of this history going into today leaves the question is the PSP Go worth it?  Well, that kind of depends (with one huge caveat I'll mention in a bit) on the consumer.  The Go is about 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000 (more so for the original PSP) and has a slick sliding system that hides the keys.  When closed, it's roughly the same size as an iPhone, a tad longer, wider and rounder but almost the same size.  Unlike the other PSPs, this one does seem a lot more portable.  It also does look and feel like a nice expensive piece of electronics.  I remember when I first held the original PSP in my hands and it felt like an expensive system; this brings back memories of that day.  While it doesn't have the UMD drive, it does come with 16 GB of storage space (which could cost you $60ish to get the same amount of space on the PSP 3000).  One of the bigger new features, though, is the Bluetooh technology.  The latest firmware update (available today) will allow tethering to your cell phone, which, if your plan allows for it, will allow you to use your cell phone as modem if you don't have Wi-fi available.  It's a nicety and one I won't be able to use (thanks AT&T) but somehow I don't think a cell phone, even 3G, will be strong enough to consistently play online or be quick for downloads.

Not much comes in the box.  You get a cell phone-like charging kit, based on a new framework for charging.  It's kind of a ""one jack fits all"" multi-purpose plug-in.  The cord has a USB connector on one side and the cell-phone-like plug-in for the PSP.  This same jack will be used for other purposes like TV out, etc.  This means that any of your old accessories won't work on the new system.  It also comes with a voucher to download the PSP Go version of Rock Band Unplugged; this version is free to start out and comes with five songs (""Buddy Holly,"" ""ABC,"" etc.) and then you just buy additional tracks &agrave; la carte.  The demo for Patapon 2 comes pre-loaded, as well.  The final thing, besides the manual, is the Media Go software which you can also download from the internet, to purchase games on your PC to transfer to your PSP.  Nothing fancy.  As a quick update, I've had more time to mess around with it and have started using the Media Go to download files.  Like a cell phone, you can plug the PSP Go into your computer through it's power/USB jack to charge the phone.  Media Go acts like iTunes (and has a similar skin) so you can download games through Media Go, directly to your PSP Go.  It's a lot faster.  As an example, it took me around the same time to download/install God of War (over 1 GB) via Media Go as it did Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (200ish MB) via the PSP Go 802.11b Wi-fi.  The synching process will be familiar to anyone who's used iTunes or Zune software and is actually a bit easier and quicker, even if it takes an additional step.

So, again, is it worth it?  This brings us back to that one caveat: the price.  If you're not a current PSP owner, have embraced digital-only gaming and don't mind dropping $250 (as a comparison, you could get an Xbox 360 or a Wii for that price or less; or, for $50 more, a PS3) on a ""new"" gaming system that is technically about four years old in terms of games (meaning, not a ""next generation"" PSP), then yes.  The PSP Go is a worthy purchase.  It's still the same PSP, a strong, powerful device that has a good assortment of fun games.  Even when the most angry at the product, you have to admit that.  It's just a great device, whatever version you buy.  But it's just not as well-rounded and consumer-beneficial as the older, cheaper models.  So, if you're not that person above, either keep (or upgrade to) the PSP-3000 and you have the benefit of not only getting all the new digital games and ""minis"" available today but also play UMDs.

I like mine and am glad I purchased it.  I love the portability of it and the lack of UMDs.  But, I'll be honest, the PSP-3000 is still a cheaper and more well-rounded option."
2749,4,I love it
2750,4,Great game
2751,4,Street Fighter VI is a very good game but Super Street Fighter IV is the definitive version of the game.
2752,4,"You can always count on Double Fine when you need a game that really deviates from the norm. Run by the legendary Tim Shafer, their games are about as unique and funny as they come and Brutal Legend is no different. Sometimes, however, Brutal Legend can seem to be a style-over-substance affair, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This game's style is so completely rad and over the top that it can't help but overshadow the gameplay at times, and that is a good thing.

First off, the game's strength: the art direction. Imagine taking every epic metal album cover you've ever seen, combined with Frank Franzetta's paintings, Norse Mythology, Conan the Barbarian, and anything else you can think of that is metal related. If you associate it with headbanger music, this game has it in some form and it is a very faithful, loving tribute to all things metal. Then, dial up the testosterone to 11. Seriously, this game is epic! The environments really steal the show, and there's a lot of variety. Metal music is a huge category of music, with tons of sub-genres that all fall under its umbrella. This game features it all, from 1970's Black Sabbath era attitude and visuals, to an area that is all goth-black-death-metal. The characters and creatures all appropriately represent all of heavy metals's variety as well. It's pretty cool.

Since the premise of the game is hugely based on a genre of MUSIC, the soundtrack is pretty awesome. I personally enjoy SOME styles of Metal music, but not all. In general, it isn't a kind of music I find myself seeking out in my personal life. Still, I really enjoyed it in this game. It also features the voice talent of Jack Black as the main character. He did a really great job at furthering the charm of the game. It also has some of Metal's biggest figures in real life as well. Lemmy Kilmister(Motorhead), Rob Halford (Judas Priest), Lita Ford (The Runaways), and Ozzy Osborne are all in here, and they do a fantastic job at bringing life to their respective characters, who are already very likable and fairly deep. I was pleasantly surprised. The writing, as you would expect from Double Fine, is both charming and hilarious. The story in this game is campy and funny at times and surprisingly poignant and touching in others. I was very impressed by it. Great job Double Fine!

The gameplay is by far Brutal Legend's weakest point. It's not bad at all, but it really isn't that great. Brutal Legend is a long island iced tea combination of gameplay ideas. In this game, you'll be playing an open-world game, a real time strategy game, a hack n' slash, a music rhythm game, a racing game, and several others. It all really comes across as s a jack-of-all-trades but master of none, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't match the quality of the rest of the game. It is worth noting that fact going in.

Now for the problems I have: There is hardly any variety to the tasks to do outside of the story (hunt this animal, race this guy, shoot a mortar at these bad guys, defend this base, and of course, collectables), but the game sort of requires a bit of it. The tasks aren't poorly executed or bad in themselves, but there's hardly any variety and you'll quickly tire of performing them. Unfortunately, if you want the points to level your magical guitar, axe, hot-rod, character, etc, you have to do them. Also, this game is very, very short without the paltry diversions, about half the length I expected and would have liked. Still, these are minor qualms, and overall this game is one worth enjoying.

Overall, this is a game that exceeds in its art direction, audio, story, characters, and falls a bit short in its gameplay execution, gameplay variety, and length. Does that mean this game is not worth getting? Absolutely not! The strengths of this game are so excellently implemented that the good definitely outweigh the bad, but not enough to keep it from losing a single star. I'd still buy this game and recommend doing so for anybody out there that is interested. For metal fans, this game is a no brainer. Get it. For those that are a fan of Double Fine, get it. For the greater number of people who aren't fans of metal or don't know who Tim Shafer is, I'd still recommend it. It's a very lighthearted, unique experience, and a breath of fresh air from the constant barrage of sameness in games these days. Buy it, headbang to it, bring the enemies of metal to their knees with its awesomeness!"
2753,4,Good game but I haven't played too much of it. Will get around to it eventually.
2754,4,"Seeing as how Fire Emblem:Shadow Dragon is coming soon for the DS and I got curious about the game after seeing it and finding out that it is Intelligent Systems next game, I decided to round up the original to familiarize myself with its' gameplay before it comes out. Well, its' concept is this..A young woman named Lin has discovered she is heir to the throne of Rikea. You are her guardian and advisor, as she fights across hostile lands to build an army and battle for her rightful place at the throne. You're a general who controls an army of troops as it moves across the land fighting other small armies in melee combat. You control dozens of soldiers, as well as magical wizards. You control magic and collect items & equipment that will help you defeat the opposition.  While those, like me, who've played Advance Wars will compare this game to that one in that it is turn-based tactical strategy on a grid map- it is a completely different game in that, instead of a whole troop fights at once,  you fight an enemy alone with swords and lances and magic. It's typical turn-based fare, assuredly, but with a twist. The twist being that, if an individual dies during a battle, they're gone for good. However, specific characters are important to the storyline, so when they die- they don't really perish so much as they retreat. They hang out with the armies of people ready to do battle. When characters reach certain skill levels, they can advance to other classes thus making their presence more known on the battlefield. While the game is a blast to play, I was more brought into the storyline. The story itself has really strong character development and that's what I like in my RPGs.

All in all, I loved the game. I hadn't finished it yet, mind you, but I will. It's hard to put this game down as many reviewers here will tell you."
2755,4,"Here's the deal: I loved getting the guitar and game for around $[...]. But, I had to download the game to my XBOX because there is a bad spot in the disc and it froze on a loading screen every few songs. I didn't bother trying to return it: I just wanted to play the game through anyway. So, a little frustrating, but overall a great deal and my situation doesn't happen very often. If you're thinking about buying this, go for it. I've recommended it to a few people."
2756,4,"First; I'm not a ""hardcore"" gamer but I am a gamer none the less. I have used various gaming keyboards of the years the latest being the Logitech G19 which I sort of wore out. I also tried the SteelSeries Merc Stealth due to the ""gameboard"" to the left of the QWERTY keys which was very comfortable and had an intuitive layout. Unfortunately the layout of the keys to the right of the QWERTY keys was awful. Then I found this. Just what I wanted. I think there are more programmable keys on it then any gamer could ever use. The keys have a nice feel when pressed, the muti-media keys work with my favorite media players without having to adjust any software, the five zone back-lighting is nice to look at, and it is very responsive. This keyboard does what I need it to do whether I am gaming or being productive. I would recommend this keyboard."
2757,4,Still prefer using this adapter over new style controllers. The added volume controls for a little extra bulk can't be beat. I had a pair of Logitech G230s. Picked up a Y-splitter cord and now I can use my PC headset with Xbox1!
2758,4,Great family game it's awesome to play
2759,4,"I can not chose who goes with me and I seam to have to run around everywhere even though I have a vehicle. It is an ok game graphics are nice. Wish I could see the treasure chest on the ground instead of a light. Although Cindy is quite nice looking and she is an expert at fixing vehicles. Who doesn't like a female car mechanic? I like the game it has its ups and downs, but, not the best ff game."
2760,4,I like it
2761,4,"Positive:
+ really, really epic
+ co-op is awesome
+ upgrades are really cool
+ lots of characters to play as

Negative:
- playing as the hobbits is pathetic
- single player mode is way too hard
- the camera still shifts randomly

Lord of the Rings: RotK is one of the movie games that really stands out as actually being good. It improves upon Two Towers in many ways, adding a whole co-op mode, more characters to play as, and updated graphics. It might not be perfect, but hacking and slashing your way through hoards of orcs is undeniably enjoyable.

Return of the King follows the movie pretty closely with three separate ways to go with. You can go on the Path of the Wizard with Gandalf, the Path of the King with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, or the Path of the Hobbits with Frodo and Sam. You can go to any path at any time, which is nice. While the Wizard and King paths are really cool, the hobbits are a pain to play as because they are very weak and their levels are very difficult as a result. The rest of the game is very challenging as well, even on the easy difficulty setting.

The game's levels are pretty huge long with tons of enemies to slash through. The combat system is pretty basic but as you buy more combo moves it gets more complex. Getting to Perfect mode with combos also becomes easier once you start taking advantage of all the cool upgrades. Unfortunately, though, the combo meter is always steadily falling whether you are taking damage or not, which is really annoying as you naturally want to keep a combo when you are progressing through a level between fights.

RotK's main attraction is definitely the two-player co-op play. Grab a friend and you'll have much more fun with the game and it won't be nearly as difficult. This is the main improvement over the Two Towers game, but there are also improvements in the area of graphics. They are a bit less choppy and the details depicted don't look so strange, which makes for a much better visual experience overall.

One of the issues RotK didn't fix, though, is the camera. When you enter another area, it will suddenly shift and make you lose track of where you are supposed to be going for a moment, which gets awfully tiresome.

RotK is also a very cinematic experience. The cut scenes are very cool; with clips from the movie (which are actually a little choppy, unfortunately) perfectly and seamlessly shifting into the game's own visuals when the time comes. Playing as most of the major characters from the movie also makes the experience very cinematic, and although the voice acting is a little cheesy at times it is pretty well done overall. The game is also very epic, particularly when you have hoards upon hoards of orcs to fight.

Overall Return of the King is a great game. It improved upon its predecessor in a few crucial ways without overdoing itself and offers a very epic, cinematic experience much like Two Towers. So if you are a fan of Lord of the Rings I highly recommend you get this game, and if you aren't I would still encourage you to look into it because it really offers some fun, simple action and is great to play with a friend.

2762,4,This was a gift for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it. This game has very cute character designs and good songs. I would recommend this to anyone that is a Miku fan!
2763,4,works well
2764,4,Is Amazon aware there has been a price drop on this game? EB has this game for $19.99 any given day. PS3 version-same price.
2765,4,"Be Careful. I am a gamer, so I use the bumpers a lot. I have had 3 of these and the left bumper has broken. I purchased them in a 3 year period. Also like the other Xbox One controllers the USB plug in can bend.

Movement of the USB can bend the plug in and you can see a lot of games that have to wrap the wire around there controllers to get a charge."
2766,4,"I've played pretty much every RE game except 0 so this was a great buy. I was very excited when it was announced the ps4 was getting this. I'm a big resident evil fan and i have the ps copies on my ps3 and vita but i wanted to see how they updated things and wanted something for my ps4.

There was a slight issue with shipment but item arrived on time and safe.

Upon start up, you get the choice of playing in the original format; screen size and controls. i haven't played both games yet so i'll update my review when i do."

2768,4,"""The combat is a tedious bore."" ""The inventory system is a awful."" ""The characters are too milquetoast and bland."" These were my thoughts after my first play through of Mass Effect several years ago. I wasn't a fan.

I was eventually convinced to give Mass Effect 2 a shot and couldn't get over how much I enjoyed the experience. In light of my strong, positive feelings for ME2, I decided to revisit ME1 again recently. I'm not sure what happened in the intervening years, however I can say that my opinion of ME1 has changed considerably since that first play through.

What Works:

Your companions are mostly well actualized, interesting people. At times you'll make life and death decisions that impact your companions directly. I often found myself seriously contemplating how to proceed and thinking about companions in ways similar to how I'd think about real people. You really feel the immediate weight of your decisions at times. It's a very involving experience.

The story is huge and the writing is really top-notch. It feels like playing through a novel at times. Which I personally like a great deal, but could be a little too slow for those looking for more action.

Opportunities to level your character and companions in different ways are fairly plentiful in this game. Each character has a number of different skills you can play with which adds some diversity to squads and overall game-play.

What's Okay:

The action is on the mediocre side. Combat is like a poor mans shooter. Mostly okay, but Bioware has all the same mapping issues here as it does with all of its earlier games. Expect companions to get hung up behind objects or in separate rooms at very inopportune times. Save often!

What's Disappointing:

At times, the game can feel like its on rails. I sense that the planet exploration was added with the intention of injecting a little more life and freedom into the game and game-play experience. While the planets are somewhat unique they are mostly lifeless husks that require too much time and energy to explore considering what little pay-off there is to be had.

By the mid-point of the game you'll find yourself drowning in equipment, and most of it will be inferior to what you have already. Be warned, if you go over the limit of allowable equipment you will find yourself forced to convert newly found, USEFUL equipment upgrades, into omni-gel. No opportunity to swap out old stuff for the new stuff. You gotta dump the new, good stuff. End of story. The good news is that you can convert unwanted items into omni-gel at any time. Just be sure to do so often, or remember to sell you unwanted stuff to merchants regularly.

Inventory management is the pits. Items are sorted by level and you have to scroll down to review them. You can get really bogged down trying to sell or convert items to omni-gel as you can only do one at a time. A boring, unnecessary time sink.

Conclusion:

I spent more space griping than praising in this review, but don't let that fool you. Sure combat is a bit of a snoozer, and the inventory system is pretty bad. Stil, this is a great RPG and is totally worth your time and energy. This game sets out to engage you as a player and as a person, and I found the 50+ hours I put into flew by.

The Mass Effect series ranks highly on any list of all-time outstanding video games, and anyone even remotely interested in cRPG's should take the time to run through the series at least once. Mass Effect (1) is a great start!"
2769,4,"This game is a lot more fun to play than the first Assassins Creed.  It seems to be way less repetitive.  I never got the platinum trophy there's way too much stuff to do to obtain it.  Although, I have only gotten 1 platinum trophy and that was Uncharted 2 (Geez it was tough)!"
2770,4,"The CronusMax is a great device that truly works flawlessly with nearly any controller on any gaming machine.  There's no lag in response time with the device.  While this is a spectacular device, it has its flaws that make it less than perfect.  It cannot store you're settings, so every time you want to play, you must re authenticate your controller, which is a pain.  If the developers could find a way to store your settings ( via a switch, button, or other way) i would pay twice the cost.  If you use this for a Xbox 360 controller you can get a Xbox wireless gaming reciever to play wirelessly."
2771,4,I do love how the game looks now compared to Sims 3. The content is thin. Gameplay hasn't improved much. Still the same thing better package. In some ways it's worse than the sime 3 but people have said enough of that. I still enjoyed it and spent many hours on it though.
2772,4,The new features and clothes for this stuff pack are nice and fun and definitely add fun and festive outdoor options and ideas. A lot of the stuff available though is almost like versions of items already available through other packs. Some things such as hot tubs now have more options if your looking to make a Sim's oasis outside it's definitely a stuff pack meant for you. Though it's still worth the money even if you are only looking to add some fun games to a backyard. Sims Three base game required before downloading.
2773,4,"Its a great substitute for the Nintendo .I bought it for my brother, he installed it and it works fine."
2774,4,"Here's a mini-review of Wave Race: Blue Storm, brought to you by the fine folks at Nintendorks.
""With any console launch, game companies are apt to bring a successful series into the next-generation, making full use of all the new graphical advantages while trying to retain that stellar gameplay core. Nintendo has done just that with the release of Wave Race: Blue Storm, the sequel to the near-launch N64 version released five years previous. But rather than develop the game internally, Nintendo handed the series to NST (responsible for the underrated Ridge Racer 64), one of the many development houses in its vast second-party lineup.
Those expecting a radical shift in design from the first game will be greatly disappointed; Blue Storm follows the Wave Race model closely, as the game exhibits a very similar ideology in terms of track design, control and basic gameplay mechanics. But once you get over that, you will find what makes Blue Storm so special: a control system that has been fine-tuned to perfection, a dynamite weather system and a water and wave dynamic that is simply unparalleled on any other console. Throw in a plethora of excellent modes and some new gameplay additions (turbo boost) and the message becomes clear: Wave Race: Blue Storm is simply one of the most well-crafted and defining games that the GameCube has to offer at launch.
There are those who might be quick to point out that Wave Race: Blue Storm is remarkably similar to its 64-counterpart, and there is only one response to these criticisms: they're right. There is no denying that NST has not radically changed the basic nature of the game. But there is also no denying that Blue Storm is simply a superbly designed racer. The spot-on control and varying weather are the game's big calling cards, and Blue Storm delivers these elements in shining form. Coupled with striking graphics, an excellent multiplayer mode and incredibly realistic water motion, these components come together to make one congealed mass of fun. This is an impressive debut for NST on the GameCube, and they could have done no better job than preserve the legacy of the Wave Race series so perfectly with Blue Storm."""
2775,4,Love all nancy drew games. The ghost of thornton hall was eerie and not as hard as some others. Thanks!
2776,4,"Once again Nintendo and Retro Studios come out with another pretty darn good game. I loved the first Metroid Prime, and I can almost say the same about this one. The controls and graphics are much the same. The atmosphere of the game completely isolates you, so you better have a buddy next to you. Overall the game will use you to its will, no, just kidding. You'll injoy this game, and I also recommend the first Metroid Prime."
2777,4,"This game is a great addition to the Action JRPJ genre.

The towns and worlds are very well detailed and the game has a large cast of characters.

I really don't know what else this game provides as the online is currently down, but it is a fun game in its own right.

Just don't expect more than that especially since the Wii can't really support more than that."
2778,4,My kids have the lego star wars complete series which is amazing. They seem to like this game. I think it is a bit more violent than the other game and they don't seem to be involved in the story as much. They still seem to enjoy it.
2779,4,The head set is comfortable and the sound is great.....this head set has a wire but don't worry the cord is plenty long enough.......
2780,4,it is a good shooter game if you can tune out the F-this & F-that that they like saying through out the game..its got a good story line also.
2781,4,Nice at at a good price.
2782,4,good
2783,4,"sof 2 is a great game but to get the most of it, you need a modern card like Radeon or Nvidia"
2784,4,"The game requires the internet and an Apple mobile device to get the full Story mode game. Only iTunes has their app for help the dog.  And you can only access one of two stock markets with your internet. If you don't have internet at your real home, your down to one stock market to play.
If you have a 40G PS3, don't try to purchase the digital version of this game. You will need to have more than double the space needed to download and then install the game. You will need a bigger hard drive."
2785,4,"This is a ok game. Doesn't expand much from part 1. Actually 1 set the tone, they fell short with this sequel by trying to appeal to everyone do to the pressure with Gears of War series at the time. Yeah the main guy is all a sudden a good-bad guy. They just tried to add so much to this game but it fail short because it didn't have 1 big key selling point. yeah big multiplayer matches but woohoo at the time COD was unstoppable. The story was ok nothing too hard to understand. Gameplay was kind of the same as 1 focusing on cool weapons. Good graphics. Yeah this game doesn't do anything you couldn't do in part 1 but it is a pretty good sequel if you was left wanting more after playing the first."

I haven't had this much fun with a Star Wars game since Dark Forces.

I think some of the other reviewers are right in that the game controls are awkward - particularly those bloody camera angles. I did take a star down for that. However, I haven't found it too difficult so far. It just takes a bit of getting used to. I spent some time in the training room first. There are a lot of force moves (my favorite so far is simply throwing objects at people.

However, I don't think the criticism about it being too easy is justified. I think the point of an easier game is to let casual gamers play as well. The game does have different levels, so if Padawan is too easy, you can try Sith Lord difficulty.

For the price,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Force-Unleashed/dp/B00113T0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</a>&nbsp;is a good deal of fun."

2790,4,"I see that many people posted reviews about this game that are about 7 pages long.  I don't think that's really necessary.  Halo has been around for years and has held the championship title for first person shooters for quite some time.  The entire Halo series provides a compelling story, great graphics and excellent FPS controls.  So, if you don't know that Halo is a good game, you've either been in exile for the last decade or simply not a gamer.  That being said, I am impressed with this port to XBOX360.  Why?  Because this is not just an old game that the developer through into a new package, marked it ""HD"" and put it back on the market to cash in.  they actually did some work - and some very fine work - at improving the visuals of the game.  The difference between the original XBOX version and this installment is vast.  I actually went from playing Halo: Reach to this game and couldn't really notice much of a difference.  That's how improved the graphics are.  So, if you are a Halo fan or you've just returned from exile and want to check it out, this version is certainly worth picking up.  This game should be in any XBOX360 owner's library.

PROS
 - Same great Halo game - controls, story, gameplay all rock
 - Vastly improved graphics for the 360

CONS
 - Some of the AI voice acting seems a little outdated compared to newer titles.  Your teammates can get repetitive and annoying after a while."

2792,4,Product as described...fast delivery
2793,4,Good games
2794,4,"Fast shipping.  Product not supported by Logitech game-panel software like I thought it was, and the game software that runs it is a bit iffy, but still a good product."
2795,4,"I'll cut right to the chase: GV is an incredible game.  Yes, it features a bizarre control scheme that seems to be asking you to ""wax on / wax off"" an awful lot at first but it all makes sense later.  You have to divorce yourself from the idea that you're playing a standard, run around and shoot things game.  Instead, you're playing a fly around and shoot things game.  Learning to fly is quite difficult, but once you get there it provides for an incredibly unique, truly three dimensional gaming experience.  Playing GV is like performing a martial art: you will be weak at first but as you go along you will slowly morph into a master and literally float like like a butterfly and sting like a main battle tank.
Some words of warning though: GV is difficult...OK, really difficult...OK, incredibly, insanely hard.  It is a throwback to the days of video games that don't hold your hand.  If you aren't the patient sort or if you just enjoy rolling over the opposition like a juggernaut, GV may not be for you.  Also, it is lacking some features that should be standard these days.  Halo has shown us the way and GV really begs for a split screen cooperative mode and a deathmatch mode (GV deathmatches would be just awesome).  You also cannot go back and replay levels you've already beaten just for the heck of it, there are no controller configuration options, and there is only one difficulty setting.  It is these ommissions which keep the game from recieving the five stars it really should have.  Hopefully they fix all this in the sequel.  (Smilebit: there will be a sequel, right?  Please!)"
2796,4,"Good headset nice mic, picks up a  lot of background noise though. I don't really see much point in buying this over a normal headset but I liked the wireless feature and I didn't need a big headset."
2797,4,"I had seen this game sitting on the shelves of software stores for months.  When the price finally lowered I decided to buy it.  It was well worth my money.  The game is absolutely stunning.
The first thing to note is the graphics.  The textures aren't really that detailed, but that doesn't stop them from preforming.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful.  Playing the game makes me want to visit Rennes le Chateau for real.
The next good thing is the soundtrack.  It is perfect.  Every scene has a unique track.  Sometimes I have the character just stand around doing nothing so I can enjoy the music.
Lastly the story is fabulous.  It has some great supernatural influence, as well as classic detective work.
I take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing, but don't let that stop you.  If you really need to you can always find a walkthru."
2798,4,"Minigames. This game, frankly, hasn't aged all that well. Although, the surgical games are pretty fun, many are very difficult and will result in frequently replays. This wouldn't be that much of a problem were it not for the fact that one needs to replay the text sections just to get back to the minigames. I found myself frequently sitting through the same story sections while jamming on the buttons to get through. Too bad I couldn't skip through these sections. I would lose my concentration and focus on something else. There was some nostalgia in revisiting this game. It made me aware of the limitations touch screen games had 9 years ago. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel with some gameplay tweaks."
2799,4,"In this game you play with an old Ezio Auditore, it is not as relevant as ACII but AC  is kind of my style of game."
2800,4,"If you've played any of the previous portable Lego games by Traveler's Tales, you'll feel right at home with Lego Batman 2. The only real changes to the formula this time around are the suits that Batman and Robin can change into to solve some of the many little puzzle elements that you'll encounter throughout the levels, not to mention bosses (Really, I've only beaten Lego Pirates on the PSP/DS/3DS so far, and that game contained no boss battles).

Unlike many of the Lego games, all of the levels in Lego Batman 2 follow one big, original storyline. This is also the first game in the series to utilize talking characters. While I don't mind this change at all (Besides, I could hardly understand some cutscenes in previous installments), I found Batman's voice to be very monotone. Thanks to the recent Lego Movie, I know they could do better on that aspect. I will say, though, for a DS title, there's plenty of cutscenes, and in a 3D platformer that's GOOD to boot!

The tried-and-true gameplay mechanics fare well here. You run around the environment, smash Lego objects, collect studs, and solve puzzles. The puzzles are usually straightforward, but some can actually make you look around for a bit before finding the answer. There's also a good amount of enemies to beat up, and Batman and Robin would sometimes even pull off a flashy finishing blow.

Really, the only problem with the game is that it can come off as repetitive. The gameplay never truly evolves, nor is there a lot of variety. Also, for a game with the subtitle, DC Super Heroes, it's disappointing to see that those heroes show up only at the final level of the game, with the exception of Superman.

But overall, if you enjoy playing the Lego games, there's no harm in picking this one up. If you don't like the Lego games, then this won't help. If you're new to the series, and enjoy platformers, then feel free to hop in! You just might like it."
2801,4,"Not the best first person shooter game that I have played, but it's good enough. Because it's PS3, there is a lot more detail and much better sound. The main reason that I bought this game is because of the absolute lack of WWII Pacific games. Other then that, not much different from any other fps game."
2802,4,Good gift idea
2803,4,"Unlike many others, I decide to hold off my review until I actually got a good feel for this game.  Received the game 3/8 and had almost a week of playing time.  I've logged over 30 hours so far!  I'm definitely enjoying it.

Overall, I'm very impressed this with game.

 A lot of complex ways to build a city.  You have several different specializations are well (Oil, mining, gambling, tourism, and hi tech industries).  Have one city in the region be a Las Vegas, the next a Houston with large oil refineries, then the next a Silcon Valley.

The region mode is a major plus and quite brillant.  I hadn't tried multiplayer yet, but after starting my 3rd city in my region, you can see why it's appealing option.  The idea is that one city can't have it all and that you'll need to trade and specialize.  Currently I have one city specialize in oil, another with a university, and I'm starting on one that will specialize with Ore and Alloy.  It's a pretty sweet concept to have one city that's completely industrialized, producing many jobs.  Then the next city over a modern suburb and having residents commute over.  I wanted to explain all this because I'm seeing many complaints that the cities are too small and can be built up in an hour.  That could be true that's the case, but where's the creativity?  Where's the heart and style?  Did you specialize?  Sure you can build a plain city that quickly, but you're missing the point of the game.

Now onto the negative side of this game.  I didn't think having an online only in SimCity was a big deal like others were making it out to be, especially with the fact that you can privatize your regions.  However EA only lived to that hype by having the servers overload and crash the first two days of release of the game, so bad it made national news.  It's the reason why you see 3000 reviews on Amazon currently, yet only 1.5 stars rating average.

At the moment, the game has been dumbed down.  Cheetah mode isn't enabled, I can't send money to other cities in my region, leadership boards turned off.  While I know EA and Maxis will fix their errors eventually, I hope in the future they realize that these DRM games won't work unless they truly invest in providing the infrastructure for their fans.  That said, I am

There are a couple negatives in terms of actually gameplay.

The biggest one is the traffic system is a complete nightmare once you start to reach a population past 50k.  Maxis addresses this in their strategy guide by saying design roads differently by watching for clogs, add expensive transportation infrastructure and I mean expensive!  One of my cities reached a population of 150K and the city was pretty much shut down due to major traffic delays.  I added buses, streetcars, more roads.  In the end I had over cots of 10000/hr invested into my mass transportation and no improvement in traffic flow, with my overall budget looking grim thanks to the increased costs.  I ended up destroying my entire city by leveling every building with the help of unleashing a giant lizard!!  Then I decreased road size in neighborhoods to limit the density in the city.  The city now sits at 60k and traffic has been much improved.  Seems silly to see Maxis set challenges for people to have a population of 2.5 million when I can barely survive with a city with 100K.

Why is traffic congestion such a problem?  On a micro level, when traffic starts to pile up you can see 1-3 cars blocking an entire intersection when hundreds of cars could of easily gone thru in another direction.  Maxis can blame the users for not understanding traffic flow, but it's clear there's a fundamental problem with this and I hope a update will eventually address.

The only other one I have an issue with so far is residents commuting between regions.  In my 2nd city, I have nearly 1000 people unemployed as I set it to be a suburb/college town.  Yet only half of that population with commute to the next city over, my oil town, which has nearly 5000 job postings.  What gives?  I setup regional trains and buses, yet no one will do the drive over to the next city.  Isnt that the point of regional play?  I'm hoping it's just a bug related with the server issues they are still working on.

Overall though, I love this game.  It's the best city builder out there by far and I'm hoping fixes and the eventual expansion packs make it even better.  Feel I'll log at least 100 hours easily by the end of the month and I definitely recommend it.  Don't let the 3000 negative reviews defer you from buying this game.  1500 were made at the same of the release and based purely on emotion.  People have every right to be upset at EA, I agree, but I feel many people will miss out on a great game if they solely looked just at the avg review this game currently sits at."
2804,4,"Knack is a retro kickback to platformers of yore. Simple easy to master controls meet straight forward, yet challenging, gameplay. It is the perfect family game or one for those who remember the classic days of Mario, Gex and Sonic. The game is set in a quasi 2.5D world, with the environment and characters in 3D... but the movement limited to a 2D plane, forward and back with some more open levels, but still linear in design.

The graphics are phenomenal and look plucked right out of a pixar film. Very crisp, clean and with zero slowdown and aliasing. A nice showcase of early PS4 visuals.

Sound is good, with nice voice acting. Though, there is little of it. Limited to the soundtrack, footsteps and some kick and punch sounds. Very little in the form of environmental sounds. The soundtrack is the real star here. Very nicely orchestrated with music that would sound incredible in any live action movie. It is one of the highlights of the game.

Controls are straight forward and simple. A couple button pushes and stick movement. The perfect game to introduce your girlfriend or wife into 3D gaming with.

Overall, it is a fun game. There are a lot of collectables that will have you coming back to play again to get them. The gameplay, while simple, gets more challenging as the game progresses. As you collect particles in the environment, Knack grows larger and more powerful. Letting you absorb more hits and deal out more punishment. There are also crystals which allow you to use limited power moves, to keep things fresh and give you an extra kick for harder enemies.

There is no real change in gameplay throughout, but what is there is solid. If you like old school platformers with simple, yet challenging gameplay... Knack is your go to game for the next generation of consoles. If you are easily frustrated and get bored quickly with repetitive gameplay... Rent it. For me, I found it a nice change of pace. This is a game I will continue to play long past completion, just to collect more pieces and take a break from the shooters that tend to make up a large portion of titles available for any system. Something my wife can also enjoy, even though she is terrified of modern control schemes."
2805,4,"You get to draw your hero, weapons, bridges, platforms, health points and whatever else you need. You can change forms from your hero to a blob or spider.
There is an evil villain named Wilfre who stole all the color in the world.  You have to restore all the color  by going through the levels and collecting color drops. Then you go to a colorless spot and you tap the screen and you will begin coloring. There are enemies to try and stop you and you have to defeat them. You can gain health by collecting whatever you drew as your health points to keep yourself alive.
It is somewhat challenging because of the obstacles in your way. It is fun and entertaining because it lets you create and design everything your way."
2806,4,"This game is fun to play online (when you find the right crowd to play with that is!) for awhile.  But even that gets a bit old as you play through the same levels for the 1,000,000 time.

Campaign mode is a huge dissappointment.  You can tell that all the focus was put into the online part when in development.  The campaign mode felt like it was thrown on at the last minute.  You couldn't be the star of the show most of the time which was a huge letdown.  Think playing a Metroid game without being Samus or a Zelda game without you being Link.  You have to give your franchise hero a bit more playing time when that is what people are buying your game for.  Halo fans want to be MC  not some side character for most of the game.

I'd honestly suggest Half Life 2 over this game.  Mostly because you get a game that has great online and a great single player campaign."
2807,4,Or something like that.  I really enjoyed this game and think it is one of the best superhero games I have played.  Highly recommend it.
2808,4,"This game matches with the real thing quite well, but has too few questions to endure.  If you've never seen the show, it's simply a series of fifteen, each increasing in dollar amount until the last, million-dollar question.  It's drawn out.  There's a speech clip for each dollar amount, answer, and other things.  The infamous ""final answer"" option only appears when you take a while to answer, unfortunately.  The lifelines are realistic, minus the fact that ""phone a friend"" is really ""phone Regis's friend"".  The ""fast finger"" scrambles the choices, and the first correct key pressed wins.  The graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations.  I recommend this for Millionare fanatics or trivia people, but only those who won't run out of questions."
2809,4,The gloss is a little gross to touch sometimes. Otherwise it's performs just like the matte black one I had previously. That one lasted from 2012 until I just didn't want to clean the funk off of it in 2016. Good mice.
2810,4,"Works OK so far.  Voice commands are spotty though I will say the Kinect is a BIG step up from the last one.  Played Kinect Fitness and it is way more accurate than its predecessor.
Some apps are glitchy and the library of games isn't much yet... but give it time.
As far as watching TV through it goes, it doesn't seem to recognize all the channels but that may be a user error.  I purchased a splitter because I don't want to always use the Xbox for TV at this point.  Too glitchy.
Over all I am happy with the console but if you don't have the cash right now, hold out."
2811,4,"I am really liking this game. It is fun, good story and the graphics look pretty darn nice.
I do have a few complaints though. The models lips are so far out of sync with the speech it isn't even close to being on. It reminded me of playing a much older game. Another complaint is, this is pretty much a reskinned far cry game w/ a woman as the main character.
It is a really fun game. I would have given it 5 stars if it were more unique/original and if the characters mouths were more in sync with their speech."
2812,4,But it's still a pretty amazing game for a PS2 and it's really rare to find PS2 games nowadays so this is just a treat.
2813,4,"I hated Assassins Creed 1.  I mean absolutely despised it.  The controls were terrible, the story was weak, the main character was a jerk that you couldn't connect with.  It was so bad that I was tempted to not even play part 2.  I am so glad that I did.  First off, if you've never played part 1, don't.  You don't need to.  This game begins with an entirely new character, one that has nothing to do with Altair.  Part 2 follows the life of Ezio, a completely new character in a new time.  Overall this game was a HUGE improvement over part 1 in nearly every way.  The controls felt better(though still not perfect) the storyline was GREAT.  My only complaint with the game was a slight issue with the money.  You make more money than you could EVER spend in the game.  I was barely halfway into it when I had all of the weapons bought, upgrades, paintings, etc. and I was still raking in cash with nothing to do with it.  A very small complaint on an otherwise amazing game.  If you played part 1 and weren't a fan, don't fear, part 2 makes up for its faults."
2814,4,"So I never played the first Fable.  And somehow, I managed to dodge the hype machine surrounding either release.  I came into this game without the sky high expectations that some seem to have had, and maybe that enabled me to enjoy the game more.  Maybe it was just that fun.  Either way, I think Fable is a very worthy entry into the 360 lineup and a game not to be missed.

So the good first.  The game is beautiful.  Lush scenery, good character models, and just an all around graphical wonder.  The sound is also pretty good...not perfect as I'll talk about below, though.  And there's a lot to do.  You can rush through the game in about 10 hours or so, but the game provides side tracks that are truly compelling and leave you not WANTING to rush through.  Building relationships, building a real estate empire, doing side quests, killing bandits...there's just a lot to do.  The depth of the game is accentuated in the way your actions affect everything.  You can be good and beloved by all...you even get a little halo when you're good enough.  You can be evil and feared by everyone...complete with your own set of horns.  Virtually nothing you do exists in a vacuum.  Kill someone in Grand Theft Auto and it's forgotten once you're out of the screen.  Kill a Fable villager and you may see an impact on real estate values...your appearance...the price a terrified shop keeper gives you on a trinket...your wife's opinion of you.  You get the point.

It's not all gumdrops and roses, though.  There are glitches that leave the game feeling less than perfect.  Visually, there's a big fade in effect...that is, you see nothing in front of you in the distance and suddenly a guy pops up right in front of your face as the graphics engine gets to rendering him.  And the sound, while good, is limited to an annoying degree.  Villagers will say the same things over and over and over again.  The relationship system is not perfect either, seeming overly sensitive a lot of the time.  Give a couple of thumbs up and maybe a little dances to a woman in the game and she's ready to have your children.  One off color joke and you're the most hated man around.

All in all, it's not a game without significant flaws, but a compelling story and a truly deep experience in an artistically beautiful setting make this a great game to play.  Highly recommended."
2815,4,this is a pretty fun game. it is fun to play and the story is good the graphics are great and the character you play is cool. this game is pretty good.  if you have not played this game then I recommend you do
2816,4,"Works Nicely, and is comfortable. It doesn't seem as responsive on the PC as an Xbox 360 wired controller though."
2817,4,Bueno
2818,4,This is identical to the original Fable game that came out for xbox just with updated graphics. The original was great and therefore so was this but without added material it truly feels like Im playing the same game I beat hundreds of time.....because I basically am. Get this if you have never played fable or if your just a diehard fan of the series like me.
2819,4,"I'm a big fan of Diablo 2, and overall, I loved this game. I've played it many hours, and made it to Act 2 Inferno thus far. However, there are too many cons to give this game five stars.

Pros
__________
You can join a game with random people for any quest you want. It helps when you need to kill Diablo and Belial.
You get better gear when you play multiplayer games and/or kill elite mobs.
You can make private games and not have to deal with the idiots that spammed Diablo 2 games.
I loved the plot. (except for my favorite characters dying.)
You get cool followers in single player mode.
You get tons of cool spells/moves and passive skills, and they are easy to use and customize.
Potions and gems stack, you get better gems, and you can reuse gems.
You can improve your blacksmith, jeweler, and stash.
New classes make gameplay more interesting.
You can redo any quest you did already.
You can sell your old items in the auction house.
You can carry and stash more stuff than in Diablo 2.

Cons
__________
Can't play offline. It is terrible when either the internet goes out or Blizzard's servers are out.
Inferno mode is practically impossible. Don't bother.
Repair costs are WAY too high. 40k gold for repairs? WHAT?!
No jewels or runes.
You characters only go up to level 60. The enemies keep leveling up, however.
You have to rely on the auction house too much to find good gear.
My favorite old classes aren't in this game.
Blizzard randomly has ""scheduled"" updates they never tell you about, and the game sometimes is down ALL DAY.
No Horadric Cube, easily the best part of Diablo 2.
Real money auction house is pointless. I don't want to pay real money for fake gear.
Game is a little too short.. I hope for the expansion soon.

Overall
__________
Definitely worth buying, but know that it is not exactly the same as Diablo 2. Also know that some characters die. Keep in mind the cons before you buy. I actually thought it was just as good as Diablo 2, but in different ways. Playing as a demon hunter is really fun, and I highly recommend that class.
If you buy this game, get items with resist all elements. It will come in handy in Hell and Inferno difficulties."
2820,4,"Most reviewers will give this game a high score, and despite the paid ad BS going on in gaming ""reviews"" today I would agree in this case. The only cons or negative that keeps me from giving it a 5/5 stars is that you kinda know who the bad guys are and they are not really all that ""bad."" I mean in the end yes they do bad things, but all of the deeds seem kinda childish, like a old Bugs Bunny cartoon kinda."
2821,4,"I purchased this primarily for the blu-ray player.  For me the game functionality was secondary.  That being said, there are a couple of shortfalls with this system.

First of all there are no IR inputs, so my Logitech Harmony won't work with blu-ray or standard DVD playback.  That is a huge shortcoming for me since 80% of the use of this system will be with movies rather than games.  The only way I can have this system work with my Harmony remote is if I purchase a $30 third party remote.  Since a small factor in my decision to finally purchase this system is that things like wireless connectivity and online play are standard, this is a disappointment.  Anyone who is a 360 owner can tell you how old it gets being nickel and dimed by Microsoft for everything that isn't included in the standard system.

Second of all, what is with the huge load times?  I purchased Gran Turismo 5 with the system and before I could even start playing a game I had to load an update to the system itself and then an update to the game.  I'm aware of the fact that the 360 sometimes requires updates, but they hardly seem as long as the ones I had to endure before I could play GT5:P.

Third, why doesn't this come standard with the dual shock controller?  There shouldn't be a need to elaborate on that point.

Overall this system is great and performs as expected, but there are a couple shortfalls that the fanboys fail to mention while they're talking up Sony."
2822,4,"First and foremost about the time everyone is talking about. There is a total of 6 missions in the game. The main one, Ground Zeroes, is the longest. The total time it took me to complete everything was 7 hours. So that is not bad for a $30 game.

Now I know all kinds of people are saying you can finish the game in 10 minutes. That however is not correct. You can finish the main mission, Ground Zeroes, in 10 minutes if you know what you are doing. Average time for most people when they first play the mission is 1 1/2-2 hours. It took me about 2 1/2 myself because I was taking my time and exploring around. The whole game itself with the side missions is on average 5-6 hours long.

The game plays very similar to Peace Walker minus all the grinding. It has the same inventory system and controls. There is no radar at all in Ground Zeroes unlike previous Metal Gear games. You first have to spot the enemies with your binoculars then they will be displayed on your map. Another cool little feature is once you get spotted by an enemy, time slows down for a brief moment and you have a few seconds to quickly put the enemy down before they alert everyone. I thought it was a pretty cool feature.

There is still an FPS mode where you can aim down the sights of your gun for more precise shots. And you can still wall hug, crawl and roll. Another new feature is you can now drive vehicles, something previously not available in an MGS game. CQC is still a feature. You can throw, choke out, slit the enemies throat and interrogate them. Some of them will reveal locations of surveilance cameras, weapons, other enemies ect. You can also approach each mission how you see fit. Either stealthily or go in Rambo style. Unlike the older MGS games you can actually get away with shooting up the place if you want. I prefer going stealthy myself because this is a Metal Gear game after all.

The entire game takes place on one map which is a large camp. But depending on which mission you play it will be daylight or night time. The map is fairly large but not a giant open world map. It is very similar to the average Hitman level basically.
You get a ranking at the end of each mission and depending on your rank you unlock weapons which can be used on other missions. That alone can add replayability for some people.

Graphically the game is one of the best looking games on PS3. The Fox Engine is definitely a powerful engine and is also more improved from the engine used in MGS4. I was pretty impressed, especially during the daytime. Everything looks great and the animations are top notch.

The cutscenes are still very well done in typical Metal Gear fashion. One thing I will note is this is by far the most serious Metal Gear game that has been released so far. A lot of the typical Metal Gear humor is no present in this game. Which leads me to believe that Phantom Pain is going to be a much darker game than anything we have seen from Kojima.

The 6th mission is a bonus mission and is different depending on the platform you buy it for. In order to unlock the mission you have to collect 9 XOF patches scattered around in the main mission. For PS3 and PS4 it is called Deja Vu. It is a mission where you go and recreate scenes from MGS1 and is an awesome throwback to first game. I don't want to spoil too much, but there is a very special bonus in that mission if you answer all the questions in a surprise quiz at the end.

Now down to my only real complaint. Now while I think Keifer Sutherland is a decent voice actor, I can't really get over the fact that David Hayter is not voicing Big Boss. Especially since the Japaneese voice actor has stayed the same. I can't really say how well of a job Keifer does given the length of the game and Big Boss really doesn't have a lot of dialogue in this game. I will have more of an opinion once Phantom Pain is released.

I am just going to say in my opinion no one can replace David as the voice actor for Snake/Big Boss. This is just my opinion but being a long time fan I am way too used to David Hayter voicing Snake/Big Boss. Maybe Phantom Pain will change my mind, but we will have to see.

Overall the game is awesome and I believe any Metal Gear fan should be happy with this short and sweet game. I think I like the direction the series is going but I can't say for sure until I play the big game. This game ends with a huge cliff hanger and will leaving you wanting more, but it is totally worth it."
2823,4,"Just beat the game and this is a little different from Dead Rising 2/Off the Record. I love Dead Rising 2 specifically Off the Record. The zombies in this game really grab you unlike DR2. Also, the survivors are extremely hard to save because the zombies 'trap' and surround them a lot. For those who never played this game, understand that it uses a lot of dark humor and you can't save the game whenever you want so save often! It's a simple game that's very challenging. If you want to beat the game easily, you need to get the shotgun. You will need to get a katana first to beat the boss guarding the shotguns. He's easy. Just use a katana and slice him continuously behind the bench. He will throw you but slicing him behind the counter prevents you from getting hit by his shotgun for some strange reason. To level up, you need to save survivors who are really bad at avoiding zombies so you will need to help out quite often unlike DR2. The controls in the game prevent me from giving it 5 stars like DR2. The controls are bad and really complicated. Glad they fixed it in 2. I recommend going to options and changing the AIM to 'Camera Angle' instead of 'Player Angle.' This will help a lot. If you want challenging, simple, and fun, this and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is it"
2824,4,"I've been dying to get my hands on this game for a long time and jumped when I saw Amazon had it. Just as I expected its similar to the Munchables on the wii.

Gameplay: When you start the game you are placed in a training level that allows you to get used to the controls and using the Katamari. Trust me you'll need it. It took me awhile to get used to controlling the Katamari and even though i finished the game it still fills a bit akward at times. You move by tilting both anologue sticks in the same direction. The anologue sticks are gonna be used for just about everything and will take time to get used to. It can get annoying becaise as the Katamari gets bigger it gets harder to control depending on the Princes stamina. Running into objects you can't pick up causes you to loose items. The quick turn will become your best friend for levels where there are tons of huge objects. Another thing that annoyed me is when I got big I ended up getting stuck in narrow spots making navigation a b**** expecially in the city levels. After awhile I learned how to avoid these problems. It does take time to get used and some level of skills. Once used to it the controls became pretty simple.

Story: The story of the game basically goes like this. You play as the Prince who is sent to earth to roll up objects in a speare like object called a Katamari. You're doing this because your father, the king of the cosmos, accidently destroyed them all (the prickXD). The big ball of objects you pick up will becaome either Stardust, a Star, or even a constellation. You're given a time limit in just about every level to pick up as many objects as you can or as many of a particular object. Its pretty straight foward. The levels I had the most trouble with, and I'm happy theres only two of them, are the Ursa Mijor and Tarus levels. I hate these levels with a passionXD You have to pick up just one of a particular object and more times than none you'll get a big katamari and end up picking up a small bull or bear making all your hard work for nothing>.< You get the best score if you pick a huge version of the object, but the world is scatter with them of different sizes. If you pick up one you don't want by accident it automatically ends. That is a pain in ass.

Graphics: The graphics are nothing special, but thier not bad either. Everything in the game look like toys. I wouldn't say legos, but some type of toys similar to legos. I actually enjoyed checking out the scenario. I never played anything that looked the way this game looks.

Music: Whoever made this games music is evilXD If you play this game prepare to hear these tracks in your sleep! I found myself relaxed and humming to the jazzy tunes it played! I don't know japenese, but it didn't stop me from trying to sing along to the musicXD

Length: The game is really, really short. You could finish it within a few hours, but theres alot of replayability if you want to find all the presents, objects, make the biggest star you can, and unlock other things. Theres also a two player mode, but i can't say much about it because I currently have noone to play it with (I'm the last child in the houseXD).

It has its flaws, but Katamari Damacy is a really addicting and fun game once you get into it. Thier were even moments where I laughed because there are some amusing objects and peaple in the game you collect. the King himself served as some good comic relief too. I just wish it was longer. Its not for hardcore players but its good if you just want to sit back and casually play a game like me. I highly recommend it."
2825,4,"Picked this up real cheap from Amazon. Great game (VERY GRAPHIC) with a cool cinematic use of the black and white with red. Reminiscent of Sin City in that way. Its the typical attitude of Duke Nukem or the lead Wolfenstein character. Gruff, unforgiving but the 'good guy'. Gets a little repetitive and more environmental traps would have been cool. Camera at times is annoying but by no means ruins the game. Boss battles are easy but fun. Overall game is quick to plow through hence why NOW at this price its awesome."
2826,4,"The first Grand Theft Auto was great. London mission pack is simply just that, a mission pack. It does not feature any real innovation. However, the classic GTA gameplay is still quite a bit of fun. Joyriding is great, and it can seriously eat up hours upon hours of your time. The missions are even more excting this time, as well as violent. So what is wrong with the game? Nothing really, it is just that driving on the oppostie side of the road and hearing everyone talk in a british accent gets annoying."
2827,4,"BlazBlue Continuum Shift II is a solid fighting game, but it lacks in the refine touch that is Street Fighter series has."
2828,4,"Played both the first and second Mario Galaxy games. Mario galaxy 2 is slightly better but not by much since both are very similar. Mario galaxy 2 has slightly better graphics and a more creative style of play with the addition of Yoshi. Graphics look great and the music is excellent.

The biggest issues with the game I have are the controls, which are hit and miss at times. Sometimes they seem to have a mind of their own and it can drive the anger level up quick. Also the camera angles can make you disoriented and confused often. All the crazy worlds and angle shifts can give you a headache.

No game is perfect, but this game is close. I still however prefer Mario Bros Wii over this game. I find that game a bit more creative and engaging."
2829,4,nice
2830,4,"Welcome to 18th century England where Lord Palethorn has found part of an ancient book of sorcery (which should look kinda familiar) and basically manages to repopulate the world with zombies and other critters as he does the ""go off and rule the world"" thing.
Sir Dan wakes up in a museum with only his own detachable arm as a weapon (to start off with, he finds a sword PDQ) and goes off to fight evil, finding some interesting characters, weapons and puzzles along the way!
This game has some cool elements, like being to pop your head off, stick it on a crawling hand, and basically run around like ""Thing"" from the Adam's Family. It also has a neat storyline and, of course, hacking and slashing is always a blast...
The play control needed a little help, however.
The camera angles kinda drive you nuts, and life is hard to come by! Some of the bosses are a little hard to kill, and when you go to the next level, your little, battered life-meter is really frustrating as you get wasted by EVERYTHING. Sometimes it's best to make sure you save between levels... them beat the level your on again with fewer accidents.
Also, if you make too many misjumps (which is easy to do), every one costs you an entire bar of life... the green smoke only provides about 200 points of recovery... then it goes bye-bye. If you make a lot of mistakes in a certain area, you'll pay for it later!
Cool game, had a lot of fun with it, looking forward to Midieval III should they decide to make one(Sir Dan in the future with a light-saber or something might be kinda cool!), I just hope they make the camera angles friendlier!"
2831,4,"A smart and repetitive fighting game that will have you wondering why you haven't played this game yet. A unique set of controls will have you in a trance while you stomp, pile-drive, snap-arms, and run up walls flipping backwards to kick someone in the face."
2832,4,"I felt that most of the reviews on this one was on the money til I played it all the way in Single or Solo mode, which I am a fan of...Multi-Player is something that I will in the future try.... maybe...think old coot....ok boomer....anyway...
  First off the ""on a rail"" feel of game play at first threw me off and I was thinking, ok they are running me down those paths and I have no tactical say so, but then it became apparent that the frenzy and frantic feel it had was actually more akin to real combat, where you really do not have much time to ponder your moves and plan accordingly...i.e. take cover make your shots count....yada yada..
  Then I came across the sequence that you drive a tank...and after a few tries it came to me that this is a whole new feel on what it is to operate a vehicle...I found myself saying ''well I'll be d--ed''...it actually felt like the way it should feel...the most natural movement in a game like this that I have ever felt....you want the tank to go right? just slide the mouse in that direction...spin the turrent? same thing just use the mouse...left click shoot the main gun right click fire the flame thrower....all you use on the keyboard is W and S, the usual, for Forward and Reverse....hold down W and slide the mouse to the right and the tank starts going right..stuck? hit S and slide the mouse the way you want to back up...in other words you are the machine...like it would be if you were the player/shooter...the turrent is your head on a swivel but yet if you use it slowly it is the tracks for the direction you wish to go....man oh man in a few moments there I was navigating through enemy territory taking out all before me...This my fellow gamers is the way it should be...a real joy instead of worrying if you are going to fly off the road or crash in flight like all the others only using W S A D as NAV aides.
  Lastly this one covers the Call of Duty take on WWII that the earlier versions by passed...Stalingrad...South Pacific....so if you are a fan and if you are a big fan of singleplayer you owe it to yourself to add this one to your WWII library...its right in there with my Medal of Honor collection...and fellow gamers of this genre.. I'm stil trying to come to grips with Hidden&Dangerous2 with its UK keyboard movements...to me it's almost unplayable..the key strokes are all over the place...
Sam~
  So in all fairness, this game really should get the credit it deserves and true fans of first person singleplayer games owe it to themself to atleast give it a look see and the price now makes it feasible...and although it isn't up there with CoD 4 let's say in the Pantheon, it really does stand on its own two legs as a welcome addition to the very enjoyable series."
2833,4,"This game is very addictive, a quality that isn't new in the harvest moon series. If you are a fan of the series, this is definetly a necessary addition to your collection. The graphics and the concept of age has bade this game very interesting but theres a few faults i find in it.
Unlike other harvest moons, one seed covers one square instead of 9. Not a major complaint of mine but this makes growing crops not a major part of your income.
There are no festivals. Or well, nothing special. You may walk to gustafas hut or the bar and run into a little cut event. but your not excited that you showed up there. It just seems like an annoying extra minute of your time. Festivals kept the game from getting boring.
Theres several glitches in the game. such as taking the cat out of romanas mansion. and every once in a while in ch. 2, if you leave with your son, he might get stuck and you'll have to wait till 9pm for your wife to go out and rid the glitch if it happens.
you have to breed cows to get it to produce milk. and then only for 40 days, then you must breed again. XP annoying after the first year and you don't understand why your cow won't give you milk.
BUT theres alot of good things about this game.
-YOU GET OLD! for once im excited about becoming old, grey with a hunchback and dying... It lets you end the worry of why noone ages in the other series after playing for 5 years...
-days are longer and months are shorter. some may not like that, but you'll be thankful for it after playing.
-you get a child..and your child ages.. need i say more?
-theres more of a 'realism' to the game that other games don't have. such as the breeding of animals, etc.
- graphics are awesome.
-love growing trees LOVE the trees
-massive seed hybridization thing...havent figured it all out myself though
Anyhow, in all though, the game is definetly worth it. theres alot new to discover and if your a fan of the harvest moon games, get this. you'll love seeing your character with grey hair.. or your kid become as old as you were when you started the game."
2834,4,Works well. Kid loves it
2835,4,"Very fun to have an AI that you train to be better, and once they get to a certain level where they start beating you you almost feel proud like ""My pupil has learned and surpassed the master, go on to do great things my child!"""
2836,4,This is very addictive game.
2837,4,"If you played MGS2, you probably remember the cinematics popping up every few minutes. While this was a bit annoying, the actual game was fun to play. MGS3 doesn't fix this at all. Hideo Kojima should of learned from MGS2, but he didn't.

Basically, you are in the jungle. Unlike previous Metal Gears, you don't hide behind crates. Instead, you camo yourself with the environment. This is easy to do and doesn't take long at all. Throughout the game you pick up more camos, and there are secret ones. There isn't any radar, but this is a good thing. You are now forced to use your motion detector and heartbeat sensor. You also have to look in first person constantly because the camera is practically always above you, and it is a little too close. Another stealth tactic you will learn to love is CQC. Walk up to an enemy and hold the ""O"" button. Snake will grab the person. At first this is strange because you must keep holding ""O"" or else the guy will push you and run away. If you hold ""O"" too hard you will cut his neck and kill him. Once you master holding, CQC is a blessing. You can interrogate enemies, flip them, use them as shields, snap their necks, and trip them. You can also throw your enemies to the ground then make them freeze.

If you don't like stealth, this is a good action game. There are shotguns, heavy machine guns, revolvers, and even a combat knife.

The story is not as far-fetched as MGS2. MGS2 had a crazy story, but at least you could enjoy it. It was so stupid that you kind of found it amusing. MGS3 has a weak story that has been done too many times before. The only redeeming quality of this game is Snake and Revolver. You meet Revolver at the start of the game, and he remains interesting throughout it.

The last thing to talk about is food. There are so many different foods. I've read guides online describing hidden animals and such. Snake responds to food differently, and he can call Para-Medic to teach him about anything.

Although it has a lot of cinematics and uninspired bosses, this game is good. Somehow, it manages to keep me playing. The game has some touching moments and some cool ones. It also provides in the most interesting sniper fight you will ever see in a video game. If you played the originals, pick this one up."
2838,4,"Caution, addictive!!"
2839,4,"I have been playing FPS games for well over 10 years now.  I have played RPG games as well, but to a much lesser extent.

Borderlands is certainly a fun and highly addictive game, but with a caveat.  I think it works best when you play with someone else. (I'll explain more below). The game is a shooter at heart - you have entertaining and ever-evolving weapons that you acquire as dropped ""loot.""  For the non RPG gamers out there, loot is the fun stuff that killed enemies drop and that you gather from found enemy chests and lockers.  For the most part, you go from place to place and shoot various types of enemies.  This is straight running and gunning.

The RPG elements comes into play because you have some limited abilities to customize your character.  You can choose from 4 different classes, which basically define what ""special ability"" you will have.  You can be a sniper, a soldier, a brawler, or a female character that can become invisible for short periods of time.  The chosen class gives you a special ability like deploying turrets, sending out a hunting bird, going invisible, etc.  The class also defines what class of weapon you can specialize in that will deal additional damage.  For instance, the soldier can add damage to shotguns and assault weapons, while the sniper (AKA Hunter) can add more damage to sniper rifles and pistols.  But at the end of the day, all can shoot and use all weapons.  Now, a true RPG game has an in depth story.  Borderlands does not, not at all.  The basic story involves you are on a Road Warrior type planet hunting for alien artifacts.  That's about it.  If you really want a story, this is not your game.

That said, it is still a fun game.  I think it is best played with a partner because the environment is pretty desolate and barren, and without an engaging story, I think it would be a bit dull to play this through alone.  I am playing it coop, split screen, with my son off a single x-box and having a great time.  I applaud the developer for including the split screen option.  It was brilliant.

The graphics are ""cell shaded,"" meaning it looks like a comic book.  I almost didn't buy it for this reason alone, but it actually works with this game and looks great.  The game has a sense of cool style - I recommend it fully."
2840,4,I have the N52 gamepad and this is not as good. The toggle on it is very touchy to drive vehicles and fly aircraft. I really like the way it lights up since I play in total darkness most of the time and also the selector switch at the top left comes in handy to switch profiles on the fly. If you don't mind not having a lighted keypad and being able to switch profiles on the fly then this gamepad is for you!
2841,4,"Pretty good FPS. A bit simple, but the time mechanics are very interesting. If you're not expecting some award winning GOTY game, then you should check this out."
2842,4,"This case is nice and sturdy, but it's hard to zip shut shut when you have the charger in it"
2843,4,"I really enjoyed the story. While the genre of man against machine is nothing new, the game came up with unsettling ways to bring a breath of fresh air into the mix. Combat mechanics are also nothing new, just a tried and true method but still fun. This game never lets up and barely gives room to breath before something else happens.

Where the game falls flat:
The dialog is kinda cringe worthy. To me there are too many ""bro moments"". It's not terrible but it's something everyone has seen dozens of time from over the top testosterone filled films. The story paired with the bad dialog is a weird mismatch. Kinda got the feeling they weren't sure what kind of game they were actually trying to make.

Never the less, it was a heap of fun."
2844,4,it's blathers the owl in amiibo form. there's not much else that needs to be said. works fine with animal crossing amiibo festival.
2845,4,"This game really shows off the capability of the Gamecube.  Reflections in mirrors, see-through ghosts, and more.  The levels are intricate and involved but easy enough for the younger crowd to handle.  My 8 year old loves the fun of trying to find and vacuum the ghosts up!!  I got addicted real quick.  The only down side personally was that I completed the game relatively quickly.  It takes me awhile to finish games but I had this one licked in no time.  My son is still working on his game, though.  A great game but there are better for the Gamecube!!"
2846,4,"I know making the decision to buy a PS Vita is a tough one mainly because of the memory card prices but this bundle made me finally buy one. After playing around with the device for a day I am truly impressed by the beauty of this device. I've played the Walking Dead game on the PS3 with an LCD TV before but the PS Vita's OLED screen makes the game so much more fluid and breathtaking. The games you get are all in the forms of game vouchers, The Walking Dead game will be included in the box and the other 3 games will be sent via email once your Vita has been shipped.

Pros:
- The OLED screen is magnificent
- The bundle includes The Walking Dead Season 1 with 400 days, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time, and Retro City Rampage.
- You do get a 4gb memory card

Cons:
- Retro City Rampage= 40.6 MB, Uncharted= 3.2 GB, Sly Cooper= 3.27 GB, and TWD= 2.2 GB. This means in order to play all your games you will need to buy another memory card.
- The size of the Vita is not very pocket friendly."
2847,4,"I'm up to level 11, but still get killed at least 5 times per session.
Always something new trying to kill my character."
2848,4,"Arkham Knight builds on the other Rocksteady Batman games and completes the Batman series.  In Arkham Knight, Gotham City faces two main villains, the Arkham Knight, who has amassed an army of mercenaries in combat armor and drone technology; and the Scarecrow who threatens to envelop Arkham City in his terror gas.

Concept 10/10
The main appeal is that you get to be Batman once again.  This series has done a great job at capturing what it feels like to be the caped crusader.  The gameplay is divided between exploration, crime scene detection, melee combat, stealth, and the Batmobile.

Story 10/10
The main story is well written and all of the characters are well done.  The cutscenes and missions are well acted and directed.  There's plenty of dark humor, suspense, terror, and excitement.  In the beginning of the game, Batman is exposed to some gas and begins seeing the Joker everywhere he looks.  The Imaginary Joker taunts and ridicules Batman every step of the way.  You'd think you'd want the Joker gone, but the dialogue is so entertaining, I can't imagine Batman without him.  There are some major events that happen in this story and not all of the characters or Gotham city survive unscathed.

Gameplay: 8/10
Exploring Gotham is fun, gliding from tower to tower and finding missions.  It feels great to be Batman and flying through the city is quite fast where you always feel like you're progressing or discovering new Missions.

Crime Scenes are interesting and Batman examines the evidence and puts the clues together.  Then sets off to find the villain.

Melee Combat is a bit faster and more dynamic.  There are also more types of enemies and gadgets that you can employ in the fight.  There is no shortage of enemy types here.

Stealth / Fear Missions, where Batman sneaks around and takes down armed guards is very rewarding.  This is where you get to be the most creative, using your gadgets, tactics, and strategy to take down groups of armed enemies.

Batmobile, this is the weakest link of the game.  At first, you are forced to use it and it is very difficult to control.  It often feels like an out of control Winnebago on ice.  Until you realize you must lay off the gas and press the square button for half a second if you want to make a 90 degree turn, driving the Batmobile is a terrible experience.  It slides off the road far too often.  There are some chase missions, where you battle enemies through the streets.  The Batmobile doesn't control well, so these are the least fun.

The Batmobile also morphs into a tank, and can strafe in all 4 directions.  In these battles, you must take out a small army of tank drones or flying drones.  The tank battles are pretty fun, but not great.  What saves it is that you can see bullet trails of the enemy tanks before they fire, so you have time to dodge.  If you are lined up with an enemy shot, the trail is RED.  If the shot will miss you, it is BLUE.  This makes the shots easy to avoid.  You can also trick the enemy drones into shooting each other, which is satisfying.

The Batmobile is also used in some puzzles.  Unfortunately, there is no creativity in the puzzles.  The gameplay is... go here... no not there... here... now move over one bit... no too far... Ok, there... now press this button... then this button... you did it!  And the game tells you what to do the entire time, so it's more tedious than fun.

Atmosphere 9/10
The art and music really helps bring Gotham to life.  The characters don't look as good as the more recent games like Witcher 3, but it still has a great atmosphere.  The characters are well acted and animate convincingly.

Replay Value: 5/10
There are many challenges and the game is about 20 hours long.  There are two endings.  The ending to the Main Story, and a final 100% complete ending when you finish all of the side quests and find all of the Riddler trophies.  There is a New Game + Option, but no multiplayer modes.

Maturity: Teen
There's comic violence, action, and dark themes.  No gore, swearing, or nudity.

Overall 8.5/10
Without the Batmobile, this would have been higher, but it just wasn't implemented right, and the micromanaging puzzle / story gameplay can feel tedious at times.  Arkham Knight does capture the feeling of being Batman, it delivers a good story, and the action / stealth parts of the game are great.  If you want to be Batman one last time (until the series is rebooted 9 years from now) then you'll enjoy Arkham Knight quite a bit."
2849,4,"Mario, Luigi, Wario, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Toad and Donkey Kong are back for another great racing game. The game is very easy to learn, big assortment of weapons (bananas, ghosts, shells, speed mushrooms, lightning bolts to shrink other racers) to get ahead and clobber other racers. The nicest feature to it, are the courses, because they did not try to recreate the same old courses in the SNES and N64 versions of the game. They took ideas and concepts from Super Mario 2 and made courses from them, such as Shy Guy Ship. The old favorite courses are still in it though, like Bowser's castle and the Haunted House. The backgrounds are intensely detailed, but if you take too long to look at the scenery you might spin out, crash or lose the race. You can compete in one of three difficulty settings, in four circuits which each with five tracks (there is a secret circuit too). The big age downfall is that there are tons of huge corners that drivers must learn different techniques to race around them. Not everyone can master these techniques."
2850,4,"This is a fun game but I would recommend playing it with long distance co op, no offense but the screen sharing and loot sharing are a bit of a hassle, but online multiplayer is very fun. The game is easier than it's computer counterpart and they give you some free loots at the beginning of the game, But I have enjoyed playing it."
2851,4,"I have borrowed ALttP and beaten it before but I bought it for myself. First of all I am a devoted fan of The Legend of Zelda. But this game is a supreme example of Zelda. I have played a few Zelda games. Even the 3Ds. I love them all but in a day dominated by DS games I can't help but still adore this title. Although I will not say this is better than Spirit tracks/ Phantom hourglass outright I believe it carries a different level of fun the the DS titles lack.
  ALttP is a brilliant Classic that is clearly one of the finest examples of a game that ever was created. If you do not have the original than now is a chance to play a game you won't regret. I will worn that new players easily scared by harness might find this almost revolting. Then it would be something to work up to. I was relatively new when I first played it but I used IGN walk throughs to help me. If you think classics are outrageously hard bits of perfect  button pressing then I will say partly. But This is more than that. For one I found the incredible sense of exploration dominant in here. Then there is the villages... etc.
  So what if you already have The SNES ALttP? What does four swords offer? First of you need two+ of these cartridges, two+ gameboys, one+ GB advance link cable and one+buddyies. If you have that consider getting the game. On it's own it is a reasonable game. Fun but with plenty of shortcomings. If you are devoted to playing all the Zelda games that it is ok. If not than I can't promise satisfaction though it still is a winner. Otherwise If you have not bought the original ALttP that it is a wonderful extra!"
2852,4,had a great christmas gift at the.  kid has since moved on from DS games.  The game has been passed down and antoher family is enjoying it.
2853,4,really fun game !
2854,4,"I've played a few Civ games and found this to be an overly scaled down version, but with that said, it's still pretty fun. I'm actually able to get up off of my chair and relax after a game."
2855,4,controllers always seem too expensive for me but this is a Microsoft Xbox 360 genuine controller. Would be 5 stars if the controller was more affordable.
2856,4,"I tried this on a laptop, PC and a friend's Playstation 3. I'm no audiophile, but I thought the sound was very good and easy to adjust bass/treble with the control. I did have to go into the Control Panel and change my setting to use the headset instead of my computer speakers. The friend tried to use the USB with PS3 but that doesn't work. You need the PS3 AV cable--which he doesn't have because he prefers the better quality of HDMI. You can't use these headphones if you're using an HDMI cable--either have or buy an AV cable for Playstation.

One small thing, I thought the sound was perfectly good, but my friend didn't like the ""hum"" when ""nothing was happening"". That ""hum"" is the very very faint sound you get when something audio is plugged in but not being used. Apparently my friend is used to playing video games (on the PC) with a much cheaper headset which just goes dead silent when there are no sounds in the game. This sounds like a personal preference to me, so I pass it along in case it is something that bothers you, too. For me, once I understood what he ws bothered by, I realized I didn't mind that at all--didn't even notice it.

And I liked the control adjustment options on the cord--thought they worked very well. Also, as I say, to me, the sound quality was very good.  Also, I -very much- liked the length of the cable so you can, for example, sit on the couch opposite the TV with the Playstation. Or use it plugged into the computer while you're several feet away on the treadmill. (Also nice, just as with any headset, when someone is watching tv in a room where someone else needs it to be quiet. These blocked the sound very well--also blocked the sound well for the person wearing them).  Overall, I thought they were good."
2857,4,"I gave this 4 stars because I couldn't give it 4.5. i can't really think of any cons to this game. It's fun, entertaining, funny, and all that. Try it out, rent it and I'm sure you'll end up buying it. You get to be homer, bart, lisa, etc. Very fun, needs a 2 player version maybe... Maybe version 2 if there is one will bring that in."
2858,4,"smart humor hard ,solo is hard team with someone very fun storyline good has funny characters I recommend game very fun to play"
2859,4,"Visuals: A+++
- WOOOOOOOOOW!!!
- It's truly a beautiful experience, on my PS4

Gameplay: B+
- Clunky, semi-unintuitive vehicle controls seem more suited to PC setups, as opposed to my PS4 controller.
- The hot-swap between First-person and Third-person is a godsend! I prefer to play in 3rd, personally. But some times, it pays big dividends to have an FPS view.
- Sometimes (due to the incredible detail of the environments) it gets VERY difficult to get a line of sight on enemies, and set-up clean hits.

Multiplayer: A+
- Matchmaking is smooth.
- Frame rate is immaculate, with no stuttering over my 40mbs Internet connection.
- Many different varieties of multiplayer game-style. New variations of ""King of the Hill,"" ""Deathmatch,"" ""Capture the Flag,"" etc. keep things fresh!

Single Player: C-
- A thinly-veiled cluster of Single-player 'Missions' act pretty much independent of one-another.
- No emotional investment in any stakes, aside from near-screen accurate eye-gasm 'Star Wars' recreations and overall spectacle... Yes, I can happily appreciate a well-rendered Forest Moon of Endor without an invest-able story.  :D
- Hopefully the $50 Season Pass might include viable story content."
2860,4,nice for the family
2861,4,Great excerpt the saving system is really annoying
2862,4,"For starters i bought this because i am a 21 year old dork that loves curious george! It ended up being a pretty fun game but just too easy! I beat it like 4 times already and ended up selling it. It does get boring after you beat it but overall the game was fun. It is also great for younger kids. i would recommend this game to anyone who has little ones and just wants a clean, easy, and fun game. Or you just like curious George!"
2863,4,The case that the game arrived in was pretty beat up but the game works just fine without issues. The game itself is fun and is a great party game to get a few laughs out of everyone.
2864,4,"if you like videogame tennis at all you will like this game. It's more of a tennis simulation than an arcade tennis game such as Virtua tennis. They are both fun games, but this game is pretty demanding in order to play it well, which could be off putting if you just want a simple fun easy to learn pickup and play game.

What I liked about this game is the challenge of learning to play it. It has a bit of a learning curve, but it's rewarding.
Add to that the fact that it was really cheap, made it a great buy."
2865,4,"Wanted Fable TLC. Got Fable. Was cheap, and game works. So no real complaint. Other than, you know. Not getting TLC."
2866,4,"Not a bad game considering Ubisoft made an almost totally different version for the Xbox 360.  Granted, the console capabilities were different, but the same ""missions"" and story line should have been employed."
2867,4,"This is a great traveler case, it gives a pretty strong grade of protection to my PSP-3000. The only issue I have with this case, is that it's a little bulky, works great though."
2868,4,"First off, my bona fides: I've been playing computer games for over 30 years; heck, I was designing computer games nearly 30 years ago. I don't even want to think about how many hundreds (if not thousands) of hours I've spent playing various games (mostly 4X and RTS) over the years. You can check out some of my other game reviews here on Amazon (via the link above) to get a sense of my preferences and biases.

I gave SINS four (4) stars overall because it is way above average for the clean, innovative user interface and general quality of the software. It's slick, professional, and absolutely solid. The user interface takes a bit to learn, but once you get the hang of it, it helps you get things done very quickly. And the ability to zoom smoothly from very close to very far out make operating at different scales very easy.

On the other hand, I have a hard time giving the game more than three stars for fun because every game I've played so far (and I've played a lot) ultimately degenerates into shuffling fleets from system to system as your remaining opponent(s) attack. And since ship movement is so slow (yes, even on the 'quick' setting), I find myself spending a lot of time just staring at the screen, watching my fleets inch their way to the current system(s) under attack. Resources (credits, metal, crystal) and 'slots' (logistical and tactical) tend to be so constrained that it's very hard to set up a system that can really defend itself without a decent fleet on hand.

There are no real politics beyond very simple agreements (cease fire, peace treaty, trade agreement, share intelligence). Other (AI) factions make demands of you -- initially for resources, but then for attacks on other factions. You are under a time limit and you have no option to decline gracefully; you either fulfill the demand (and receive a reward comprising some mixture of good will, credits, metal, and/or crystal), or you fail to do so, and you lose goodwill with the faction. Note that you cannot turn around and make those same demands on the AI factions -- an asymmetric disparity that is (IMHO) a serious flaw.

A typical Sins game starts out interestingly enough, but tends to become tedious towards the endgame. Because both movement and construction are so slow, progress in the latter portion of the game tends to be slow as well:

-- Faction A attacks Planet X occupied by Faction B
-- Faction B starts bringing its fleets from elsewhere to Planet X
-- Faction A manages (or not) to wipe out the population on Planet X
-- Faction B manages to bring enough ships to bear to force Faction A to retreat
-- Faction A starts the slow process of building new ships to replace those lost in the attack and then moving them (slowly) to where its fleets are
-- Faction B starts the slow process of recolonizing Planet X (if necesary), after which it can start the slow process of rebuilding the logistical and tactical infrastructure of Planet X, as well as the slow process of building new ships to replace those lost during the battle for Planet X

Or, alternately, Faction B retreats from Planet X, in which case it is Faction A that has the slow process of recolonizing and rebuilding Planet X.

Fleet tactics during battles mostly consist of aiming all your ships at one of your opponent's ships for the 30-60 seconds it takes to destroy it, then repeating that until your opponents flees or is destroyed, or you flee or are destroyed. The variety of technologies that the different capital ships can have are nice, but if you have two or more battles going on simultaneously, it's pretty difficult to do any actual tactics or maneuvering for more than just one battle.

Now imagine that you're doing this simultaneously against 2, 3, or 4 AI factions. It's easy for them to wear you down, but hard for you to make real progress against one of them.

Did I mention the pirates? If you have pirates in the game (some games exclude them), they'll show up out of nowhere and attack your systems also. You can bribe them to go attack other factions.

In the end, it's that combination of simultaneous attacks, slow production, slow movement, and slow progress that pretty much makes Sins very tedious in the endgame. Based on the glowing reviews I've seen here and elsewhere, there must be people who really enjoy that sort of thing and/or have some magic strategies that make all this work.

In sum: great technology, great UI, great initial gameplay, and very tedious endgame. YMMV.  ..bruce.."
2869,4,Yes I like prince of Persia revelation.its a great adventure strategy game.
2870,4,"X Plane is a great flight sim. and these rudder pedals really complete the simulation. They are plastic, but seem heavy enough that if you're not romping on them they should hold up fine. They are definitely heavy enough that they don't seem to tip over or scoot around very much. MAC users-they do work with X Plane 9 on our system."
2871,4,"This is the first 2d donkey kong game i myself have ever played.
I started with Dk64 and thats the only dk game ive played up until this one.

I tried it on co op the day i got the game and oh my god is it brutally unforgiving.
if you still complain about nintendo games being easy well look no further you will be slaughtered in this game.

but in single player it is a little bit easier its not as hectic as 2 players.

very fun game easily recommended and if you only own a wii u then you should have this one by now.

4.5/5"
2872,4,"This game has a ton of issues. The graphics up close are good, but from a distance it looks like its out of a older gen system. The controls are a bit akward but do able. And the night life is cool, with the topless dancers. But the driving is poor. Not that GTA4 is great, but this driving is like the Godfather. Well not that bad, but not good. I am only hoping that Mafia 2 comes out soon, and GTA can finially get a rival. If you don't have GTA and your concidering this, get GTA."
2873,4,"The Gamecube may seem like a little kid's console at first, but after checking out the selection of games and by playing a few myself, I have realized that it is not.
The graphics are nice on every game I've seen so far.  They rival the PS2, though I'm afraid I can't say anything on the XBox, as I don't own it.  Gameplay is very smooth.  There are no ridiculous delays or long load times.  The controller is also quite comfortable, though the analogs are very sensitive.  The Gamecube also has a handle and is small (perfect for vacations!)
The Gamecube also has a variety of games, from Super Smash Bros. to Zelda to Lost Kingdoms.  This definitely isn't just for little kids; I know that little kids normally don't play Resident Evil.  It doesn't have as much variety as the PS2, but there is still a good enough variety to make it worth buying.
Sadly, you can't convert games from previous Nintendos into this one (as usual).  I also haven't found a use for all four control slots (perhaps it is for games I have no interest in).  Still, the Gamecube is a nice console that so fars seems very nice in many areas."
2874,4,Seems sturdy and made of good quality materials. Now if I can only get my son to actually use it instead of leaving his Vita lying around.

2876,4,"If the critics are right, and Nintendo is losing its touch with the hardcore base, then the big-time publisher better be kissing the feet of developer Intelligent Systems.  Despite solid gameplay and lush visuals, Fire Emblem is decidedly very uncharacteristic of the Nintendo of this generation.  No, the light of heart need not apply here - Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is as much about loss and war as it is about knights and mages.  Save for a frustratingly unimmersive storyline, Shadow Dragon forges deep, difficult, and satisfying gameplay and holds up extremely well considering it's a remake of the 20-year-old original Fire Emblem.

Series mainstay Marth stars in Shadow Dragon as the prince of Altea, who must defend his kingdom after the shadow dragon Medeus returns to once again take over the continent.  The game begins with Marth awaiting his father's return, who has gone to battle Medeus with the legendary sword Falchion.  It doesn't take too much foresight to determine what happens next - get used to that feeling, because the story in Shadow Dragon is lacking at best.  Marth moves from mission A to mission B, with a little filler in between but nothing substantial.  No branch paths are ever afforded to the player, and there is little to do in missions that substantially affect the story.  It's disappointing; many tactical RPG's thrive on an excellent story driven by war-time politics and heroic intruige.  It's a remake of a 20 year old game, sure, but you can't help but wish you felt more immersed in the kingdom of Archanea.

The combat is done in a manner similar to Advance Wars for fans of that series - a grid system allows each character in your army (usually in the realm of 15 characters) to move a certain amount of squares each turn, and then engage in turn based combat with the enemy if they are close enough.  Battles are simple enough - a unique rock-paper-scissors combination of weapons keeps things tactical (in this case, it's axes, lances, and swords) and different classes have advantages over others (keep your flying units away from archers!).  It's a solid system that works well - strategy is so key in the early and late game that success feels very satisfying.

In contrast, defeat is a bitter pill to swallow in Fire Emblem.  Fans of the series will be on familiar ground in Shadow Dragon - if a character dies, they die for good.  No resurrections, no undead, no phoenix downs.  They're gone for the rest of the game, and the only way to get them back is to reset your DS and do it over again.  Limited save opportunties make every move a heavy decision and every battle an important one.  It's likely that you'll at least once or twice reset the system to get somebody back, but death here is unavoidable - some of your soldiers will die.  It brings intensity to the gameplay, and weight to the decisions you make.  It's rare that a game makes you think about death, but Shadow Dragon (and Fire Emblem in general) will surprise you.  It's probable that once or twice you will opt to leave behind some of your favorite characters from the game - despite the lacking story, you grow very attached to individuals whom you've commanded for ten or twenty missions.

Permanent deaths are reflective of the game's difficulty in general - strategy is a necessity or you aren't going to make it very far.  The normal difficulty alone will punish newcomers and veterans alike, not to mention the game's five hard modes.  It's refreshing for a lot of core gamers, and genuinely difficult games are growing so rare that you'll probably end up appreciating the game for what it is.  Victory in absolutely every mission comes with both relief and enthusiasm - you reap what you sow, and in Shadow Dragon it's very satisfying.

The missions themselves can grow stagnant after a while, but Intelligent Systems clearly did their best to keep them varied.  Most take place either on a battlefield or inside the walls of a castle with the simple objective to take over a spot on the other side of the map.  Ocassionally, gameplay elements are tweaked or an unexpected variable is added to the mission, which helps keep things fresh and forces the player to think outside the box a bit.  Despite this, mission objectives still feel rather formulaic and ocassionally bland.  Fortunately, the change in terrain and different opposing armies still manage to keep the core gameplay enjoyable.

Fans of RPG's and strategy games will almost certainly find something to like here.  Story junkies might be turned off, but it'd be a shame to ignore a game which does a tactical RPG like it should be done.  Newcomers to the Nintendo platform this generation may end up struggling through the difficult campaign and death mechanics, but those familiar with Nintendo games of old will feel right at home.  If Nintendo has indeed strayed from the path, it's good to know developers like Intelligent Systems are still willing to light the way."
2877,4,"Being the second most eagerly-anticipated game of the year for me (the first was 'Shivering Isles', the third was 'Uncharted: Drake's Fortune'), I assumed it was a sure-fire winner, and the game is clearly one in many areas.

This is such a beautiful game.  Everything looks so detailed, life-like, and fluid.  Motion-animation is so realistic and smooth.  If you squint your eyes little bit, I swear it looks as if you can really touch it.

In terms of gameplay mechanism, this game sets out a new direction and opens up a lot of potentials and possibilities for the future of video game industry.  Everything is simply yet quite complex in execution.  Instead of having single button assigned for each task such as attack, run, and jump, single button is assigned to each hand and one for the legs.  In different situation, the reaction will be different.  In fact, all the game mechanics in this game are pretty much context-based.  It takes a little adjustment period for we are so tuned with the traditional one-button-for-one-task method, but once you get the hang of it, it is very intuitive and exciting way to execute the gameplay.

So with innovative game mechanics and gorgeous graphics, this is a great game?  Unfortunately, that is not the case here.

Huge gameworld where you can freely roam around anywhere anytime (although each area is divided by loading screen) and some interactivity with the environment might have you to believe this is open-ended game like 'Oblivion'.  That couldn't be further from the truth. The game is very restrictive and linear in constrast of what you might have been led to believe.  Linearity itself doesn't necessarily create the problem, but the scope of the stage the game is set and the repetition do.  The world is bustling with tons and tons of people.  But they might as well be animals or objects in this hollow world.  They are just there, period.  Yes, they react when you push them.  You can kill anyone.  But that's it.  No quest given by NPC as in 'Oblivion', no side quest to perform like 'GTA', no dialogue options like 'The Witcher' (you cannot talk to them, period), they are truly monotonous, and this makes the world so distant and hollow.  And all of the assassination mission are exactly identical.  I mean exactly the same.  The only difference is the character you are to eliminate and the cutscene involving the mission.  The only thing non-linear about this whole game is who you are going to kill first and which entry point you are going to take.  That's all, folks!!!  To make the matter worse, it just takes forever to get between one mission and the next without much activities.  You have this huge world, and you have nothing better to do than to walk, run, ride horse, or engage with people in combat.  There is no incentive to traverse and explore or to kill people.  What little storyline and plot twist (if you can call it one) is all marred by this insanely boring and alienating tasks.  There is no sense of urgency or danger.  Especially if you die, the game automatically load fresh start from the automatically saved game.  Sometimes linearity works a lot better and this game is one of them.  It will bring out some sense of structure and intensity sorely missing in the game.

In a nutshell, you are a medieval Spidey jumping from rooftop to rooftop and kill baddies and rescue some helpless citizens from the same baddies.
For a game of this much production value, art direction, innovative game mechanics, and beeeaaaaauuuuutiful graphics, it is really a letdown to see the gameplay makes you really boring.

There are many elements people would love in this game, and the opinion is subjective.  This is by no mean a bad game.  Actually a quite well-made product.  But in the end, what could have been a truly mind-bending, innovative game that combines the stealth action of 'Splinter Cell' and platform action of 'Prince of Persia' (both immensely popular games from 'Ubisoft'), 'Assassin's Creed' feels like a big tease of what is to come in the near future.

(((((PS3 OWNERS)))))

There is no issue with this version of the game.  In fact, better framerate and better graphic overall than 360 except some constrast ratio."
2878,4,"Here is in my opinion the best way to play this game on the Xbox.

WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT THIS GAME

1. Set it to Dynasty. Heisman mode is kind of a waste -- it's funner to control a coaches career.

2. Set it to Heisman difficulty level.  DO NOT mess with the AI sliders.

3. Set it to EAsy Play.  Your runingback will find the holes and your receivers have indicators to tell you which one is open.  You will not always be successful, however.  It isn't that EAsy.

4. Turn the unsportsman like conduct down to about 30% in the penalty section.  You can still get nailed for it, but when you suspect your player is doing something stupid pause the game and unpause it -- no penalty.

5. Use the Auto-Name function in the roster section.  No more ROLB #54 -- they will all have names now except for the really small schools like Maine Black Bears (example only -- you may find differently).  Brad Nessler will actually pronounce the names.

6. In the contoller section you can switch to the 2005 control layout.  There's too much whining about the controls.  If you want last year's, you can have it.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS GAME

1. There's still too many long bombs.

2. It's too easy to block punts.  All you have to do is take one of the men on the far right and scooch him over to the rest of the lineman, but yet not right next to them so he can get around the offensive line.  Then since the defense won't jump offsides you can already have him running in place with your finger near the B button.  When the ball is snapped hit that B button and nail that punter.

3. The soundtrack stinks.  I mean really stinks.  Go to the audio section and change the music to ""bands"".

That's about it."
2879,4,"NiGHTS Into Dreams is a beloved SEGA Saturn classic, and for good reason, as it happens to be an absolute classic. Fans have waited years for a sequel to the game, but NiGHTS Journey of Dreams came out and received a pretty mixed response from ardent NiGHTS fans. Some thought it was good, others thought it was a big diappointment. Me? Personally, I'm mostly part of the former group. Let me explain why.

NiGHTS Journey of Dreams retains the fantastic music, enviroments, and for the most part, gameplay, of NiGHTS Into Dreams. To get the best experience, either opt for the Classic Controller or Wiimote+Nunchuk combo, but just don't use the motion controls, as they're frustrating at best. As NiGHTS, you'll fly through beautiful environments, going through rings, collecting items, etc. The core structure is pretty much identical to that of NiGHTS Into Dreams. It works well and it's fun. Some people have criticized the gameplay segments where you play as either of the two kids, but I didn't find it that bad. It's certainly not as exhilarating as the flying gameplay, but it's not bad at all. NiGHTS Into Dreams also had you controlling either of the two kids at times. Like NiGHTS Into Dreams, the boss fights are excellent in this game and quite imaginative.

The graphics are mostly beautiful. While environments amaze with their attention to detail, the cinematic cutscenes leave quite a bit to be desired and are of low quality. The voice acting is this game's biggest downfall, as it's poorly done and sounds pretty childish.

So I've listed the pros and cons to NiGHTS Journey of Dreams, but the best thing about this game is the music, as it happens to mostly live up to the incredible music in NiGHTS Into Dreams. Just beautiful all around.

Honestly, I don't get the complaining with this game. Is it as good as NiGHTS Into Dreams? Nope, definitely not. However, it still pays pretty good homage to that game and delivers on the core NiGHTS experience. It definitely has some nuisances, like the poor voice acting, but it's forgivable due to the nice gameplay, environments, music, etc."
2880,4,"Final Fantasy 9 is Squaresoft's latest sequel to their long running, extremely popular series of role playing games.  The series returns to it's roots this time around.  No high-tech societies filled with laser guns and flying cars here...just traditional dungeons and dragons medievil weapon battles, ect.  Thankfully, the drawing-spells-from-enemies feature that was in Final Fantasy 8 is replaced with the old style magic points system.  While some of the characters are new and original, others seem like watered down versions of past ones (Kuja is similar to Sephiroth from FF7).  The card game is back also, although it plays a less significant role this time.  The bottom line is, you'll see many features that are new, but you'll also see things that are tired and old...like the names of the summon characters and spells for example (I don't understand why that in every Final Fantasy Square has refused to change them). If you are a long time fan of the series, there's enough here to keep you playing.  In my opinion, Final Fantasy 9 is better than 8, but not quite as good as 7."
2881,4,"This is one of the most fun games that I have played in a long, long time. The story is disjointed, self-referential and self-deprecating. The gameplay is pretty solid with a few quirks but nothing to make me hate it, and a lot to make me really like it. The worst part is the Wii is a little slow when lots of blood is flying, but it never causes any problems with control or makes you miss an enemy that kills you or anything like that. The game ""interface"" is very similar to GTA, but the gameplay is not at all like GTA.

Overall, it's an awesome game, and highly recommend it for anyone who knows what the word ""otaku"" means and has ever wished they had a light-sab...er, beam katana."
2882,4,"Bomberman Online manages to breathe new life into an old formula. I love the new rules and hope they show up elsewhere in the Bomberman series. The online games can be fun when there's no lag, but it feels like this is just too little too late in the life of the Dreamcast. Nonetheless, this is pretty good for one of the last DC games. What can I say? Bomberman Online is, in fact, the bomb. Er, da bomb."
2883,4,"Do not buy a used copy of this game. This is a steam game and the code will say its already been used and will not work and you will not be able to install it on PC.  Now I have a used copy that makes a great coaster :) The ps4 version I own and its a great game, one of the better cod titles once you get used to the smaller TTK of the game. If an opponent gets the drop on you with good aim, you won't have time to retaliate before you die, even if you set max health to 200%.

I can't comment on the pc version versus the console ps4 version since used versions won't install to steam without a code that hasn't already been used."
2884,4,"If you've played through Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance, then you pretty much know what to expect from the third Castlevania for the Gameboy Advance.  The graphics are fantastic and the sound has been much improved over the blips and bleeps of the last installment (HOD).  Konami has really come close to perfection in its game design- the layout of the castle was obviously very well thought out, and there's hardly any backtracking or aimless wandering like the last 2 castlevanias.
My only gripe, and it is a substantial one, is that the game in its entirety can be completed in under 8 hours.  True, there's a hard mode that opens up after you beat the game once, and there's a second character that you can use, but these don't exactly justify the game's extremely short length.  If you haven't played any of the past Castlevanias, this may be the best one to start with, as it is by far the most polished; there's just not much overall quantity."
2885,4,"Hoo boy...
Where to start?

How about a trip down memory lane? The year is 1987, and four years ago, two events tremendously and irrevocably changed the course of the video games industry. The first was the release of Nintendo's Famicom console in Japan, the beginning of the video gaming industry as we know it today. The second event was the near-total collapse of the North American video game sector, which, in the grand American tradition of bursting bubbles, was entirely its own fault. With American game companies fleeing the toxic money sinkhole they helped create, the geographical axis of the video game world moved deep within Japanese territory. The Famicom presented Japanese software outfits with the double opportunity of a fertile market and a level playing field.

The first wave of third-party games were ports of arcade and MSX titles, while the first games developed exclusively for the Famicom started arriving towards the middle of 1986. Very few of these initial efforts were very noteworthy (or even that good), but for a few exceptions. Among these is the iconoclastic Dragon Quest, the third ever Famicom game created by longtime MSX developer Enix.

At the same time, a small game developer and publisher called SquareSoft is floundering. After publishing a string of unsuccessful NES games, the company drifted ever closer to bankruptcy. The company's Director of Planning and Development, a college dropout named Hironobu Sakaguchi, began to work on a new game: a Dragon Quest clone dubbed Final Fantasy. Sakaguchi chose the name knowing that the project would likely be SquareSoft's last game and his own farewell to the video game business. Little did he know his gallows joke would go on to become the longest running oxymoron in video game nomenclature.

In its early years, Square's business strategy consisted almost entirely of stealing other people's ideas. Much of their work was also inferior copies, which goes a long way to explaining why the company was doing so poorly to begin with. However this was the first time that one of their ripoffs was an improvement over the original. Not that this is some marked achievement, mind you. The original Dragon Quest is something like a Ford Model-T of video games: innovative, popular, and tremendously influential, but ultimately almost impossible to enjoy. As far as the earliest installments are concerned, there is really no contest. Final Fantasy is the superior software. It has better music, more items, more spells, more monsters, a richer world, and a more interesting storyline. The four-man crew far eclipses the first two Dragon Quest's one and three man parties. Finally, the improved turn-based battle system makes for a far deeper game, as the player isn't sitting around for hours trading 1 HP blows with a single monster.

Make no mistake: Dragon Quest may have come first and concocted the JRPG, but Final Fantasy made it GOOD.

From a modern perspective, the most striking thing about the original Final Fantasy is likely how little it resembles its sequels. Virtually none of the iconic elements now associated with the franchise are anywhere to be seen. There's no adolescent male protagonist in stylish clothes who come of ages and conquers the forces of evil through the power of friendship. Nor is there a well-meaning but ultimately inept gorgeous female co-star who falls in love with the hero after being rescued by him three or four times. There are no cutscenes. In fact, the party members never even speak, much less carry on five-minute conversations amongst themselves. There are no ultimate spells of destruction with ninety-second animations, nor are there any gimmicky weapons (like gunblades, razor-edged playing cards, beach balls, or eight-foot katanas). All of Final Fantasy's trademark critters are nowhere to be seen. The game also can't boast of a five-year development cycle or an eight-digit budget. This game was released within a year of it's inception, and worked on by a total of seven people.

Certain 8-bit games have proven immune to the passage of time. Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Castlevania, for instance, after six successive console generations and a plethora of sequels, still retain the same appeal as they did back when they were first created. They remain just as playable and fun as they were thirty years ago, and don't need tweaked handheld ports or 3D remakes to hold their own against their new-gen successors.

Final Fantasy I is not one of those games.

After several decades worth of RPG's contributing new ideas to the scene, the original NES Final Fantasy probably feels plain, primitive, and unremarkable to a generation that cut its teeth on the likes of Skyrim and Mass Effect. Many of it's most prominent characteristics-- frequent random battles, long and difficult dungeons, tight inventory caps, and EXP/gold grinds-- have been systematically eliminated from console RPG's throughout the years. It also has a whole laundry list of design flaws (like the absence of automatic target-changing in the event of a prematurely felled foe).

In spite of my own fondness for it, I understand why present-day gamers, including JRPG fans, might not have the interest or patience to sit down with this game for more than a couple of hours. I'm not saying that this game is an unplayable relic, just that it definitely needs to be appreciated in the context of it's time.

It's difficult to look back on this game and see why it was such a success. The original plot is sparse and rudimentary, especially compared to the interactive graphic novels that RPG's of today have turned into. But keep in mind that this game was made during a time when video games' storylines were usually consigned to a few pages in the instruction booklet. Or a few words that scrolled up the screen if you didn't press the start button right away. This game told a story about world-sustaining crystals, lost civilizations, time travel, and supernatural revenge. Pretty much everything in the game has become the essence of JRPG clich, but this was some cutting edge stuff in a 1987 Nintendo game.

A lot of complaints for this game center around the fact that it never focuses on the personalities and inner conflicts of its characters. Instead this game is about the interaction between the player and the game's world. Your party are mute in-game proxies for the player, rather than distinct fictional entities you see later in the series, that you guide through the world and gradually uncover it's secrets. The plot might be basic by today's standards, but one good thing you could say about this is that it means the partition between Final Fantasy I: The Story, and Final Fantasy I: The game is not nearly as wide as it is in today's JRPG's.

In terms of conquering the various enemies you'll meet, this game doesn't give you a whole lot to work with. There is only one single health-restoring potion that's good for about 30 HP, and you can hold up to 99 of them (trust me, it only SOUNDS like a lot). There isn't a great deal of healing magic, and you must choose between expending turns and spell charges on magic that restores a moderate amount of health to one character of a piddling amount to the entire party. You cannot replenish magic charges inside of dungeons, and the only way to revive a character whose HP hits zero is through a couple of spells only the White Mage and promoted Red Mage get access to. The real challenge of this game is finding a way to handle the deluge of battles by stretching your supplies as far as you can while guiding your team through labyrinthine, multi-floored dungeons without maps. This serves to make dungeon treks one of the game's highlights, and not just a series of annoyances that must be slogged through in order to progress to the next cutscene.

Another aspect that really sets this game apart is the atmosphere created by Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack, which consists of some of his best-known work including ""Prelude"", ""Opening Theme"", and ""Victory Fanfare"", whose titles attest to his former job writing background music for TV commercials. Combined with Yoshitaka Amano's surrealist-inspired artwork, it created a surprising (for the time) audiovisual experience that cemented aesthetic as a critical cornerstone of SquareSoft's approach to game design. Yes, contrary to popular belief, this concentration on image didn't begin with Final Fantasy VII or Mr. Nomura.

In fact, this series has always been about image since the very beginning. The signature and top selling point of the entire Final Fantasy franchise has always been this tacit claim that it's just bigger than anything else out there. When it was first released, Final Fantasy was as big as 8-bit video games got. In addition to having a larger world, more monsters, more spells, more items, more characters, and deeper dungeons, it also let players fly around the world on a bleeping AIRSHIP. To my knowledge, this was the only 8-bit game that has the heroes rescue the princess before it even shows you the title screen. In addition to trying to just be fun, Final Fantasy I was one of the earliest games that strove for an epic scope and actually succeeded.

So to answer the original question -- what made Final Fantasy such a runaway hit? Three things: novelty, charm, and good timing.

At the end of the day, Final Fantasy really doesn't stack up to technical achievements like Chrono Trigger, the deep and complex combat system of Grandia, the tremendous scope of Xenosaga, or the character-driven pathos of Valkyrie Profile. But is isn't fair to judge Final Fantasy relative to newer, more advanced games, because in all likelihood none of them would exist without it. If this game had never appeared, the entire JRPG sphere may never have deviated from Dragon Quest and remained a Japanese niche market. Without its impact on the console RPG impact, and thus the rest of the industry-- which was largely positive and progressive, at least at first-- games like Daikatana and Mortal Kombat Mythologies might be renowned today as the move beloved games in the genre simply because we wouldn't know any better.

It's not a perfect game, and despite the periodic graphical overhauls it's only getting clunkier with age, but it's still a straightforward and fun NES RPG that's refreshingly devoid of any of the gimmicks or vapid pizazz that saturate modern-day console RPGs. Anyone who wants to call themselves a gamer owes it to themselves to check it out at least once for it's value as a historical curiosity: these are the humble beginnings of the LEAST humble video game franchise in the world."
2886,4,"wow...this game is truly amazing...pretty much anything you type will come up on the screen and you can use it or discard it.  the puzzles are fun and start out easy and self explanatory and get more complex as the game progresses.  You complete levels by finding the starite or making it appear.  Using your stylus to type in things to help you get to the end of the level to get the starite.  For example in one level you have a doctor, cop, fireman, and a chef.  and you have to type in something they use in there hands.  Whatever you type will appear.  I typed in lemur and there one showed up and i accidentally stepped on him and killed him :(.  There are some drawbacks to the game. Like the tutorial, very long and almost made me turn it off and play something else...i kept thinking...lets get on with it, but finally it does and you can have fun.  Also the controls don't always do what you want them to do.  The game is controlled completely by the stylus so sometimes you will touch something but it doesnt register correctly...the creators should have spent a little more time to work out all teh bugs.  but soon super scribblenauts will be out...i cant wait to see whats gonna happen there.  But for this game if you buy it ull enjoy it and it will make you laugh and challenge you mentally.  I give it 4/5"
2887,4,"Any over-the-ear headset is going to give you a better experience than the headset that comes with the Xbox One. While high on style, the included headset is uncomfortable after an hour of wear.

I have both this Afterglow LVL 3 and the Turtle Beach Recon 50X. Overall I found them to have the same good, not great, audio quality. The Afterglow is more comfortable than the Turtle Beach. The ear pads are softer and the headband has more cushion. I also prefer the Afterglow's microphone. It feels less invasive than the larger, protruding one on the Turtle Beach.

Overall I'd recommend buying this low-cost headset if you enjoy multiplayer gaming. It's reasonably priced and will definitely enhance your experience. As others have mentioned, it does require the newer controllers with a 3.5mm jack."
2888,4,Good
2889,4,Very interesting storyline & fun gameplay.
2890,4,"I play PS3 on projector screen 92"".
This is a great game but pixelation is very clear on big screens.
For screens with sizes less than 55"" will be okay.

Game itself is good."
2891,4,Dated but a fun game.
2892,4,"While the graphics are beautiful and some of the gameplay new, there isn't much here that you haven't already seen.  Some of the levels were quite innovative and fun, yet others were just more of what was in the second game in the series.  While this game is great, the second is vastly superior in quality and originality, and I would recomend you play that first."
2893,4,Great game but I liked Midnight Club 3 a bit better. This one is a bit more realistic but still a great game none-the-less
2894,4,For the price this is definitely a good entry point. No problems so far great quality and responsive seems pretty durable but i do have a light touch so watch out for that if you have heavy hands and mash buttons too hard.
2895,4,"Worms. 2D. Awesomely fun. While maybe not as great as my rose colored vision of the originals, This has enough of a feel to keep me entertained for hours. My kids, 5 and 8, really enjoy it. May not be great at it, but hey they have a few years yet to catch up to me.

Only have a few gripes with it. Customization is kinda crap. Only get to use one item to make your worms look different. The worms you fight in the story don't seem to have that restriction. I also ran into a problem creating custom weapons. If you go through multiple versions and try to save the game, the Wii freezes. I could write this off to my Wii being pulled off the entertainment center a few times. The last thing I had a problem with was the story. Yeah worms fighting and story. Haha. No the main problem was the levels. For the most part they are pretty easy. There are a couple though, while fun, required several restarts. That is where my gripe is. I wish they would of started off easy and worked up to where I needed to keep trying again."
2896,4,"These thumb grip caps for PS4 controllers are soft and have a raised edge and bumps to provide a good grip, especially for older controllers that have lost their texture.  They improve control noticeably.

However, they do increase the height of the sticks, which may be good or bad for comfort depending on the size of player's hands, and occasionally come off."
2897,4,"This is a really fun game. I may nit-pick a little below, but know that I love this game. I am about 20+ hours into it and am still loving it.

Think Fallout 3 but slightly less story-oriented and a whole lot more shooter oriented - this game is a FPS + action-RPG, where the shooting in Fallout 3 was noticeably less FPS. Or think Diablo 2 set in post apocalypse wastelands and as a FPS. The driving controls (heck most of the controls) are like Halo - and since I am not an avid Halo fan they took a while to get used to (I like Halo games but I play the single player game of each of them once and that's it).

Very solid controls. Easy to use inventory system. I'm not a huge fan of games where enemies re-spawn, but I don't think you could do the leveling up of your character as well without the re-span.

I have a 5.1 surround sound system and >to me< the sounds don't also sound like they are pinpointed quite correctly in the speakers -- other games get the sounds placement perfectly so I know exactly where an enemy is, but it seems Borderlands doesn't get it quite as right. Again, maybe I'm crazy.

I KNOW this game would be more fun with 2 or more players but none of my 360 friends have it. So the complaint is not with the game but with my friends.

Do get this game if you like FPS Action-RPG loot collecting games. Especially if you have one or more people to play it with."
2898,4,"I had hoped Rainbow Six 3 would combine the gameplay of Ghost Recon with the graphics of Splinter Cell. While managing to offer solid fun, it unfortunately fails to replicate the main strenghts of either of those titles.
The graphics are far better than Ghost Recon, but despite the much-ballyhooed use of the Splinter Cell engine, come a bit shy of matching that game's visual richness.
There is also not as much interactivity with the environment as in Splinter Cell. Most notably, lamps and lights cannot be shot out. You can empty your M16 clip into a camping lantern on the ground to no effect. Many doors simply have no way to pick them or blast through. There is also no way to jump over or move objects. Therefore, an oil drum in front of an open doorway is enough to block your passage. You can crouch, but you can't lie prone.
One way the game fails to match Ghost Recon is that you are stuck with the same four guys, and can only directly control the main character. It would have been really great to have a roster of soldiers to choose from, the ability to upgrade their skills, and to be able to switch among them in combat.
My last gripe is total lack of split-screen multiplayer. At least a simple co-op mode should have been included.
Unfortunately I don't have Xbox Live.
Those are the main complaints, but there is still lots of good stuf about the game.
First, the game play itself is very smooth and gripping. The controls are well laid-out and the heads-up display and other interfaces are easy to use. The lack of an enemy radar or indicator that shows the position of your foes adds to the realism. It's a pretty alarming experience to be creeping along quietly only to find yourself on the wrong end of a hail of bullets with no clear idea where it is coming from.
I also really like the ability to issue a variety of commands to your squad, as opposed to very general aggressiveness stances as in Ghost Recon. Whether it's ordering them to move to the next corner, throw a frag grenade down a flight of stairs, or breach and clear a room on your order, there is a good set of options to make use of your team members.
There is also a great selection of weapons, including several varieties of submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and grenades, opening up more tactical options (for instance, will you just frag a room, or flashbang it in hopes of taking some bad guys alive, or will you toss a smoker and flip on the thermal goggles and pick the baddies off at will?)
Overall, I'm glad I have Rainbow Six 3 to offer up some squad shooter thrills, but can't help but feeling frustruated that the game missed several opportunities to be the best in its class."
2899,4,"Great game and wonderful graphics -- Storyline, but it's too short.  These games normally take me at a minimum 7 or more hours to complete, but it was so simple in less than 3 hours bam I was done which is why I won't give it a 5 star. A 4 star because of the graphics and storyline. 2 stars for challenging level.  It is priced at $7.00 and change. Worth the price. Anything more it wouldn't be worth it.  It also comes with Vampire Saga which I already own and that game rules and Journey of Hope.  OMG!  What a piece of crap game!!!"
2900,4,"Good for some games... Not so good for others. I have a lot of trouble playing any FPS games with it, but that may just be me.

My other minor gripe is that there's no hidden slot for the USB receiver behind the battery cover like most wireless mice have these days. That would've been a nice feature, but it's not a deal-breaker. Perhaps when Steam gets around to version 2, they'll add that in.

Anyway, I like this controller for platformers and strategy games. In general, I have yet to find any game that I prefer to use this over a good ol' mouse and keyboard, but when I want to play a game from the comfort of my couch, it's excellent. I do really like that I can navigate Windows using this controller as well. It's a little bit clunky, but it works."
2901,4,"A month later and after ever day use, still going strong. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because the triangle, circle, square and x symbols on the 4 buttons to the right have started to rub off. I recommend  this if you buy the core system that comes with only one PS3 controller and you just want a second wired controller as a back up or for 2 player game play."
2902,4,"Factions is the second game in the Guild Wars series.  It can stand alone, like its predecessor (Prophecies).  But it's unlike the first game in many respects.

The most obvious difference is the difficulty.  Prophecies starts out slowly, with an extended tutorial and a slow leveling curve.  You can make it halfway through the story before hitting the maximum level of 20, and it can take quite a few hours to do so, since you'll go through numerous story missions along the way.

Factions has a brief tutorial, which you can choose to skip -- then it drops you into the middle of the action.  You run into higher-level creatures more quickly.  Quests are more difficult, in general.  They also offer greater rewards, both in experience and in gold.

By the time you leave the starting island, you'll have done two story missions.  If you've done other quests on the island, you can easily be somewhere between level 17 and level 20.  And this can take as little as three hours or so.

Aside from that difference and its Asian theme, Factions is more developed in subtler ways, too.  There are two new classes, the assassin and the ritualist.  (These can be taken ""backwards"" to Prophecies, if you own that game, as well as to the subsequent Nightfall or Eye of the North.)  There are different henchmen.  There are different monsters (mostly more difficult ones).  There are different skills to find, many of which are less straightforward than Prophecies skills -- a skill might have an extra effect only in certain circumstances, for instance.  Finding synergies becomes even more important.

The story is surprisingly solid -- a mysterious plague is spreading, and you quickly track the cause to a long-dead traitor, now returned.  It's classic fantasy material, but some of the twists it takes from there are a bit less predictable.

Factions is probably the least forgiving of the three campaigns for new players to start in, but an experienced player will find it the quickest starting point, and there's a lot to like.  The main downside is that the henchmen are no smarter than they were in Prophecies -- the ""hero"" NPCs of Nightfall are far superior."
2903,4,"EDIT to my 1 star review
Have to ignore provided instruction and look up the instructions under previously asked questions
""Does it not work for win 10?"" that's like the top question with the correct answer and it works if you do what it says

-Open device manager (use search bar or hold the Windows key and press X, them M)
-Right click icon for the Unknown device (probably under Other devices) and click 'update driver software'
-click 'Browse my computer for driver software' then 'let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer'
-Scroll all the way to the bottom and click 'Xbox 360 Peripherals' and click next.
-Highlight 'Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows"" and click next. Click yes on the Update Driver Warning message box that appears.
It should install correctly and work from there. Game on!"
2904,4,The AV cables work great and they both look new. The power cord is a lot shorter than the original Xbox power cords. They both work great and you can't complain about them too much for the price. Overall I would recommend this if you are trying to get your Xbox console working again and you don't want to pay a whole lot to do it.
2905,4,"I enjoyed the game, it is a sniper game and pulls it off, i do agree with the other reviews about not being able to pickup enemy weapons that sucked , but all around for the price it was good. plus I got a copy to of Ghost 1 to gift to my nephew so it was cool. Nice graphics and decent test of skills even on casual.seemed pretty realistic ."
2906,4,"I never played Assassin's Creed 1 nor did I want to. Although it got great reviews, there were a fare amount of complaints regarding its repetitive gameplay. I did however want Assassin's Creed 2, but did not want to have to buy AC1 to get the whole story. If you're like me then there's no worries. You can either watch someone else play the whole game on Youtube (walkthrough) or read the whole plot on [...]. Wikipedia is quicker and easier but you miss various plot points, so Youtube is probably better.

The game is fantastic. I won't go into detail as you can read that from other reviews here or from gaming sites ([...]). I will say that this game is FREAKING HUGE! I actually got a little tired 3/4 way through the game, not in a bad way mind you. I just kept expecting it to end soon and this sucker just kept on going. I am always asking myself if a game is worth the price and this one definitely was.

1 con worth mentioning though is that the gameplay (or rather the movements of the character) is rather slow. Don't expect to be plat-forming with Mario like reflexes or killing hordes of guards in seconds, this ain't no Ninja Gaiden.

The story is great though be warned, it  gets a little atheistic. It is however just a game and it is explained via a message at the beginning that the game was ""created by people of various religions, faiths, and beliefs"". If this isn't a deal breaker for you then I strongly recommend this game."
2907,4,"It works, thought sometimes I get a little worried because the light flickers a bit when I am charging my 3DS."
2908,4,"Very fun game loaded with personality, it's just a tiny bit grind heavy but it's easy to do so if you're smart enough to click the mission that gives you 90k."
2909,4,As advertised.
2910,4,ok
2911,4,"Overall this game is a lot of fun. Its graphics are unmatched, its features like 24/7 mode, all-time players and teams, various unlockables, a great create a player and fantastic franchise mode. Having said that there are things in the gameplay that are very frustrating, Most of them take just a little practice to get around like nailing free throws and setting up plays. But besides those there are about 100 things I have to complain about. First and foremost: TOO MANY OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS! Its unbelievable how advanced this game is on some levels than on fundamental levels like rebounding mechanics they are crappy.  I have a team with both Tim Duncan and Ben Wallace, and we give up an average of 15 offensive boards a game. Why? Well for one thing boxing out does NOTHING. Also the computer controlled defenders don't rush to the glass when a shot is put up, most times they just stand there, but even if they do do up for it, or your player that your controlling goes up for the rebound with perfect post position timed perfectly the ball might take an extra bounce or roll off right into the offensive players hands or it'll bounce off of your back for some odd reason or just fall to the court un touched. And even if you do grab it somttimes they'll call for for goaltending. For the most part the rebounding mechanics are a lot like the shotty rebounding mechanics of NBA Live 2002. But offensive rebounds are the just the tip of the iceberg, the next most frustrating thing is the crossover. I don't care who you are playing as, or against, if you crossover you will do either two things: 1) get a charge/offensive foul or get the ball stolen. When it comes to NBA Live and ESPN NBA, Live's ""Freestyle"" had it all over ESPN's ""isomotion"". And other things that are frustrating are that there are too many offensive fouls, too many blocks, and too many turnovers. The gameplay is just plain sloppy."
2912,4,"This is an excellent game, and is much better than Empire Earth II. It's fast-paced and simple: gather resources, build an army, conquer your foes. It comes with several excellent campaigns as well. The game spans all history, so it works for whatever type of player you happen to be. It even goes three epochs into the future. There's a large array of units, buildings, etc. The only cons with this game is that it doesn't have the cultural aspect of say Civilization III. This is a military game. That's why, in the event that all players are allied to one another, the game ends. But overall it is a very good game and an excellent addition to any computer game collection."
2913,4,"I prefer Adobe's PDF format to that crummy CBR app. PDFs are easy (to least for me) to read and set up in my own reading settings, so Spidey's set here is a MARVELous collection that displaces those old short boxes full of comics with an always- pristine collection that is easy to navigate and wonderful fun to re-read.

A ton of discs, though, could've been done on one 8.5 gig DVD. Food for thought for the future.  A lot of CDs are clunky. Still, a terrific way to bring classic comics into the present day! Kudos! Love it!!!"
2914,4,"Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is the best new Mario game I've played in a long time. This time it's a role-playing game, which gives it a twist to the usual Mario game, and they even injected some humor in it which makes it very funny and even more fun to play! Both Mario and Luigi go on the journey together to find Princess Peaches voice, and you can play either one of the bros. at any time during the game. I am addicted to this game and am so glad that I bought it! I can't put it down. This is a must-have for everyone. It's not too hard, either, like I've experienced in the past with other role-playing games and have had to stop playing. Anyone will thoroughly enjoy this one- take my word for it! (This is not a good game for young kids who cannot read, though, since there is a lot of reading involved that is inportant in order to play the game.) Make Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga your next video game buy! Like I always say, you can never go wrong with [buying] Mario. :)"
2915,4,does any of these game developers wonder why call of duty 4 and 5 is so popular?and always holds number 1 on multiplayer?because the realism and pinpoint accuracy of shooting a weapon.killzone 2 is eye candy and an amazing campaign.but the shooting i didn't like. accuracy is aweful the guns shake like your having a seizure when your shooting.makes it extremely difficult to kill enemies.the multiplayer reminded me of resistance 2 so i didn't like it.the call of duty series with multiplayer is real and not complicated you have perfect accuracy and you know where your enemies are are at all times.but i don't want to ruin killzone 2 for everybody it is overall awesome.but the shooting thing just really turned me off.
2916,4,"Sonic & Knuckles(1994). The fourth Sonic game on the Genesis (or 2nd half of the third, if you prefer to call it that).

Once upon a time, Sega became a worthy 16-bit contender in the early 90s thanks to the release of a fast-paced adventure starring everyone's favorite blue hedgehog, Sonic. Then the series really took off in 1992 with the release and success of its sequel. The Sega CD harbored Sonic CD, a worthy cult classic, though for some reason it became forgotten over time. This brings us to ""Hedgehog Day"" of 1994, when Sonic 3 was unleashed on the public. Originally, the game was slated to be one massive adventure, but in order to meet deadlines, Sega decided to cut it in half, give the fans the first part of the game early on, and save the rest of it for a later date in the year. In the meantime, Sega also thought about incorporating a special ""lock-on"" feature to this second half of the 3rd Sonic game which allowed one to stick Sonic 2 and 3 on top of it, and it would change the game to a certain degree. Of course, lock on technology was nothing new (*cough* Game Genie *cough*), but this was the first time that it was incorporated for a specific purpose, more of which I'll get into soon.

So this time, Sonic must traverse the rest of Angel Island after bringing down the Death Egg (again) onto a volcano and stop Dr. Robotnik once and for all. However, Tails is gone for this round in place of being able to play as Knuckles the Echidna for the first time. He taunted and tricked you all throughout Sonic 3, but now you can rip through the stages as him, or get your revenge on him at last with Sonic. Either way, S&K holds up as its own giant adventure, with the same size of levels, graphics engine, powerups, and other features as the previous game. I've covered the basics of the game in my Sonic 3 review, so I'll just go into the new stuff here:

PROS
-LOCKING ONTO THE OLDER GAMES GIVES THEM A NEW FRESH REPLAYABILITY. Stick it onto Sonic 2, and now you're traversing the Casino Nights, Hill Tops, and Wing Fortresses of old as Knuckles given the advantage of his new abilities. However, stick it onto Sonic 3 and you'll get the massive adventure that Sega wanted to release all along - in other words THE BIGGEST AND BEST SONIC GAME EVER CONCEIVED. Play as all three of the furballs going through both games and collecting 14(!) chaos emeralds to become... HYPER SONIC! On top of that, stick it onto Sonic 1 or any other Genesis game and you'll now have access to unlimited random Special Stages styled from Sonic 3.
-KNUCKLES IS A NICE ALTERNATIVE TO PLAY AS FROM THE OTHERS. He doesn't fly like Tails or jump as high as Sonic, but his glide, climbing, and smashy fists enable him to reach places that the others can't get to. Plus, a lot of the areas of certain zones that you traverse are completely different from Sonic's.
-COOL NEW BONUS STAGES. There are two of them now, and are far easier to access as well. One is an energy sphere magnetic place where you have to reach the top, and the other is a combination of Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2 and the Special Stages of Sonic 1.
-EXCELLENT MUSIC HERE! I'd forgotten how awesome S&K's music actually is, and is overall a step up from Sonic 3's. None are bad here and they seem closer to Sonic 2's soundtrack, especially the Flying Battery, Sky Sanctuary, and Death Egg themes.
-THE ZONES ARE VARIED FROM PREVIOUS GAMES. Yes, there is another volcano zone, but now you can explore new areas like the massive tombs of Sandopolis, the flying ruins of Sky Sanctuary, and the inner sanctums of the giant Death Egg ship. Plus now you get to take out the giant Flying Battery ship which attacked you near the beginning of Sonic 3. Strangely, this seems to be the only Sonic game without a water zone, which renders the Bubble shield useless, but oh well. In contrast, you will find more use out of the fire shield though.
-PERHAPS THE BEST FINAL BOSSES OF ANY SONIC GAME. There are a bunch of them to take out near the end, and when you collect all the chaos emeralds, you can go through a special Doomsday Zone as Super Sonic. Plus, Knuckles has more difficult versions and some original bosses of his own to fight, so it never gets boring.

CONS
-Since this is technically the other half of Sonic 3, THERE ISN'T A WHOLE LOT OF NEW STUFF FOR SONIC'S ADVENTURE. Pretty much Sonic has all the same attacks, animations, and powerups as in Sonic 3, and now with Tails gone, his reaching abilities are hindered. His absence is fixed, however, by locking it onto Sonic 3.
-THE SAVE FEATURE FROM SONIC 3 IS SORELY MISSED. With as massive as the levels are, being able to save after Sandopolis Zone Act 2 would be nice, but again, this problem is remedied after locking it onto Sonic 3.
-NO CHANGE OF SPECIAL STAGES HERE. Basically, these new ones are simply styled after the Sonic 3 SS's.

Don't let the 4 stars deter you at all. S&K is certainly one of the most memorable Sonic games of all, and if you liked Sonic 3, then I see no reason for you NOT to like this one. As a whole, Sonic 3 & Knuckles deserves its full 5 stars, so whether you want to find their original carts, or just play them on PC or the new Sonic Mega Collection, find them any way you can because these are some of the best 2D games that defined an age of gaming. GOTTA JUICE!"
2917,4,"Fun gameplay, terrible story..."
2918,4,I really enjoy the game I'm on it every night.. only thing that keeps it from being perfect is unable to fire any weapons.
2919,4,"Another solid headset from Turtle Beach. The Turtle Beach Spectre is the middle tier middle of Call of Duty Ghosts branded headsets. There is the cheaper Shadow version which is wired as well but uses stereo sound and then the more expensive Phantom that is surround sound and wireless (and loaded with additional features).

If you don't really care all that much about branding (Call of Duty skin) then there are a few other options with usually a fifteen to twenty dollar cheaper price. So, first decision is to decide if you want to Call of Duty branding. If you do awesome, you have the three to choose from in the Ghosts line. If not, and you want to save a couple bucks, then you have a plethora of options.

For this one in particular though, it's a good solid headset. Great sound - game sound and chat sound.

it's versatile, in that it can be used for every system out there, including PC, Mac, Vita and other mobile platforms. (Caveat it can be used with the Xbox One although for chat the adapters are not available yet as of the writing of this review)

I knocked a star off of this one because, even though it's very good quality at this price point I'd expect a fully wireless set and the uptic in pricing based solely on the Call of Duty branding isn't really justified in my opinion. Easy to set up and use though."
2920,4,i got this game along with 9 others for the ps3 after selling my xbox 360. after playing it for about 1 hour the first night i was like this sucks its going back to gamestop. after about 15 races i couldn't come in 1st and i bought all the upgrades for my little vw bug. so why the good score you ask ? well let me tell you- i woke up the next day and played kane and lynch and i finnished it but i had and hour before work so i put baja back in i was like ill give it another go so i started by buying a new vw unlimited and let me tell you the difference was surreal. 1st in every race on to the next class again 1st in every race whoo-hoo im starting to like it. i unhooked my ps3 and brought it to work and played baja for over 8 hours straight. it is a good game great no but good. the graphics are subpar the environments are good but background stuff like hotels and rollercoasters are bad also the cars arents so hot. the music is good and it really is like real baja the slightest bump can ruin your race and your ride. while baja is far from perfect if there is a baja 2 it will be great. this is the yang to motorstorms yin.it is more realistic play it to see what i mean.
2921,4,Finally a descent Sonic Game for PS3
2922,4,"There's no way for me to avoid the drug references. How can I? I look at this game and think, ""I've never done LSD, but I feel like I know what it's like"".

If you've played the first game in the series, ""Katamari Damacy"", then you have a fair idea of what to expect with this one. Yes, it's ""second verse, same as the first!""

The plot line is slightly different. In the first game, the King of the Cosmos, your dad, got naughtily drunk and smashed all the stars in the universe. Your job was to roll up enough katamaris to rebuild them.

In this game, you did such a good job rebuilding the universe that the people of the world want you to roll up more. Apparently instead of being terrified at this midget from the skies coming down and rolling up entire landmasses, they are accepting of your odd behavior, and even enjoy your father's strange quips.

And so it's time to make more stars. You roll, and roll, and roll. You roll mice, you roll rocks, you roll cats, you roll snow drifs, you roll gods, you can even roll up the King of the Cosmos! Not too shabby!

There's also a dandy two-player mode, but since I'm insular and don't play well with others, I haven't tried it yet. I could try to play with myself, but, frankly, I'm working in DRUG references here, not any other sort.

The cutscenes are somewhat different in this game. You don't get a young girl saying, ""Oh! I feel it! I feel the cosmos!"", in a way Timothy Leary might approve. No, what you get instead is the unfolding saga of the King of the Cosmos when he was a wee lad. It's pretty cute.

Sound-wise, the sound effects are pretty basic. The music is its own genre, however. It takes the music from the first game and really runs with it.

Ultimately, I highly recomend this game. It's got some flaws, but it's a good game and fun."
2923,4,"Like many games I seem to enjoy, this game is getting a pretty bad rep. I'm reviewing this to clear up some information for the more open-minded of you that are kind of on-the-line as to picking Bodycount up or not. Remember, this post is entirely of my own opinion, & I happen to prefer games that are not always AAA titles.

First things first, Is Bodycount worth it's $60 price tag? Unfortunately, Bodycount is overpriced. This is a game worth no more than $40. The multiplayer is very typical, and I do not think there will be any downloadable content in this games future. I'm (most likely a little more than half way through the game & playing on the hard difficulty setting) working on the campain mode, and while I'm totally enjoying the game, I expect to finish it within an approx. total of 8 hours. (correction, hard mode took me 14 hours to beat)

Is the gameplay enjoyable? Here is the premise: SHRED EVERYTHING IN SITE! If you enjoyed the demo, you're in for more of the same. I absolutely LOVE the the cover/strafe system, the destructable environments, and the weapons are all tuned up to 20! One of the more addictive elements is the fact that there is no load time between deaths, giving it that, ""lemmy just have one more go, I know I can beat it"" vibe. The earlier AI (also in the demo) is completely lacking, but as you progress through the game, new enemies are much smarter, will use cover, and will try to flank. This forces the player to be less ""Rambo"" and more of a tacticle ""John McLaine"". There are small power-ups based on how much intel (blue orbs that spew out of dead npcs) you gather: ""explosive bullets, impervious to bullets, night vision, and an air-strike"". Ultimately, I'm loving every last minute of Bodycount. There are enough reminders to Black, but with more of a cartoony/arcade vibe.

How are the graphics/sound: Graphics are decent, sound (as with Black) is incredible.

Replay Value: This really depends on the person. I find this to be in perfect compliment to Fallout New Vegas (which I'm also currently playing) in the sense that, sometimes I just want to let loose and not take a game so seriously! Another one of my favorite games (also unfortunately bashed by the ""critics"") is Kane & Lynch 2, and I think that Bodycount is going to take the place of it as my new, ""throw the disk in, turn up my custom soundtrack, blastfest.""

In all, besides the price tag, there is really nothing wrong with a game like Bodycount as long as you know what you're getting into. I find it sad that a game as entertaining as this gets raped by critics force-fed on diets of Halo & COD. Like Serious Sam, Doom, & early Red Faction, Bodycount does what it does really well and brings a few new elements to the table. Personally, I'd give the game a solid 8."
2924,4,"Great Product, We own 2 Ps4 and this is s must for us, works grest"
2925,4,"The game is just OK, is very repetitive and the controls are horrible, especially when it comes to turning. The graphics are OK, comparable to NFS Hot Pursuit. There's no story at all, you just jump into a car a start driving. Every car is available from the beginning, you just need to find it in the map and hop into it.
For the price I think is a good choice but maybe you can find it cheaper somewhere else..."
2926,4,"fun game, great price, what else to say?"
2927,4,"DA: Origins is not Bioware's finest production, but it is definitely not it's worst. In Bioware fashion, players are offered a linear storyline with several avenues to choose from. The introduction (first hour of gameplay) is different for each class you choose, which adds a bit of replay value to the game. The lore is fleshed out rather well, although it reminisces of Lord of the Rings in many ways. The gameplay involves minimal user interaction, which takes away from the game to a degree. All in all, though, I highly recommend DA: O to anyone who enjoys Mass Effect, KOTOR or RPGs in general."
2928,4,This is a good game. Brings back memories of Megaman. But why it's $30 here on Amazon perplexes me. It's only $20 on the PS Store.
2929,4,Good!!!
2930,4,"Wii owners, why is it that we are accepting old ported crap while PS3 & 360 owners get new games?

Is it fair to pay $50 for a title or even $40?

If you haven't played these games before, and want to enjoy them as others have in the past, or just want the collection for your Wii system, thats completely fine.

I on the other hand want studios to actually put in some work on the stuff that we are paying $50 bucks on though.
I want King of Fighters 12!
I want Super Street Fighter 4!
I want RE 5, and i'm sure they can make it look better than RE4 on the Wii, because the Wii has more graphics capability.

Every Wii owner might not want the same exact games, but who would argue against getting games for the Wii that have more quality than the low poly remakes and quick buck party games that lack depth?

There is the Wii Classic Controller Pro now, so developers don't have to stick to the Wii-mote. The Wii-speak can be utilized more as well.

Games are going to continue to suck if we continue to accept them being such a poor quality.

Lets demand better: [...]"
2931,4,"This game is hard for newcomers and the learning curve is a bit steep.  The game is NOT and arcade game (think of it as Forza Motorsport with wings, but not as polished).

The two most difficult parts are learning to accurately drop bombs on target and to evade enemy missiles (the latter being the hardest).  To become good you will have to practice, especially with evading missiles, you will just have to get a feel for it (that's the honest truth).

This game rewards you for playing over and over again, you find yourself getting better and better. Once you get the hang of it you will have allot of fun doing the customizable missions. The landings and take-off's are very well done.  Landing on an aircraft carrier is done exceptionally well in this game.

I would set up missions that force me to land mid mission (to re-fuel and re-arm) which I really enjoy.  You can also make the enemies as difficult as you wish. Watching replays of these missions are quite enjoyable.

The only bad thing about this game is the ground graphics up close (they're only nice looking from up in the air), however the actual jet models are really detailed and nice to look at.

I sincerely hope they do a sequel to this game for next gen."
2932,4,It's a good game. Some minor improvements could be made. Hopefully a better net-code. Sagat is too powerful! Hopefully with Super Street Fighter IV they will fix some things.
2933,4,"I am really liking this game. It has a cool style and awesome shooter action and that's what I'm used too. The Mech/Warhawk combat is really mind blowing and I've never played anything like this before, but throw in placement of turrets it has some really awesome tower defense qualities!!! I got this game fore $29.99 and I would have gladly payed $59.99 now that i know what it is but play it with an open mind and your gonna have fun!... Sure is more fun than a dry fps."
2934,4,Decent padding & not overly bulky
2935,4,People complain about Pokemon being the same thing over and over but this game definitely brings new and fun things to the table that I honestly enjoyed.
2936,4,"Civ IV is another great Civ game from the mind of one of greatest game designers of all time. Civ IV presents the Civilization game with such polish and solid gameplay that it will be very interesting to see where Sid Meier's takes the franchise from here.
The graphics aren't the greatest but that's not why you play a Civ game. The mechanics are where this game truly shines. You can conquer by force or by diplomacy and you can be hands-off or you can micro-manage almost every aspect of your cities and territories. The choice is yours.
The scenarios and maps will provide hours upon hours of strategy fun and  you will find yourself saying ""just one more turn"" at 3 a.m. before you know it.
If you like strategy games and you do not own Civ IV, you are doing yourself a disservice. Pick up the game and conquer the world."
2937,4,"I finally decided to order Overlord for the 360 on Amazon for 6 dollars. I wasn't sure what to expect, having never really heard of it prior.

It came, I popped it in and well, I never looked back. I've been playing it almost exclusively for the past 4 days now and I am blown away by how much of a wonderful game this is.

As the game opens you (the overlord) is being woken up from a long slumber by some wicked little gremlins you'll later refer to as ""minions"". These creatures explain some of what happened to you, and start equipping you in Overlord armor, and after some more dialogue and a little training, you begin your quest.

As The Overlord, your goal is to be evil. Now that can mean a little evil, or extremely evil, it's up to you, and your choices throughout the game WILL have an impact on the story.

You control minions of different types, like red minions specialize in fire, for example. All in all there's brown, green, red, and blues you'll be controlling. You can make your minions fight for you, pillage and loot villages, and basically anything else, like opening doors and gates, etc.

In this sense, the game takes on an RTS quality, because you'll have to be strategic with your minions to solve puzzles and beat bosses. At other times though, it's an RPG the likes of Fable.

The graphics don't do a whole lot to show true next-gen visuals, but having said that the graphics are still nice and the world is beautiful to look at.

Now this game, although you play an evil character, is not a DARK game. It's more of a parody of other fantasy games/movies, the biggest example being Lord of The Rings. Your minions, as well as enemies and townsfolk all have incredibly funny lines and do funny things, and yes this game will make you laugh from time to time.

Other times it can be frustrating though. There is NO WORLD MAP, so you'll often get turned around a lot. The controls are also a little sloppy, and it takes a LONG time to get used to them, especially when you have to control seperate minion types at the same time, very quickly.

There's a lot more to be said about Overlord, but trust me when I say it's a FANTASTIC game that deserves to be played, and right now you can grab it for LESS than 10 dollars.

Aside from controls, this is truly a 5 star title."
2938,4,none
2939,4,"I came into this game with no preconceived notions about what it should be. I had never played any of the other Resident Evil games, I had simply played the demo for this game and enjoyed it. That being said, if you play the demo on Xbox Live and like it you will most likely enjoy the full game. It's basically the same thing with a good deal of replay value if you're like me and want to unlock all of the guns and extras in the game. The controls take some getting used to at first, but after a short while you should feel pretty comfortable with them.

All in all RE5 is a solid game that I find to be a lot of fun."
2940,4,"An open sandbox game that does a great job of capturing the swinging and travelling mechanics of everyone's friendly neighborhood Spider-man.  The fighting isn't bad either, and there's a ton of it.  Because of how fast this game moves (yes, even on the Wii though there were frequent slow-down framerate issues and a lot of freezing--that docked it a star) a la ""Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction"" the repetitiveness doesn't get tiring.  Choose side missions or don't, play as the symbiotic black-suited Spidey or in his usual duds (my favorite unlockable suit which I thought looked pretty slick was the silver and black padded assault Spidey suit...I forget what it was called), and bust up tons of different bad guys from thugs in the hood to Vulture-infected symbiotes.

Ample cut scenes, a small but interesting cast of characters (Moon Knight!?! that was cool), a storyline about Venom's alien symbiote spreading like an infection make for a fast and fun game.  Even on the Wii.  4.5 stars."
2941,4,"Allright, I admit It When it comes to Gameplay This Game [loses] But When It Comes To Creating Wrestlers This Game Is Revolutionary. The Create-A-Wrestler Feature On This Game Is So Detailed That You Don't Just Pick The Face, You Pick The Eyes The Nose and The Mouth. You Also Can Put Lettering On Your Clothing, And Have A Wide Variety Of Masks, Face-Paint, And Apparel. With This Game You Could Create The L.O.D., And Even The Insane Clown Posse! The Create-A-Wrestler Mode Is So Detailed This Game Is Worth Playing Just For That. I Only Wish That Modern Wrestling Games With C.A.W. Mode Would Take a Page From This Game."
2942,4,"This game is good, but i am a race game player, and it is  dificult to me to win a single race, imagine a rookie playing this game on first time playing racing games.
the races are good, and the graphics, and the game play, but it is for payers how played  racing games before.

so realistic with the car sounds."
2943,4,"I am not a Tennis fan, but this game its so real that takes you to the incredible world of tennis. So many modes you can play turns this game in a MUST HAVE one."
2944,4,"Batman Arkham Origins is a pretty good addition to the series. I played the whole campaign in about 14 hours, including looking around for items (not all items in this time frame). (I've since put in about 22 hours to get to around 60% completion). If there was any concern with the game going to a new developer, there's really no need to worry about that. The gameplay and setting are almost exactly like Ark. City. There are a few new villains to battle, and new aspects of challenges, etc. The map is larger than the previous games. So there's a cool new fast travel aspect, but it's not easy to unlock every area unless you have the Brady game guide. I can't even complete the one in Burnley do to a glitch in the PC version (hope it's fixed soon).

Cons: It would have been great to have a new main villain as an arch nemesis, but the Joker is back again. There are others in the game, but the Joker is still the main man. He definitely has worn out his welcome in my view. I know they had to have him to lead to the first game, but he could have just showed up in the end.

Although the game is called ""Origins"", there's very little real back-story revealed about anyone that we don't already know. It would have been great to see the decision point for Bruce Wayne to become Batman, but that doesn't happen. Yes, all of the characters are younger & there are a few cool bits. But there's not enough to make this a real prequel.

I also found it more difficult to grapple around the map. The grapple connections are not automatically the highest points as they were in AC. It's particularly a pain when you're just trying to zip around looking for items. You can't even grapple at all at some really big buildings & you have to go clear around. Also, the setting is winter again- it would have been nice to have a sweltering summer or something different.

In the end, I'd say the game is worth playing if you've liked the others. There are definitely enough new things to hold my interest. There are significant side missions & stories. I have not tried the multiplayer.

I'm finding that by the third version, most games are found wanting or feel repetitive. I guess the good thing is that this game sticks to what it is instead of jumping the shark like Assassin's Creed 3/4, etc."
2945,4,"The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-3-40GB-Spider-Man-Movie-Pack/dp/B000XGJH1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 3 40GB Spider-Man Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;is my favorite console compared to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii/dp/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-360-Core-Console-System/dp/B000B43OXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox 360 Core Console System</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-2-Console-Silver/dp/B000TYQL1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 2 Console Silver</a>, and classic Xbox.

I have nowhere near the game titles for the PS3 that I had for any of these other consoles. Reason being, I am uncoordinated with quick hand-eye coordination, so many action games never let me get past an opening level or first challenge.

For someone looking for family fun with a better title selection, I would recommend the Wii EXCEPT for the Wii requires a line-of-sight for the pointing feature of its controller to work (various light sources and obstacles can interfere with this). Another drawback of the Wii is the amount of real space you need to play games on that console. It's fine if you have a fair amount of unobstructed space between you and the TV and are standing fairly centered in relation to the screen. If you are off-center or have a normal living room with coffee table and other furniture around and in front of your TV, this can become a bother.

Wii is poor for couch potatoes. It needs you to stand and swing, swoosh, punch, swash, roll, and so forth. It will exercise you, and if you aren't in good shape you will get winded playing many of its games.

Xbox 360 had a superior software selection from the classic Xbox, and of the two, I recommend the 360. There were some classic Xbox titles I wanted to run on the 360 but couldn't. The 360 quickly became cluttered with accessories plugged into it or placed near it, rivaling the stuff that gathers around most PCs on a desk. I did find graphics and action nice on the 360, but because of what I call ""kluginess,"" I simply wanted that viper's nest of cables, accessories, external drives, etc., to GO.

PS2 has one of my favorite games on it,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-X/dp/B00005TNI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy X</a>. I will miss not being able to re-play this game on the PS3. I see there are a number of guitar, dancing, camera-based, and action games still released for the PS2. I'd say it's not dead, but not really coping with the trend toward HDTV.

It is because of HDTV compatibility, built-in wifi, Blu-Ray movie playback, and a controller that is good for couch potatoes, I find the PS3 to be my very favorite console of all I've owned. Its Blu-Ray playback function alone makes it a bargain compared to current Blu-Ray players (as of the date of this writing). It has online shopping, the ability to download games for PS3 as well as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PSP-2000-Console-Piano-Black/dp/B000UA0LXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PSP 2000 Console - Piano Black</a>. It interfaces with media servers, has a rechargeable wireless controller, a nice online shop with some free content, and a good Internet browser.

There's online avatars, online messaging, online email between consoles, sub accounts with parental controls to restrict network, movie, and game access (by ratings where applicable).

Please note features I mention above are not unique to the PS3. They rival or exceed capabilities of individual consoles I mentioned above. Taken as a whole, the PS3 is more feature-laden than any other.

From actions I've heard Toshiba make recently regarding HD DVD, the withdrawal of Warner Bros. from supporting HD DVD for future movie releases, I expect Blu-Ray is going to be the winner in the format wars. This was my primary reason for buying a PS3, and once I got it home, found it also served my gaming preferences well."
2946,4,This was a gift for my grandson ... and was a gift at his birthday party.  He seems to be having a lot of fun with it.
2947,4,Basically [...] get a game and the expansion that were both originally $30. It's a lot like Diablo only with a Greek Mythology theme. The cinema is good and the environments are much sharper and more detailed then Diablo 2. So if you like hack and slash RPGs then this is a great game to pick up. Also I have a 4-5 year old computer that runs TQ just fine with only a few moments of lag.
2948,4,This game is really fun and is filled with challenges and areas. You can be walking around and an alien pops in front of you. Its hard in a lot of ways. Your in an area with 2000 bullets. Sounds easy. In 5 mins your out of amo with 20 aliens dead and about 60 more ready to kill. I suggest you play the mini games at first to get the hang of the controles. Then begin to fight for your life. When you play it is really dark. So put on different visions to get a better look around. The Predator is really hard for me. I killed about 5 people before I died. I tried to get some cheats but tthey were fake. The alien is kinda stupid because he goes so fast you would run strait past the enimes.(humans and predators) The game is more alien than Predator. But fans of Predator will find the game good for the fact you could be it.
2949,4,"Gets very hot, but seems to work fine."
2950,4,Good!
2951,4,nice
2952,4,"This game is fast-paced and fun, but it falls a little on the generic side.  I also think that it does not have enough gameplay to satisfy.  Overal I would give it a 3.9 out of 5 but I had to round it up."
2953,4,"I love me some oldschool Mega Man action, which is why whenever I look at the Capcom logo now, I just think about the absolutely abysmal announcement back in 2011 that they decided to cancel any plans for a new Mega Man game. Oh, and the struggle to put out a complete Street Fighter game on day one without on-disc DLC, but that's another story. For now, I just know that someone somewhere in Capcom's offices saw Mighty No. 9 headed to consoles and figured they should release something to get people to think they still care about the Blue Bomber. But hey! Mega Man on modern consoles is no skin off our noses I suppose! After all, Mighty No. 9 ironically got delayed yet again, so while we're at it, we may as well have a dose of oldschool action to fuel the fire.

Mega Man Legacy Collection is a compilation by Digital Eclipse and Capcom that features all of Mega Man's NES entries. Unlike most sequel-induced games from the 8-Bit era, the Mega Man series is very consistent with its type of gameplay and graphic/sound style. You play as the titular character, you play through stages hosted by eight Robot Masters in any order you wish, and you get your bolts ROCKED as you struggle fighting the immense Nintendo Hard difficulty the series is proudly known for! And have fun doing it along the way!

While the series often boasts the ability to use enemy bosses's powers against others for a Rock-Paper-Scissors effect, each level in the game is filled to the brim with unique designs, eye-catching graphics, and a fiendishly catchy soundtrack (That is until 5 and 6 kinda made the songs more...mellow?) The enemies may have it out for Mega Man, but there is an impressive variety of them and their attacks, and as can be expected, they help conjure some of the more clever bits of design choices within the stages. All in all, each of these games withstood the test of time and is a blast to play no matter what system they are on.

So is there anything wrong with this release? Well...On the surface, six classic games sounds like plenty to enjoy, and it is...But there have also been plenty of better opportunities by this point. The biggest problem I have with this collection, oddly enough, is that it is called ""Mega Man LEGACY Collection"". For such an impact of a word choice, I was hoping that the compilation could build upon what Mega Man Anniversary Collection (released a whopping two Playstations ago) featured. That one had all eight main series Mega Man games (at the time), plus two unlockable arcade games that prior to then were never available outside Japan. Here, you just have Mega Mans 1 through 6, very oddly ditching the four other sequels. Sure, there is a challenge mode featuring missions reminiscent of what titles like NES Remix would offer, but in a day and age where Rare Replay is a thing and a Mega Man collection doesn't even provide as much as a similar title from 2004, something feels a bit off. And while I don't expect Mega Mans 7 & 8 to show up on the Nintendo 3DS version, the Game Boy Mega Man games could have made for fantastic substitutes.

So really, it all boils down to a simple questionnaire:
1) Do you own a Playstation 2, Gamecube, Wii, or Xbox?
2) If not, are you considering grabbing one of them?
If your answer is yes to either one of those, then you're better off picking up Mega Man Anniversary Collection instead. However, if you only own a modern console (or also in the 3DS game's case, want to play these games on the go), then Mega Man Legacy Collection will at least still provide excellent platform-shooting action that hails from one of the most fondly remembered eras of video game history."
2954,4,"A Roman city-building sim in the vein of such classics as the Caesar series, Grand Ages: Rome has an intriguing premise and workable gameplay, but falls short in other areas.

Grand Ages is a game where you build an ancient Roman city and must keep it operational and successful against adversities and invaders. Providing citizens with food, entertainment, and religious fulfillment are as important as keeping your resources in order. Unlike Caesar, which relied on a road-based infrastructure (everyone has to walk on roads, things travel to and from buildings), Grand Ages uses areas of effect. In short, each building has a circle around it showing the buildings that it will influence. For example, if you put down an apartment complex, the inhabitants of that apartment will only staff a building within the circle. A food storehouse will only feed people within its area of effect, and so on. Some buildings produce global resources that are added to an overall stockpile that are then used by other buildings. A brickmaker produces 20 bricks, while the average house uses up one unit of bricks. Therefore, based on upkeep and the expanding size of your city, you have to maintain a balance between population and facilities.

The problem with these areas-of-effect is that it's remarkably easy, given their shape, for buildings to get stuck with partial coverage. The fact that you can only build a short distance away from your current settlement prevents you from pre-planning where you'll need entertainment buildings or temples before you start building houses - and the effects of not having entertainment are immediate once those houses are plopped down, as the many riots my cities went through can attest to. In fact, the development of the city is often the biggest hindrance to the city. The nature of the areas-of-effect encourages growth (by spreading resources around the map) but also demands close-in urbanization (by requiring you to cluster your houses around facilities). Because of the fact that you can only build near your established buildings, it's often the case that you have to stretch out your town to get in a position to reach the very resources you need to build your town up in the first place. It's not a bad system, per se, it's just frustrating at times.

The combat in the game is simple but effective.  There are many units available - regular units like archers, cavalry, and infantry, as well as a wide variety of mercenaries. The middle class - the Equites - provides your regular soldiers, and when properly supplied with weapons and armor can be called into action. Mercenaries are hired for money and for certain other requirements (such as wine and entertainment). All units consist of roughly 30 soldiers. Units can gain experience through fighting, and can train when not engaged in combat to level themselves up. Some maps have barbarian villages spread around; subduing these (simply by engaging the guards they send out, then walking in once they're all dead) rewards you with additional resources provided by the conquered villagers. In addition to offense, you can also build walls and towers to defend your city from attack.

One of the game's main features is that your profiles are represented by characters. A character is a member of one of five families, each with different strengths (one family is better with military matters, one is better with mercantile affairs, and so on). By completing campaign missions and bonus objectives, you unlock new abilities and bonuses that affect all the games you play with that characters - campaign, free build, or multiplayer. For this reason, it feels that the entire game is interconnected - there's no way to just play. Even the free build mode, rather than providing you with open maps and settings, is only about 15 maps with predetermined start locations and resources. This means that it's difficult to just jump into the action and make a nice city.

The game's graphics are very good; the cities look beautiful, with paved stones and detailed buildings. Citizens walk around the city to their jobs, and always look busy if you ever care to zoom in and examine them. If it rains, citizens will cover their heads and run indoors. There are a lot of little touches that make it really feel like a city. The ability to put down plazas and fountains is nice in visual terms even though these things are also required for game reasons. There isn't a lot of sound, per se, but the music in each region varies and is generally nice without being distracting.

Overall, Grand Ages: Rome is a good game, but the biggest problem with it is the lack of free-play. Everything seems too objective based, and there's no way to really make your own fun. Once you've gone through the missions, there's not a whole lot to do. If the Free Build mode had been more free-form, it would've been much better. Until you run out of missions, though, it's still a fun game.

Rating: 7/10."
2955,4,"Finally, a Doom game that gets the spirit of the original.  I wasn't thrilled with Doom 3 and had almost given up on the franchise.  Doom 3 was too cramped and slow moving.  The lack of lighting and forcing the player to rely on their flashlight got old quick.  The developers tried a little too hard to scare their audience in Doom 3 which misses the point.
This game puts you in a different frame of mind.  Instead of making you the victim who is just trying to survive they make you a pissed off marine with much butt to kick.  You move MUCH faster, can jump up and climb on top of things now (reminds me of HALO 5) and the combat takes place in better lit areas with more room to move.  THANK GOODNESS!
By the way... for those of us with a nostalgic fondness for the original Doom there are secret areas on every level which open up into an area made to look like the original Doom.  The only difference is the enemies are still the modern ones but still, it was a trip down memory lane when I opened my first classic Doom area.  Look closely for levers that you can pull as you are progressing through each level."
2956,4,"OK, as you might guess from my Amazon screen name, I like to play games. I play primarily PC games, and within that genre, I primarily play shooters although I like to mix it up with a good action RPG every so often (Witcher 2, Skyrim). Because I am a bit older than your average gamer, I have played an awful lot of shooters. I played the first Far Cry back in the day and loved it. It was truly open world, with intelligent AI. I salivated at the thought of Far Cry 2, and wept in disappointment because I thought it was just so bad. So, when I read about Far Cry 3 last year, I sort of went ""meh."" It sounded exactly like the Far Cry I played 10 years ago, and besides, the last one sucked. So I decided against getting it.

Then, I ran out of games and Amazon had a great sale. I picked this up for under $20. I figured it was an acceptable risk in case it was a poor game, or just a rehash of the original. Glad I was wrong in my expectations - this game is really, really good. I thought for sure I would detest the hunting side games, which are necessary to increase the size of your weapon holsters (so you can carry up to 4 weapons), and I thought the game would quickly get tedious. Nope.

The open world nature of this game is truly awe-inspiring. You travel among various islands, killing pirates who have wronged you and your friends. The weapons are great. The environment is even better. Once, I was trying to stealth up behind two enemies walking down a road. Suddenly, a tiger came out of no where and killed them both. There are random acts of awesome things like that every where. I have accidentally fallen off cliffs, landed in deep water, and found new places to explore. I have thrown a molotov cocktail at one enemy, and watched as the ensuing fire engulfed the jungle, huts, and other enemies as it spread. The physics in this game are amazing to watch.

Best weapon? The bow. You can kill with stealth, but the real money shot is an arrow modified to have an explosive tip. A jeep full of enemies coming to kill you? Explosive arrow: it is just something you need to see to fully appreciate. You can drive the jungle roads (realistically I might add) in cars, jeeps, and ATV's. You can hang glide from tall cliffs. If you can see it, you can pretty much travel to it. Although Ubisoft marketed this game as ""Skyrim with guns!"" the open world really reminded me of the GTA series but in the jungle instead of the city. And, it has a decent story with quality voice acting.

Truth be told, if I had purchased this game when it came out last year for full price, I would have felt I got my money's worth. I am still glad I waited because it was even sweeter to pick it up so cheap. So, if you are a bit jaded in the FPS realm like I am, you might want to give this a try when it is next on sale. (although its current price of around $30 is still a great deal) You might be pleasantly surprised like I was."
2957,4,"Ok, I love this game to death. All though I could use the money to buy Sonic battle or other but I wanted this game here. I played it and it remended me of a RPG but you have more options to move around. The only thing I have a problems with this game is that in is full of mini-games. Mini-games that you MUST complete in order to move on in the game. But of course if you love the bitter irony of Luigi being the Mr. Green fraidy-cat then go on and by the game. I laugh during most of the game play cause the animations remended me of some silly anime expressions. Hmm. That's nintendo for you."
2958,4,"My son (7) can wear these as well as my husband. They have a large range of adjustment.  Neither of them complain of them hurting after extended wear.

Also it's amazing to no longer be stuff listing to some of thw youtubers he is obsessed with now! :)"
2959,4,"I'm a big fan of console games that allow co-op play.  I recently played BATMAN:  RISE OF SIN-TZU and TURTLES.  I can say that BATMAN is much more enjoyable co-op game.  It has problems, for sure, but the potential for improvisation is much, much greater than in TURTLES.
Problems with the TURTLES game (in contrast to BATMAN) is the ""invisible wall"" problem -- you are locked into certain sections of the map without the ability to retreat, regroup or plunge ahead to get power-ups to help you deal with the numbers of bad guys.  Another big problem is the lack of interesting combos -- it just gets so tiring using the same strikes to beat the bad guys -- BATMAN's a much better game in that aspect -- it's almost too hard to master all of the styles (much less execute them) but TURTLES is so clunky and unimaginative -- I might buy the BATMAN game to muck around with, but I'll never go near TURTLES again (and this is coming from a fan of the old Arcade game and comic books!).
Better co-ops can be found in Dynasty Warriors, Hunter: Reckoning, or even PS1's Jedi Power Battles."
2960,4,"I just got this, and to be honest I like Horsez 2 better. This one is more complicated and takes more determination. I would NOT recommend this for a young kid. It would be great for those teenagers who loves horse but you don't want to buy them one. Get this game for them instead, this will keep them busy!"
2961,4,"Overall an enjoyable game for those who like stock car racing.  Lots of things here are wanting.  1) You'll find with experience that the best way to win is to slow down.  The AI drivers are set up so that the last place car will beat your lap times consistently.  2) Pit stops are stupidly slow.  Average is about 18 seconds in this game.  In reality a pit stop is slow at 15 seconds.  You won't find yourself leaving the pits in first place, ever.  3) AI drivers will mow you down if you don't give way.  Your best bet is to take the lead and avoid getting within a second of any other cars on the track.  If they get to you, they will crash you.  4) Adjustable settings for car performance?  Bull!  With practice you will soon discover that gear ratio changes don't work.  Gear set for Talladega allows speeds in the 200s.  Same gears on Martinsville top out at 120.  So enjoy the game but don't expect it to mirror anything in the real world."
2962,4,"Actually works.. A little funky to set up, sometimes you have to update the drivers. For me it's EVERY time it gets unplugged I had to reinstall the drivers.

But I can't detect any input lag which is what I was afraid of.

Now let's see how long it lasts"
2963,4,"i can only speak for myself, but i'm getting kind of tired of zombies since they are everywhere. movies, tv, videogames, everywhere it's all about zombies. dying light sort of flips that on its head in that the zombies, while scary, are nowhere near as scary as th vertigo inducing heights you have to climb to get around the environment.

it's very similar in every way to dead island, however it's far more refined and has the parkour element added to it. it also has fun Vs multiplayer where you can be a sort of uber zombie that takes on a team of 4.

there have been 2 dlc sets i haven't gotten around to playing, mostly because i feel like i had already gotten the most out of this game, however it's clear that this is a labour of love for the development team and it shows...and makes for a more enjoyable game in the process.

gameplay, like i said, is very similar to dead island, pretty simple, weapon degradation is annoying, there are multiplayer coop and vs modes.
one complaint is that trophies seem to continue to be glitched."
2964,4,"I would give ToV 3.5 stars if I could, but since I can't I'll round up to 4. I don't regret buying it and recommend it if you like the Tales series, but disagree with another poster who said he thought it was the best game in the series. I have not played all of the games in the series, but would put it behind the first game, Tales of Phantasia, which has ancient graphics but had a VASTLY superior story and VASTLY superior music.

Speaking of music, the sound is my biggest complaint about this game. I have almost everything on mute. The voice acting is terrible -- unbearably terrible. Some of the music is okay, but it rarely fits in with the scene. There is one particular track with a comedy vibe that is way over played and ruins otherwise powerful scenes if you don't put the game on mute. Imagine if, for example, in FF6 instead of the amazing sound track you had the chocobo theme playing whenever an emotionally tense situation came up. Whoever made this decision for ToV was out of their mind.

My other big complaint is how linear the game is. When you're on the world map you have the illusion of non-linearity, but if you try to explore an area before the story is ready for it (even when two towns are right next to each other), you're turned away by your own characters saying ""I don't want to go here right now"" or similar. I'd rather at least have a good reason for not being able to explore -- it's extra frustrating when your own stupid characters are limiting you.

There are many positives that balance out these negatives, and I do recommend playing the game if you like this style of RPG. The characters are well developed and most of the dialogue is good and fits the individual characters' personalities. The story is interesting, and is paced well. The battle system, like in all Tales games, is fun and minimizes some of the more grueling aspects of other JRPGs, like thoughtless button mashing and tedious health management. It's a fun game, and I looked forward to playing it when I was not gaming. I just had to play most of it on mute."
2965,4,"This is probably the best wheel for ps2's GT3, but the price bites, and unless you are some super hardcore racer, I don't think you will play it for too long before you get sick of it. Especially if you already beat GT3 game using a controller."
2966,4,But it did not come with a dlc why because the game come before any addition features. So overall it good for online play.
2967,4,for the price this game is worth it i would say. pretty easy for achievements. Graphics aren't great tho. Some of the events are fun
2968,4,Big boss fights cool weapons alot of weird things going on what more you want in a game?? Only thing that is off is the Controlls Aiming has a odd feel don't know why they cant get games right 100% always something not right. Also not much replay value this being 2011 should not be. I would say its worth about 39 bucks. If they would of packed the Game with loads of gaming value and got the controlls Right then yeah full price fine. Good luck thanks
2969,4,"Kill. Switch is not a bad game at all. In fact it is probably one of the best shoot `em ups you can get your hands on. You play Bishop, a sort of Metal Gear Solid's Solid Snake x Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher with more firepower than both combined. In fact that is what kill.switch is - one big free-for-all GUNFIGHT.
The story is actually confusing and told in flashback style (some flashback shots are cinematically realistic). Bishop is an ultra-tech Soldier and who is married to Lynn Takamura - a Neural Interface designer for some weapons tech firm. Bishop was supposed to execute a terrorist called Archer but failed. Archer came back to kill Lynn and to take control of Bishop's neural technology sending him about the globe committing terrorist acts of violence. Eventually Bishop finds a way out from Archer's control and goes to take Archer down himself.

Having said all of that, the gun fighting is first rate stuff simply because the enemy AI is the best seen in any game of its kind. The enemy is smart and moves accordingly. They will take you down by flanking you or sending a grenade in your direction. One or two hits are all it takes and you will go down. So you need to use the environment and this is where kill.switch scores in aces. As you hide behind something you can blind fire on the enemy with several different weapons to choose from or you can lean around the side, sight someone and shoot them. The detail in each level makes this one an essential purchase for the XBOX user. It pushes the PS2's graphics quite a bit (now and again the FPS stalls).
So kill.switch plays like you would expect it too - run around various levels (there are 5 major levels divided into two parts each) shooting the enemy and diving behind boxes as you blow things up. Sounds boring or unoriginal - yes, maybe - but kill.switch does it all so furiously. Once you start firing and throwing grenades and dancing about the obstacle pulling off headshots with some blind fire you will see how enjoyable all of this really can be and for that kill.switch is all golden 5 stars.
However it does have some negatives. The story is simply very hard to understand and makes no sense. The zooms are not very deep on the gun scopes meaning that you do not really get to zoom around and see the awesome sights that they have designed. It could have done with better zooms. It was absolutely terrible that they did not make more objects destructible. You couldn't even shoot up things like tables and chairs. I didn't see a single wall blow out in the game.
In the end I would not really purchase this unless you like blast em ups. If blast em ups are your thing then do not even think twice about this review. Stop now and go pick up kill.switch. It is insane live fire from start to finish. You will get a bang for your buck. However if you are looking for a game that might do something other than that (forget any type of Splinter Cell objectives or Metal Gear Solid coolness) then I suggest you go look elsewhere.
Pros:
- Furious action. Non-stop suppressing fire.
- Amazing enemy AI. The best of any game out there.
- Highly detailed graphics.
- Blind-fire. A very cool option.
- In terms of action this is what MGS and SC want-to-be but are not.
- Cuts scenes are realistic.
Cons:
- There appears to be no screen size adjustment on PS2 version.
- Runs a little slow on the PS2 at times.
- Short. Really only 6 to 8 hours of start to end game play.
- No environmental destruction.
- Extremely limited objectives.
- Story makes no sense."
2970,4,"I had been anticipating Tomb Raider Underworld for a long time. Ever since the cliffhanger ending in Legend, I don't think there was a Tomb Raider fan alive who wasn't eagerly waiting for the resolve.

A few notes:
If you haven't played Legend, you really need to. This is a direct continuation of its story line. If you don't know what happened in Legend, you'll be lost with the story contained in Underworld. A passing knowledge of what happened in Anniversary would also be advised.

The good:
There was a conscious effort on the programmer's part that if it seems like Lara should be able to do something, she can do it. For the first time the technology was available to let Lara do virtually anything the programmers could imagine. Poles Lara could only swing from before, she can now swing, perch, balance and fire a gun from. By far, this version of Lara can do more than she could in any previous game.

The areas are huge and, for the most part, non-linear. There are a couple sections near the end where you're basically being herded down a single corridor. But for the most part, this is the epitome of what a ""go anywhere, do anything"" exploration game should be. If you know exactly what you're supposed to do, you can probably breeze through certain puzzles. But if you want to take time to explore and see what the game has to offer, you'll find it has a lot.

The story is also very involving. Like I said, it's a continuation from Legend. So if you've played that, you already have a vested interest in what happens to these characters. Underworld really delivers on finally resolving the story between Lara and Amanda, Lara and Natla...and even Natla and Amanda.

The bad:
As much as I hate to find fault with this game, I have to be honest, there are some faults to be found.

As stated in other reviews, the camera is really buggy. This more than any of the other bugs had me frustrated at times. It never became a game spoiler for me. But many times, you not only can't move the camera to where it would be of utmost advantage, many times it's a challenge just to move it to where it's not utterly useless. This more than anything keeps me from giving this game that fifth star.

While not nearly as irritating as the camera, I also have noticed frame rate issues. But those tend to come and go. There's a brief moment on the part of the player of ""what's going on?"" But it passes and you're back on your way exploring.

Cinematics are not unlockable like they were in Legend and Anniversary. Once you've gone past them, that's it. Only chance you'll have to see them again is if you either start a new game or go on Youtube.

That brings me to my final point. Since cinematics are no longer unlockable, there's really not much else worth unlocking. There's character concept art, weapon concept art, level concept art and equipment concept art. It's hardly worth going into the ""treasure hunter"" mode to unlock it all in my opinion. It's a good thing that the levels are so huge and that it should take the average player a good while to finish the game. Because given the lack of anything worthwhile to unlock, that leaves little to nothing in the way of replay value.

Final notes:
This is a fun game. I hate that I had to list so many faults, because really this is a fun game. But you should know before spending the money that this does lack that certain amount of polish. As far as I'm concerned, though the good does outweigh the bad. If you're a Tomb Raider fan, you should get this game. If you're dying to find out how the Legend cliffhanger finally resolves, get this game. Just realize you may need to forgive the game for having a few little quirks."
2971,4,"Toy story 3 the ps3 version is the best one wii and ds versions suck in comparison i have no idea why the wii version was dumbed down so much the wii is capable of better than that like the godfather,scarface, rune factory plus many others are great for the wii back to the review at hand toy story3 is definitely what licensed games need to mimic there are alot of movie based games hardly any are good scarface godfather king kong and over the hedge and the bee movie toy story has a short but challenging story toy box mode is definitely the best part of the game 100+ challenges exploring an open world finding prize capsules for customizing town folks, buildings great multi player fun I'm 34 years old I'm not afraid to admit I play toy story plus lego games i also play mature and adult only games.also make sure you buy the American game imports don't have all the customization options"
2972,4,"A title that seemed one of the big dogs at E3 when it was announced but then flew right under the market. I completely forgot about this game until I heard about it being on sale and picked it up for a modest $8. For $60 bucks, I could see myself being a little disappointed, but for $40 and below its one hell of a bargain.

The storyline is involving, and really draws you in. As you learn more about the estate and the people involved, you begin to see cut scenes from your past that slowly piece together why exactly you are in the situation you are in. Lots of collectibles and unlockables, so it gives you reason to replay the campaign. In addition to these, as you slaughter countless enemies, you rack up BLOOD points which you use to learn new skills and enhance your abilities. If a portion of the story is giving you an increasingly hard time (and trust me, there are sections that are extremely difficult) you can always grind a couple levels before and rank up your skill so the harder portion is easier to beat. (Have yet to do this myself but I know the option is available.)

What shocked me most is how well the story is told. In addition to the survival horror elements the gameplay provides, the eerie atmosphere perpetuated by the environment keeps you on your toes, while the narration of the Terror Mask relaxes with you with temporary comedic relief. Its an experience in itself how the game constantly sways your mood through the proper use of comedy, horror, and drama that the story seamlessly blends.

If you are looking for a complex and intricate experience, you are looking at the wrong title. If you want a couple months of fun and some good laughs, don't hesitate to pick this up, for the price its at now, its unbeatable.

Did I mention you can also unlock the previous 3 splatterhouse games? Yeah, they're there too."
2973,4,"Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 2 continues SNK's current stream of compilation games of the various franchises, and compiles three more titles in the Fatal Fury series.  Real Bout: Fatal Fury, Real Bout: Fatal Fury Special, and Real Bout 2: The Newcomers are all featured here, and are all re-produced in all their Neo-Geo glory.  While the games have certainly aged, they are still better than a majority of the games compiled on the first Fatal Fury Battle Archvies disc, as the animations and controls are mostly fluid, and with the budget price, you really can't go wrong if you are a fan of the series or a fan of 2-D fighters in general.  However, it should be noted that Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves is not included here.  What may very well be the best game in the entire series, Mark of the Wolves is nowhere to be found, which is a crying shame considering it was one of the best 2-D fighters to ever come out of SNK period.  That aside, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 2 is still a smash, and if you're an SNK or 2-D fighter fan, you really can't go wrong here."
2974,4,works
2975,4,"If you're a gamer who's been playing for the last fifteen years or so, there's a good chance at some point, you played a Dynasty Warriors game.

Living by the old adage ""If it ain't broke, add motion and touch controls,"" Dynasty Warriors NEXT takes the tried and true formula of slashing thousands of soldiers to ribbons on your way to world domination to the next level by adding superfluous touch features and curious motion controls, the latter which can thankfully be turned off.

It may seem I'm being overtly cynical, and that's because I get a kick out of how many times Koei can release virtually the same title, but that doesn't detract from what's important:  Dynasty Warriors NEXT is a lot of fun, and surprisingly polished.

The graphics are impressive, the controls are excellent, and the gameplay is fun.  NEXT has elements of Empires and its base is Dynasty Warriors 7: Xtreme Legends.  NEXT also includes some quick-time elements and has a few other gameplay additions that inject some new blood in the series.

The Vita has one of the most impressive launch line-ups I've seen and it is easy for a title such as this to be ignored, and that's understandable considering the saturation of the Dynasty Warriors series, though that shouldn't discourage you from picking this game up if you enjoy the gameplay these titles deliver.  This is solid entry with a lot of content and it doesn't feel slapped together to get it out the door for the launch window.  If you enjoy murdering thousands of soldiers I recommend picking up Dynasty Warriors NEXT."
2976,4,"I like this game, but I didn't love it.  The first one was a sleeper, and a really enjoyable great game.  This is the first Castlevania where you can play as Dracula, but it seems that this Dracula is lacking in strength.  I wish that you were able to make Dracula a bit more powerful.  The map was very confusing as well, considering that there were basically two seperate maps.  Overall, I did enjoy the game though.  The opening sequence was my favorite part, and it is an uphill battle from that point on.  The story line was pretty interesting, something different from all of the previous Castlevanias.  I would say that if you are a Castlevania fan, or a just a fan of the first Lord of Shadows, then this one deserves your attention as well."
2977,4,"EARTHWORM IS BACK WITH ALL NEW ENIMES AND LEVALS TO PLAY. THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR SEGA SATURN, YOU SHOULD BUY IT."
2978,4,"As a CIA operative, rather than a common thief there are a few perks. You can call for a drop off of a vehicle or an extraction to one of your safe houses. The harpoon and parachute are lots of fun. You can jump from the 'chute to the hood of a car and have the driver ferry you around too. Compared to GTA the aerial system is much better. The music is awesome and different for every vehicle - it totally fits well into the game. The story missions are fun too, however much of the game feels like padding.

There are like 100 settlements you can overthrow. All pretty much the same. Also there are 50 or so drug cartel villas you can overthrow (same as the towns only with a boss). The towns and villas are the same as each other (kill guys, blow up roadblock). The map is huge - it is way, way too big and too much time is spent traveling.

I overthrew lots of the towns and villas and did all 21 of the story missions to complete the game. After completing the game it just felt very shallow.

If they narrowed the landmass of the game or spent some time giving some of the areas even a modicum of distinctiveness this would be a great game. I would suggest the game, (and hope for JC2) but as it stands it is just a good GTA style game."
2979,4,"This game is entertaining, especially with the choice options. You can choose to be bad, good, or somewhere in-between. Not for minors. There can be sexual situations (hetero- and homo-), obscene gestures, and alcohol consumption. Players choice, of course."
2980,4,"Indigo Prophecy is in some ways a very innovative adventure game, and in other ways, extremely old fashioned with regards to the devices it puts you up against to get you through the story. Luckily, the game as a whole survives the weird amalgam of new and old school, and makes for an intrigueing and exciting experience.

The story is what makes the game stand out the most, though. You play as the hero Lucas Kane, who suddenly finds himslef commiting a brutal murder while seemingly under some kind of possession. It's up to you to figure out what made you (him?) do it, which involves evading the police and gaining the trust of people who can provide clues to unlocking the mystery. Gameplay is different to most 3rd person adventures I have played. You can control your character movements, but all actions other than moving around can only be performed when you see an icon on your screen that relates to a certain ""hotspot"" you have found. Opening a door, using the bathroom and pouring a drink are probably not the most exciting things you can do in a videogame, but they all have to be done in this one, and you do need to get comfortable with the quick response controls because when the tension rises, you have to start making some pretty sharp decisions. The best parts of the game are the bits where you have a crisis situation suddenly develop, such as suspicious police knocking at your door, or a pitch-dark basement crawling with escaped lunatics to escape from, and you need to think fast as well as control what your character does, often with an onscreen timer counting down on the time you have left. I enjoyed these sequences a lot, and you really do get the outcome you deserve based on the decisions you make in those vital seconds. This time-attack approach is also applied to many question and answer conversations with other characters...to get the most out of some encounters you must think quickly and choose appropriate questions (or responses ) from a limited choice before a timer runs out. This can be fun too, and as you can imagine, outcomes vary considerable based on your judgement.

 At other times, a different control scheme comes into play. At certain critical moments, the screen will present you with pictoral representations of directional commands that you must apply with both the left and right analogue sticks, to ensure the best outcome to a sequence. This could be Lucas taking flight from mysterious apparitions, or just playing his guitar tunefully enough to win back his estranged girlfriend. The on screen prompts can be quite punishing, as they invariably get faster and more complex as an action sequence nears its conclusion. Sometimes you are even told to repeatedly mash two buttons as fast as you can to perform some strenuous task such as lifting something very heavy - see what I mean about old school? All good finger-aching fun, though.

The look of the game is fairly polished, although the graphics are not incredibly detailed, but the atmoshphere is quite impressive. The characters are particularly well rounded, with good looking and well animated faces. Lucas makes an effective and realistic hero, and he's not the only playable character. You also get equal playing time with two police officers, Carla and Tyler. All three of these main characters have subtle personality traits and distinct emotions that make them really come alive. The voiceover work in the game is excellent, and there is a lot of it, as all conversations are spoken in full by the voice actors, and they do really good jobs.

I've enjoyed the experience of Indigo Prophecy so much I don't really want to draw attention to any flaws, but I think it would be positive to point them out as the game overall is so effective. Firstly the movement control for the characters is problematic. This is because the in-game camera is totally fluid, so it's constantly swooping around and changing viewpoint, which means your control over the direction you want to head in is continually and repeatedly undermined. In timed sequences (such as a flashback where the young Lucas must quickly find three boys hiding in a dangerous building before it explodes), this movement handicap is a hazard that can potentially ruin the mission for you. Secondly, the action sequences where you must move both analogue sticks in the directions flashing up on screen are some of the most exciting sections of the story...but you can't possibly watch the drama unfolding as your concentration has to stay glued firmly to the on-screen prompts so as not to muck up the sequence you have to follow. I only have a vague recollection of a very striking sequence in which Lucas' apartment literally disintegrates around him, because I was staring at coloured dots and trying to keep him alive, and I could not afford to blink and miss a single one. For the record, game designers, please don't show the best visuals in the game at a time when the players attention will be totally wrapped up in watching something else! A better idea would have been to run a ""wait for it"" visual sequence under the button pressing promtps, and then show the unfolding visuals as a reward.

My last point is rather more of a niggle - throughout the game, you switch between playing as Lucas, and the two police officers Carla and Tyler - yet your motivations for playing them are in direct opposotion to each other! As Lucas you must evade the police, and as Carla or Tyler you must track Lucas down and catch him. Yet whenever you play as either party, you are expected to play your hardest to make that character succeed. This seems most nonsensical in one sequence when, playing as Lucas, you must hide in an apartment as Tyler searches it. If you are found it's game over - yet from Tyler's point of view this would count as a victory. I found this very odd. I suppose the idea is to keep both parties heading forwards, but on a parallel course, so that the mystery can be fully unravelled before Lucas is wrongfully incarcerated by the law. I guess it doesn't ruin the game, and as the characters were all so well crafted, I did want them ALL to succeed, so I always appreciated victories on both sides. Even the rather salacious ones like helping Tyler's attempts to get some lovin' with his girlfriend, which shows the lighter side of the developers intentions.

I think Indigo Prophecy is a success, most obviously because I found it very hard to switch off every time I started playing, and if the few control issues are fixed, I would really relish playing a sequel. The storyline does take increasingly bizarre turns towards then end, and the pay-off is not as epic or rewarding as the mystery-filled early stages might have promised. Even so, with a ""choose your own adventure"" game like this, there's always replay value if you think you could have made better choices along the way, and I'm definitely glad I tried it."
2981,4,"I am not usually a fan of fighting games, but this one is really good, fights are pretty good, quality and graphics are pretty good, and you sure can kick some... the story mode is too short, and training is hard, the ign review is pretty accurate."
2982,4,Not love but like. This rubber grip gives you alot of grip but needs to be smoothed out with a razor blade before use. I'm happy.
2983,4,"I don't want to really waste your time so i will keep it short
Mad World has some very addicting gameplay, it just gets a little bit boring after a while
However, the boss fights are by far the coolest part to this game.  They are fresh, challenging, and very fin to watch the finishers.
4 out of 5"
2984,4,My son loves this game. Would be even better if you were able to play more than 1 on the same Xbox
2985,4,"Cheap and gets the job done.  But one issue I came across was that the joint of the cable gets loose after intensive usage exposing the wire.  The cable is cheap enough for me to toss it and get new ones, no big problem."
2986,4,"While not too often ""scary"", Dead Space has slick and responsive controls that put other games in its genre to shame. A shooter at its core, Dead Space tells a simple story in a surprisingly believeable world.
 A creepy new religion based on worshipping alien artifacts controls two of the biggest corporations on Earth and silent engineer, Issac Clark (the player character) is left to pick up the pieces when a ship that's picked up one of these artifacts goes dark.
Most of the monsters (necromorphs) play fair and you never really feel cheated when you die.
The game makes good use of its setting with certain rooms on the ship devoid of oxgyen or gravity. These areas of the game are the most fun. Shooting monsters while moon jumping and watching nervously as your oxygen counter ticks down is intense and exciting.
Unless you're easily grossed out, or frightened, I reccomend this game to anyone who likes action/adventure or shooters.

Also, this is not a game for kids. You should probably be at least 14-15 to play, as the game can get pretty graphic at times and the language isn't kid-friendly."
2987,4,Holds 8 ps vita games.  Snaps open/close to secure the carts.  Basically I purchased to have my games organized in one place to lessen the chance of misplacing them since the Vita carts are small.  Good buy.
2988,4,All good.
2989,4,"After spending some more time with this game i have decided to write a more in depth review of this game. First off let me say that i think that this game is good. It however is not that much different than the previous sims game for Xbox 360 (which i also own) except for the addition of a few new things such as the addition of different pets (Cats & Dogs) and a new town as well as the Mysteriologist addition which in my opinion is more of an annoyance than anything else. Now on to the bad (at least in my opinion) First thing is this game lags there are times when you will be going to a store or the movie theater and be waiting to walk in and your character will just be standing there for awhile before entering,there have been times when my character has been trying to have a conversation with another sim and will just be standing there like a dumba**.There are also bugs in this game, my character has literally gotten stuck in grass,my dog has had part of his body inside of a wall and the other part outside of it..Seriously EA ?.Also as far as the pets go its cool but EA could have done more with it. I think that by this stage in The Sims games they could have included a few exotic pets such as ferrets & possibly a few species of reptiles to add a little something different to the mix. Overall i feel that EA could be doing more with these games and also feel that they should take the time to tweak these games so that they perform better than they are before releasing them..Overall this is a good game but it has a few things that are just downright irritating."
2990,4,"This is one of the best extreme sports games i have played, although it was way to easy to beat. its just like THPS3 its lots of fun but not enough missions and levels. if there is ever a 3rd one make more levels please, it would be more fun. i would have given 5 stars but there isn't enough levels"
2991,4,"Nice game, but no body plays the dlc's."
2992,4,"I like it.  The graphics are fantastic, and the game is fun.  I just wish you could move the characters around better.  If they added more melee  attacks, that would be awesome.  But overall it's still a good game.  Hopefully they make a ""REAL"" RE game.  Like others, I want the zombies, helping people aspect of the game.  I miss the outbreak series a lot.  They have plenty of fans for both games they are trying to make.  But I guess time will tell.  Until then, this is the best thing we are going to get."
2993,4,"i like RPGs, especially the ones back in the old days when you get lots of classes, spells, party members, etc. As a result, i wasn't impressed with Dragon Age when i first started playing it. You have a total of three races to choose from and, worse, only three classes you can choose (fighter, wizard, thief). i also haven't been a huge fan of Bioware's recent RPGs where the amount of story and cut scenes goes up and the number of spells, enemies and options goes down. Plus Bioware's always been pretty bad at AI

So i wasn't really looking forward to this game but apparently my family thought i should have been, because i got this for Christmas. And, it turns out, i liked the game, much more so than many of the recent Bioware games

The things i worried about were still there. There are embarrassingly few spells which is made worse by the new cool down timers that haven't been present in earlier Bioware games. You can pick subclasses later but they're not easy to get (ex - becoming a healer requires finding the one shop keeper who sells an incredibly expensive book on how to be that class). You fight the same handful of enemies over and over. Dialog options and options in general are more limited than i expected. The pathfinding is much improved and combat behavior is much better than in KotOR but still flaky (especially at the start when your tanks always run away, letting the bad guys go straight for the mages) can be flaky and the paying for tactical slots to set your AI is unneccessary. Since switching to 3D, Bioware has been awful at making pretty levels, and while they aren't gorgeous here (and still painfully linear), they're much better than Mass Effect. Despite the problems, the game was still fun. It's an interesting enough story and the story lines (werewolf curses, marriages of convenience, angry ex-wives, gold digging sisters, etc.) are pretty good. i liked having a dog. In the end, i almost had as much fun playing this as i did The Witcher

There were a few things i didn't like. First, the documentation. It's a new system, not D&D rules, so it would be helpful if there were more explanation about defense vs. armor, what armor bypass does, how much damage spells do, what physical resistance does, whether dragons are resistant to fire or hurt more by cold, how the fatigue numbers are calculated and a dozen other things that were important but are impossible to tell from the game's feedback. Second, the difficulty was surprisingly difficult on normal level, and since almost every good spell kills your party, mages are fairly useless. Third, the inventory system wasn't much fun. Fourth, all the characters were a little too over the top extreme, with the dwarf especially painful to listen to. And there weren't enough of them - if you make the obnoxious stripper leave (which is easy to do), you'll play the entire game with no magic users (unless you count the elderly healer, which you shouldn't). Only a rogue can learn to pick a lock (no knock spells here) but rogues can't fight so you don't want to waste one of the 3 NPC slots on one

i still prefer the flexibility of Oblivion, spells in the original Baldur's Gate, design of Planescape and general fun of Fallout but once you get past how constrained and linear Dragon Age is, it's actually pretty fun"
2994,4,good game but it needs to be larger.  400 items is just not enough
2995,4,"The kids would play this all day and all night if we let them. The first couple of times I played it, I didn't think it was much different than Mario Kart Wii - but - I can't concentrate much when I'm racing on the improved graphics and gameplay. When you step back and watch others play it, you can really see the difference and the major improvements. This is a must buy, and if you loved past version of mario kart, it might even be worth it to get a Wii U just for this game if you don't have one. Happy Racing!"
2996,4,"Truly authentic simulation with accurate representation of the pros look and skill levels. Truly balanced and once you get the controls down, a ton of fun. Plus, super cheap."
2997,4,the loading screens kinda get long and old but if you are into the old school games this one is for you.
2998,4,"Battlefield: The Complete Collection is what I would call bang for the buck. For the price of a mediocre meal at a third-rate restaurant, you get four different versions of the game voted ""Best of 2002."" Of course, one could argue that 2002 was a long time ago, and that graphics, sound, AI and so forth have come an enormously long way since then, one would also be missing the point. Some games are very playable and stand the test of time; some don't. Battlefield may not be an all-time classic by any means, but it remains a cheap, and mostly good, time.

 This set includes the original game (Battlefield 1942), plus two add-ons (The Road to Rome and Secret Weapons of WWII) and a completely different game called Battlefield: Vietnam. To get right to the point:

 1942: This game features a number of more or less historical battle scenarios covering the years 1942 - 1945, and featuring such combatants as the USA, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Great Britain, Free France, Russia and Japan. In each game you pick a side (Axis or Allied), and once the battle's commenced, choose which type of soldier you want to be: infantryman, engineer, medic, bazookaman or sniper. Each has different weapons and different advantages, and disadvantages, to the player. In addition, there are loads of playable vehicles, from motorcycle sidecars to landing craft to tanks, and in some scenarios, playable aircraft as well. The objective of every scenario is to ""capture the flags"" by seizing various control points on the map, and by defending them once they are captured. As you will most likely be shot dead or blown up a number of times each scenario, you can appear on the battlefield in many different guises (sniper, medic, whatever) during one battle; you can also pick up the weapons and equipment of the dead if you wanna change, say, from a Browning Automatic Rifle to a Schemisser. The very best scenario on here is ""Omaha Beach"", which is action-packed, requires good tactical thinking, and is equally fun played on either side; but many of the others are cool as well, including the airborne scenario ""Arnhem Bridge"", the desert battle ""Battleaxe"" and the brutal massacre that is ""Stalingrad.""

 Road to Rome: This is the same game, but adds a number of battles specific to the Italian campaign of 1943 - 1945. It would be worth owning just for the superb ""Monte Casino"" scenario alone, an all-out brawl between the Germans and the French commandos for control of a monastary atop a huge hill.

 Secret Weapons: Again, the same game, but with a number of scenarios featuring ""wonder-weapons"" such as jet aircraft, guided missles, super-heavy tanks, and yes, even a jet pack. This has some outrageously fun stuff on it, including airborne assaults and commando raids like ""Kelby Airfield"", ""Mimoquoyes"", ""Essen"" and ""Telemark Research Base.""

 Vietnam: This game came after the others and is better graphically and in terms of playability and sound-effects. It covers the Vietnam war from the POV of the USA, plus North and South Vietnam. The weapons are fantastic, especially the M-60 machine gun. It also addresses some of the smaller problems of the previous games, such as providing a counter to show you how long it will take before you ""own"" a control point. It even has great rock music by the Clash, Jefferson Airplane, and CCR. On the downside, it has many boring scenarios. The best seem to be ""Cambodian Incursion"" and the various Hue battles.

 What works for Battlefield as a rule is that is reproduces combat in a fairly realistic way without being too realistic to be fun. There is a great attention to detail on such things as uniforms, weapons, and equipment, and the variety of weapons and vehicles is pretty impressive. Some of the battles, such as Omaha Beach, Monte Cassino, Cambodian Incursion, Essen, Telemark, etc., etc. are almost criminally addictive, and it's just a trip to drive a Tiger tank, get behind a 50-cal machine gun or squint into the scope of a sniper rifle and try to pick off bad guys from 300 yards out. It's also cool to play a scenario from one side and then tackle it from the other; you see the challenges of both attack and defense from the tactical point of view. Though the game is an FPS with plenty of grenade-hurling, machine-gun firing action, it also requires some thought. Simply charging up the middle with guns blazing works occasionally, but like as not it leads to a little message in the corner that says that Hans-J&uuml;rgen Klossmeyer just killed you with his trusty K-98.

 Now we get to the flaws. The first, and most annoying problem is the design of the boards. Many are too large versus the number of troops involved, which means a lot of tedious running-around. Next beef: the aircraft. A lot of the scenarios have aircraft you can fly into battle, and a few (""Battle of Britain"" for ex.) revolve entirely around flying. Given the beautiful graphics on the planes, that would be great...except that between using the mouse and the keyboard as controls, it's nearly impossible to do more than take off, fly in a straight line, and then crash. Another huge issue, in my mind, is the fact that no matter how many friendlies you have nearby, every enemy soldier seems to shoot exclusively at you. Topping this is the fact that the enemy's accuracy is often astonishing (nothing like getting killed by a pistol shot taken at a quarter mile's distance), and sometimes his tanks and so forth seem to be indestructible, while yours often seem to be made of tin. Finally, the number of ""dud"" scenarios is painfully high.

 I'd like to wind up by saying that despite all the flaws, this remains a good time and a great bargain. Between the total number of scenarios and the fact you can play each from either side, there's a lot of game here, and the gaming is often good. To misquote General Patton, ""All real Americans love the sting of battle, especially when conducted from your chair with beers in easy reach."""
2999,4,Fun game but the graphics r not as good as the 64s. It is more like the snes version for graphics anyway. I played this game all the time when it first came out. It was the only GBA game i wanted to play after a while. It has a good two player mode not many GBA games had two player. I thought the graphics were good at first untill i got the ds mario kart and i stoped playing it. Then i thought the graphics were horrible but u got to remember its the GBA and it came out in 2001. Now its 2009 and sometimes i still play it. The 64 graphics were only better because nintindo went computerized with is so it had more of unblocky graphics. But this and the snes have about the same graphics. The sound is pretty good so over all i give this game a 7.5/10 but mostly because of the graphics compared to the ds but i got to remember that it is 8 years old.
3000,5,A must buy for anyone that loves uncharted series.
3001,5,"I'm not a big video game freak, but I do enjoy this PSP and God of War.  It is a somewhat short game, but I don't have the patience that I once had for video games.  Action packed and easy to play for a bit, save and come back to it later.  If you don't have a PSP, this one seems like a great buy - I don't think I would have gotten as much gameplay out of Daxter or the Star Wars game that comes in other packages."
3002,5,"""Satisfied"""
3003,5,very nice.
3004,5,"Very good controller, it was as described, good price"
3005,5,This comes with an extra headset with a 3.5 mm jack. This chatpad fits on an elite controller with all paddles attached and plenty of room. The Elite controller is heavy and this does not add much weight. This chatpad fits attached to the Elite controller in the carrying case that came with the elite controller. I am very pleased with this product as it has a game/party chat mixer and volume control on the pad itself.
3006,5,"Fun , it's really enjoyable all the different missions and horses it really cool"
3007,5,I need it to have the entire collection of disney infinity 1.0 figures
3008,5,"Here's everything you need to know about this new Super Mario Bros series of amiibos:

1) The Super Mario Bros (SMB) series, also referred to as the Mario Party 10 series, and Super Smash Bros (SSB) series amiibo, function identically. That means you can use a SSB amiibo in Mario Party 10, and a SMB amiibo in Super Smash Bros. It's up to you which game you want to associate your amiibo with.

2) Each amiibo can only save one game's data to it at a time. So while you can use it for any supported game as mentioned above, you can't save SSB and MP10 data to one single amiibo. But you can always switch back and forth between games; you are never locked into one game. If you decide to ditch your level 50 Smash Bros Mario amiibo data to use it in MP10, you can always overwrite the Smash data no problem.

3) The #2 section above only applies to game compatibility that *writes to* amiibos. Many games and features only require *reading from* the amiibo figures. For example, in Mario Party 10, you can get daily in-game bonuses by scanning *any* amiibo. This only reads the amiibo data, and doesn't write back to it. So you can scan your SSB-associated amiibo for in-game bonuses without interfering with SSB save data on the amiibo. Similar concepts apply to Hyrule Warriors and Mario Kart 8.

4) This new SMB series is a different, larger scale of physical figure from the SSB series. I placed some comparison pictures in the review so you can see the difference. It's not major, but it is noticeable, and makes them look a little bit awkward when placed next to each other. They also have a red base with white/gray checker pattern on them, instead of the black+gold base with the SSB logo on them.

5) These are really high quality for the price, and just plain awesome, whether you are a collector, or just have a casual gaming interest in them.

6) So far, Toad is the only new character in the SMB amiibo series that isn't a duplicate of an existing SSB amiibo with a different pose.

7) If you're a collector, make sure you search YouTube for how to open the amiibo packaging, in a way that leaves it mostly intact (to reuse for display purposes) while letting you remove the amiibo to actually use.

8) Since the launch of this series coincides with Mario Party 10's release, here is a list of fully compatible amiibo with the game:
Mario / Gold Mario
Luigi
Peach
Toad
Yoshi
Wario
Rosalina
Donkey Kong
Bowser

Of those above, Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser all have existing amiibo in the Super Smash Bros series, with a different pose and look. Though as mentioned above, function identically. Rosalina and Donkey Kong are so far *only* in the SSB series (likely to change in the future). Toad is the only one unique to the SMB series of amiibo. And finally, Wario is currently not available in any series, though that will also change very soon.

In Mario Party 10, the above listed amiibo get special unlocks (amiibo base designs) each day you scan them in the game. They also support unlocking and saving tokens to them as you play the Amiibo Party mode. Every other amiibo is still compatible with MP10 in a smaller way. You get one coin bonus per amiibo per day that you scan. So even Sonic the Hedgehog can help you unlock some of the stuff in Toad's in-game store!

Gold Mario is a Walmart exclusive and functions almost identically to Mario, but automatically unlocks a Gold Token in Mario Party 10, which is pretty sweet.

Hope that helps, now submit that order and keep growing your amiibo collection!"
3009,5,This is a very fun game and it did not stray far at all from the first games formula they changed very little which is why I think it will be another great game with tons of DLC to come!
3010,5,"It's fine, worked out as posted."
3011,5,Excellent product just what I wanted!!!!
3012,5,Good
3013,5,"I've always loved the Might & Magic series and this one is no exception. I love first person, turn-based-party games. I have been dumb enough to periodically waste money on some of the various third person games out there like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, but I hate third person and cannot get into it at all. Might & Magic does not have that problem.

This game is the third in this format after MM6 & MM7 and has the most tweaks. Some say the story and engine are getting a little long on the tooth but that is fine with me. I have become so engrossed it them that I have played all three of them at least three times each. There is no other game that even comes close.

Despite the crudeness factor, I love the graphics. The spell system is just right, and I don't mind all the monster bashing. The story kept me engaged each time I played, even knowing the outcome the second and third time around.

I just wish someone would continue the series in the same format with maybe 3-D graphics but the same game play and all the rest. I give a hats off to the Might & Magic Tribute people who are doing it on their own, since no company seems interested in doing it.

Highly recommended."
3014,5,"This game is one of the best RPGs i have played in recent years. it was very fun and i was into the game til the very end. It has a very good story and battle system too.
Seriously, i couldn't get sick of the battle system, it was fun throughout the whole game.

This game isn't even short, if you do all the sidequests too you can finish the game in maybe 70 hours so its well worth it.

Even the load times were short, i pretty much have nothing bad to say about this game so if you like RPGs get this game."
3015,5,Thanks!
3016,5,"Dragon Age: Origins picks and chooses some of the better innovations of modern RPG's and combines them with the classic style of the old Infinity Engine games.  The result is the first RPG in years that can hold a torch next to Baldur's Gate II.  Dragon Age is engaging, challenging, and well written.  It offers numerous dialog and quest choices that tend to shy away from the usual trinity of paragon, uncommitted, and jerk.  And when it does tread into this all too familiar territory, the game slaps you with unexpected responses, keeping things fresh.  It is the sort of game in which you fall in love with the characters, even your enemies.  By the end of the game, your heart might even be broken as you struggle to please everyone, only to find that Dragon Age: Origins offers little in the way of unconditionally happy Hollywood endings.  It is the sort of game in which you look forward to each battle for another opportunity to test your characters' strength, and to increase their power.

It is not, of course, without faults.  The skill descriptions for your characters' abilities are a bit obtuse.  It will take some experimenting before you get the hang of the abilities.  The toolset, used for making your own adventures and items, has quite a steep learning curve.  And then there is the downloadable content advertised in game, which is a little jarring.

But these faults do little to mar Dragon Age: Origins.  Excellent gameplay, crisp graphics, an engaging story, and deliciously real characters combine to make Dragon Age: Origins one of the best RPG's in years."
3017,5,Brings back memories the games still super fun!
3018,5,"For all the Splatoon gamers out there, they need this. Works perfectly fine with the Wii U."
3019,5,"I don't care who you are, or where you live. If you came to this page and you're thinking about buying this game, DO IT. It's TEN BUCKS, brand new. You won't find a better deal than that anywhere, even used. This game is an awesome FPS.

BUY IT."
3020,5,Good game
3021,5,Love it
3022,5,good
3023,5,"Forza Motorsport for the xbox really was one of the best driving games for that system and todate still looks decent.

 Well now the Xbox 360 has had a few other decent car games each with there own little twist on the action . So now Forza Motorsport 2 has been released for the xbox 360 . Let me say if you been holding off on getting a car game for the xbox360 the wait is over !

 Just like with the first forza motorsport game the graphics for the 360 really put the player more into the game . Whatever kind of tv you got hooked up to the 360 , you would almost think you was watching real cars racing ! The graphics do honestly look that great , all the little details as well the areas your in look verry well done. It seems they took there time working on this . All there hard work on this Forza Motorsport 2 has made this a must have title for most any xbox 360 owner.

 The controls for the game is like any other , little time for learning what does this or that but overall most players will be able to start the game and just go at it .

 The audio to me seems to fit well with the game . I have my 360 hooked up to a 1000w sony theater system and the crashes, and all the other sounds come out great . The game still sounds verry good off tv speakers , but most tv speakers have got alot better compared to tv's of the past .

 Also Forza Motorsport 2 is loaded with about 300 cars of different makes. This is verry cool also , because it gives you a chance to drive some of those cool cars. Another thing is personalize and tune , I think most everybody likes to tweak things to make it go faster or whatever. It sounds kind of cool to tweak a car that would go from 300mph to 330mph or more after tweaking . Just check out all you can do with this feature , it adds a good amount of replay value as well .

 Final thought about Forza Motorsport 2 - The game has a good amount of replay time to it as well the fun factor . If your looking for a great game that will keep you busy with all it offers . I would say Forza Motorsport 2 is well worth the price where ever you get it at.

 Good luck and Please remember to drive safely :)"
3024,5,the Kinect is great for the whole family to enjoy and it provides great exercise for the whole body. i would recamend this to anyone
3025,5,"I really liked this game. It goes a little off the conventional Metroid design by offering a pretty in-depth story, which I personally liked. The graphics are great as is the music. The controls took a little getting used to, but ended up being pretty good. I still would have liked nunchuk support. Overall, if you like Metroid it is worth taking a look at."
3026,5,This multitap for the PS2 worked great!!! The thing is that this version of the multitap will only work for the 70000 series PS2's (the PS2 slim) and is not compatible with the 30000 and 50000 series. Be sure to check your PS2 for the correct series number and purchase accordingly.
3027,5,this is one fun game think of it like mafia 2.  there are lots of cars in the game to acquire.  in case you did not know in the game it takes place in France during WWII and it is up to you to destroy the enemy.  any cay you see just drive to your garage and it is yours.  this is to much for this game i bought my game at gamestop for like $9.30 tops.  including tax.
3028,5,"Best game of the series so far. Hard, gritty, violent, brutal and unforgiving. Play by the rules and be docile like lambs being led to the slaughter, or play it like you stole it, beat it, stab it, pummel it, shoot it, run down peds on your way to fame and glory. This game is NOT for the faint of heart or for the young or for those who walk the thin line between war and peace, it is all out war if that is what you prefer and peace?, peace is dead, who's next?. You will find gone all the little kiddy elements from games past, jet packs, parachutes, planes in every drive way, tanks, all that crap. Yes you still have have the occasional chopper, thankfully Nikko was in ""A"" war thus he knows the art of war mongering, and at best they are bland missions, or your only hopes of survival compared to previous releases. I can't say enough about the game yet at the same time i cannot say to much in respect to those who have not played it yet. Take it from me, a 50 year old gamer since the days of Pong, this is the one to own, to play, if you like more true to life games with realism such as explosions, water, cars, motorcycles, boats, damage modeling and atmosphere then you do not want to miss this game. Its fantastic on the Xbox 360 and its alright on the PS3, but anyway you slice it and which ever system you own quit holding out and JUST DO IT!, buy the dang thing you'll be glad you did. Also if you can afford it and can find it and you like these kind of things go for the Limited edition set, art book with concept drawings, audio c.d. with music from the game, a lock box, all metal (tin) by the way, to store it in and a Rock Star key chain with two keys to lock it up, it comes with a duffle to haul around your stash around in, and if you lucky a full sized Liberty City license plate, pretty cool. Outa sight, outa mind. Enjoy."
3029,5,"This game is fun.  I know, that sounds way too simple, but it is fun.  You have to solve puzzles by having your sackboy physically conquer challenges in different ""world"" settings.  My only compaint is when you die, after having several chances, you start over at the beginning of each world.  If I was better, this wouldn't be a problem.  BUT, I still enjoy playing it.  I have not gotten into creating worlds to challenge other players.  That should be good."
3030,5,"This game is always a great little time killer. Not to mention that because of being able to have multiple people playing with you my little one loves it ""daddy I want to play super heroes"".  Simple easy controls, great for all ages especially Marvel fans!!!"
3031,5,"Creepy, artful, clever."
3032,5,Good
3033,5,Fun
3034,5,I am satisfied with purchase
3035,5,"i don't know what the person who wrote the 1 star reveiw thought was so bad, but this is very useful. Yes, batteries last for 15 hours, but this lasts forever(kind of). It is great if you will use it at home. when batteries cost 6-8 dollars, it's good to spend 20, and not need to spend any more. I use the Game Boy Advance at home for 90% of the time i use it, and i think most people will use it at home for many hours, making this worth the money for anyone who uses GBA at home for more then 40 hours in their life, which would cost 20 dollars in batteries. I recommend this for anyone who owns the GameBoy Advance."
3036,5,"others games I have received have not been good when I  opened the case, this one was and the games great to."
3037,5,This is a fantastic game. So much fun with groups of 3 or more. Much better than some recent Mario Party titles.
3038,5,"I've been playing the Souls Series since Demons Souls and I have to say Dark Souls 3 brought everything that I loved about it since the beginning and nearly perfected it--except when they got rid of ""Poise"" which was disappointing, though you activate ""Perseverance"" to act as poise.

If you're tired of most games giving you no challenge, get ready for a game where the default difficulty setting is ""Very Hard"" and don't complain because you've read the warnings reviewers and players commented about the game; this is not for the light hearted.so Git Gud and have a good ol' Jolly Cooperation with friends!"
3039,5,He loved his present
3040,5,"This is a really good deal. I bought this same exact bundle from Game Stop 2 years ago and it was $380.00. For all those that don't wanna waste money on next-gen, get this. The price makes it totally worth your money."
3041,5,"First if you purchase this game know that you will be paying a additional 15.00 USD a month to play. The little add on's about some of these games doesn't get posted up front as I think it should be.
Second the folks I bought this game through were OUTSTANDING when it comes to customer support, first copy disappeared in the US post office's hands. They got another copy to me quickly and I can not say enough about their support.
Third game play is good so far, graphics and user interface (I play off a PC so its keyboard and mouse) is good to go.
Being new to this type of game I will hold off on comments about the game play as it is new to me. But it loaded and sound an graphics are pleasing to the eye over all I would say that NCSOFT did a good job on this game."
3042,5,"Zelda is back! A classic Zelda-style adventure, with great graphics, and the best use of the 3D abilities of the 3DS, that I've ever seen!

I'm worried I might be nearing the end, which is my only real annoyance. I don't hand out 5 stars often, but there is very little I can find fault in this game! Even the classic components, such as the box, bombs, and such, are updated for modern day and attention spans. Instead of having to buy or collect ammo, all items spend your stamina points.

Well worth the price!"
3043,5,Perfect Thanks!!!
3044,5,"Great game for kids & adults!  My daughter, 32, and I had a great time with this game.  Sometimes it's nice to play an innocent game for the fun of it & this is one of those games."
3045,5,Amazing condition works 100% no problems with it. For such an old game I wasn't expecting it to be such good conditon.
3046,5,"Great case, good fit. Holds up okay. Def shows scratches but better the case than the unit itself"
3047,5,Hot tubs and outdoor spaces! Yaaas! Get this because it's a lot of fun!
3048,5,Recently got this game. And Im very impressed with it so far. Much better then I expected. just remember its basically NFS most wanted 2.
3049,5,Excellent
3050,5,"A beautifully created platformer . The highlight of this game is the level design and presentation as the game is done in the style of Japanese theater (Bunraku). The gameplay is simple but solid with navigation often involving cutting your was across paths using your magic scissors.

The audio is a major part of the experience and i wouldn't recommend playing this on crappy tv speakers. The 3d is great but not necessary really.

The only downside is that at times the narration seem a bit intrusive and distracting, but other than that i have no major complaints."
3051,5,"If you are a clean person -not leaving you psp at anywhere-, I suggest you to buy it. I saw this cover good, handsome, and transpararent but by the time it will have had scratches and torn into pieces if your psp falls down..

The crystal case is not bad at all, so it comes with a plastic covering it. playing your games could be a little uncomfortable. If your psp falls down will be protected. Buy it if you like. It was for a friend of mine."
3052,5,Great game
3053,5,Love it! Lots of Fan service and super fun if you have a friend or 2 to play with online to level up your girls before you do versus matches online.
3054,5,"Playing my SNES games on my Windows XP without any problems. Just plug it in and start your emulator. No software or anything special required. I owned the original SNES back in the 90s and this controller feels right. It is a bit lighter, but only slightly. I am a 40-year-old construction worker type and know not to abuse my tools. If you use this controller with out button mashing or going nuts when you miss a jump, it should serve you well. Some games I play with this are SNES Super Star Wars, Hulk and Secret of Evermore. Have fun!"
3055,5,"They told me i wouldn't get this game for at least another 3 weeks and i got it three days later,AWESOME THANK YOU 100%."
3056,5,Just what i needed
3057,5,"Hard to say much bad about this game. I think it is one of the best games in history. Great character customization. Enough story to keep you interested without getting boring. Combat controls are fairly intuitive and make use of the fact that we all have two (at least) mouse buttons.

According to Steam, I played 300 hours over 2 years (some of that was my son but not much) so tremendous play value."
3058,5,"Best Godzilla game ever. Has just about every monster in every Godzilla movie except for King Kong - which is a Universal property. Back to the game, every monster has their own set of moves, environments are full destructible, you can brawl with up to 3 other monsters....this game is simply AWESOME! One of the best fighting games ever released on PS2 and definitely one of the most underrated."
3059,5,My son loves the game. Purchased this with his Nintendo 3ds XL
3060,5,Awesome game for children!  Love the switchable characters!  Gotta get it for your little ones.  My nephew loves it and so do I!
3061,5,"A must have. Works perfectly, and it's much better than the first 3DS that came out."
3062,5,Perfect
3063,5,"I wish more NDS games were like this one............

I didn't know it when I bought it, but this NDSi game can log on wirelessly & play card games, board games, rec. room games, & puzzles with other people around the world.  When you want to play, it hooks you up with a game in minutes.  And it's kid safe, because people can't type unique personal messages to each other.  No one can be unpleasant.

So, I can get on & play Texas Hold 'Em, Rummy, Blackjack, Reversi, & a mess of other games with perfect strangers all night - without installing more games to my PC, & waiting long periods of time for a tournament, like at ClubWPT.

If you want to play cards with friends or relatives around the world, you can do so in minutes.  Customize your user name, which you can change at any time, tell your buds offline who you are, start the game at the same time, & they'll be able to play with you across the globe.  How cool is that??  And if you can currently get online with your NDSi, you are already set.

The game saves your wins, & ranks you with other users, so you know how well you're doing.  And these games are actually good for your brain.  As opposed to so much of the stuff out there.  You will be randomly paired with people with all levels of playing abilities, some very challenging, & some cannon fodder (like me!) for any given game.

Offline, you can play in Mission Mode & unlock little rewards like special icons, backgrounds, & music.  In Free Play, you play any game you want against the CPU for practice.  The AI is not so unusually lucky that you can't beat it.  You can learn new games quickly, because the in game tutorials are easy to read.  And the sounds make you feel like you're in a real Casino.  Which, you sort of are...  You're playing in a world-wide global e-Casino.

As for cons, there are animated notices that move upwards across the lower screen that take time to get used to.  Also, if you turn on the message feature, the messages stay on the screen & don't scroll off out of view.  But if you leave them off, you won't see them.  I play on an NDSi XL, so it's always easy to see the cards & game pieces.  But I wonder if some would struggle discerning graphics with an early model NDS.

Overall though, this is the best card & board game for NDS I've found yet.  This game definitely beats online gaming at questionable sites on the PC.  It was more worth the money than half the games I've bought do far."
3064,5,Coolest and most interesting controller I ever had. I wish I could reskin my xbox one controller like this it's also very durable and you can't tell but the surface has a rough texture in places and actual scratches which adds to the cool factor quite a bit.
3065,5,this is a great buy love the saints row series alot cheaper then steam steam has it up for 49.99 but here it is 29.99 got a great deal and soon as i click buy  got my product code in my email or if you look at your games library on amazon here copy and paste it into my steam account and instant download no delay couldn't be happier sucks people put down the series because it is not serious and the story sucks i don't see why it is a asome fun ass game  and the story does not suck it is asome  and i beat both saints row 3 and saints row 4  hundreds of times and they never get boring  well i played saints row 4 at a friend house and beat it allot i decided to  pick up a copy on the pc to play all i want along with saints row 3 full package
3066,5,"I had only vaguely played the Lego Star Wars game, and Indiana Jones, well I had passed on that.  But when a green haired lego Joker is staring me in the face, who am I to resist?

The game is quite simply a nostalgia overload of goodness.  Everything you loved about Batman and everything you loved about Legos...all in one.  The game features an original storyline, not a rehash of any Batman episode or movie you've seen.  It combines all of the characters and villains that you know (Joker, Penguin, Riddler, etc) and a few that maybe you don't (Poison Ivy, Killer Moth).  And they all become controllable characters as well.  One of the best aspects of the game is the at times ingenious ways you combine the capabilities of the different characters to solve puzzles.  One may have super strength while another has mind control and another can swim underwater.  All the abilities need to be used in concert to get 100% of the experience in the game.

At times, the game feels a little hack-and-slash, but somehow it never gets old.  The constant quest for the latest unlockable, trying out a new character, or solving a perplexing puzzle...it just keeps driving you.  And rest assured there is a lot to find in this game.  It can definitely keep you busy for a while.

I don't know if all the Lego games are this good, but if you're like me, you won't regret making Lego Batman your first!"
3067,5,I usually don't play hack and slash games but Bayonetta is definitely worth playing. There was a bit of a learning curve when I first bought it. But now I'm addicted and I play it all the time.
3068,5,Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed..all ok
3069,5,"You are looking at the last great game for Game Boy Color, and what a game!  Sort of a hyrid between the Zelda franchise and Metroid, ""Shantae"" is the tale of a sexy little half genie's adventure to save her town and prove herself a heroine.  The game mixes platform elements and adventure elements quite nicely, and the play control is surprisingly tight for a GBC game.  Luckily, for all those who have suffered through playing GBC games on the GBA, ""Shantae"" comes enchanced for the GBA; brighter colors and an unlocked room.  Now now, don't ""tsk"" away this game because it relies on 8-bit technology, this game has the BEST graphic this child has ever lain his eyes on.  Shantae herself is a huge sprite and very well animated at that.  It almost looks and feels like a GBA game...but itsn't!  I suggested picking this beauty doll right up, it will definately a classic in the end."
3070,5,my son loves it
3071,5,"its a good bundle, and i have my wiiu until now"
3072,5,"This one is my favorite of all the ones in the playstation series.  While FF8 was more serious and realistic, this one takes a spin and makes the characters look younger, shorter, and for the most part a more animated, lusch vibrant world.  Everything, even the graphics, are improved in this final fantasy, plus i like the plot the best.  It seems to be a little more light hearted and less serious.  There are some great mini games in this one, as well as some great characters (Vivi is so cool) as well as some great villians.  Some may agree FF7 is the best, but i disagree... that one comes in a close second place.  This one has more of the goods.  Get this one if you are beginning final fantasy- in 7 there are so many annoying places you get stuck in... get this one."
3073,5,I am a ubisoft die hard fan so it is only normal that i got this game. I never played the past Far Cry games so I didn't know what I was going to get. I have to say that if you like open world/survivor games this is the one. So much to do its amazing looking forward to Far Cry 4!
3074,5,this color is uniqueth i love the grip handling with the n64 controllers.  the n64 and accesories are better then any other.
3075,5,Kids loved thi s game. It was factory sealed new as stated.
3076,5,AAA
3077,5,"There's a reason why Street Fighter II was such success in the arcades, and this recent upgrade of a classic fighting franchise proves it.  If you love Street Fighter or fighting games in general, then consider getting this game for your Nintendo 3DS.  Oh, by the way, if any of you own a 2DS, this game works on it too.

When you hear the bell ding, leave your corners and come out fighting!

You might be asking yourself by now, ""Can I buy this game and still have fun?""  Shoryuken!  ;)"
3078,5,"This was for my brother and he loves it. Great game, came in very good condition."
3079,5,"This is one of those games where you need to take a vacation so you can play.  A week is good enough to get through half of it.  It is just that addictive.  I am 40 hours in and probably a third of the way through the main plot line but I am grinding my characters trying to get everything right.

Like others have said, there weren't many major changes from Disgaea 4.  You still have the kind of comic, anime style plot.  There is are some of the same weapons and stores.  Gameplay is well balanced.

It is a solid continuation of the previous games.
...

I have a couple of recommendations for work from NIS.  I like Disgaea, but it would be nice to see another game with a darker, less comedic theme.  Also, I wish there was a Final Fantasy Tactics / standard RPG adventuring where I can navigate through a non battle world.  For those that don't know, Disgaea is mostly menu driven where you select the world you want to visit."
3080,5,"I hate to have to pay for the service, but the code that I received was authentic which is the most important part to me. The monthly ""free"" games are fun, too. (Free is in quotes because technically you're paying to receive them)."
3081,5,Present for the kids great price and fast shipping.
3082,5,This game has so many epic multiplayer battles that are as close to war as I have ever seen in a video game.  There is so much happening on the battlefield and it's so intense that you have to step back and catch your breath from time to time.  A really good single player campaign sets the tone for the real star of the show which is the awesome multiplayer.  A must play for shooter fans.
3083,5,great
3084,5,"Resident Evil the Remake is easily one of the best looking Games to ever be created to a console system.  The graphics are just plain beautiful.  The controls...well...uh..mmhh..SUCKS!
I don't get how people wyn about the camera angle...It was find to me.  A little frustraiting but fine.
I loved this game even though Zero was a disapointment...I loved ZERO but still The remake will be a classic in the RE series.
Lets start of by saying RE is a very messed up game...Biological mutating monsters, Zombies, ect...The game is just plain creepy..The Remake makes silent hill 3 look like another episode of micky mouse.
Lets start off with my review of everything in the game now...
The controlls..
Yes the controlls suck!  Big time!  I hated em'...Couldn't stand em...But I still managed to beat the game..It's 2 disks I think..
Capcom should have done better on the controlls.....4/5...yea...after all that whyning I still give it a 4/5..hmmm
The graphics..
Do I really need to review this?.....5/5!!!
The story..
Great...just like the Original except better and nothing was censored like the original PSX version in the U.S.  Very smart..very cool and very exciting.  The story is also great cause it has some twists and turns...Great..5/5..
Gameplay..
I liked the gameplay alot...the graphics saved it alittle though..The part with the tanks with the shark scenario with Jill and Chris was brilliant...the water movement was just...GORGIOUS....My spelling sucks I know...The tryant part was fun too...Everything was fun...and Creeeeeeeeepy...5/5
Is this the best Resident Evil game ever?...
Oh hell no...the best RE game was 3..Nemisis...I lost my PSX copy of Nemisis though but Fortunaly I baught the Gamecube version which is just as good as the PSX version...It's a port from the Dreamcast version which is good....Acctually I think Resident Evil 4 will be the best but for now it's 3...
I own almost every Resident Evil game..story wise I mean..not like added stuff capcom made like OUTBREAK..I own..mmm let's see..
Resident Evil remake
Resident Evil original PSX version
Resident Evil 2 for psx but lost it and now got the Gc version..
Resident evil 3 for GC...THE BEST RE GAME EVER!
Resident Evil Zero...Ohh this game had some potential...It is yet another RE story game..not some special thing Capcom made like The gun one and Outbreak...I've reviewd all the RE games I own on the versions I've played....This is probably 3 place for RE game...Nemisis...2..then Remake..then ZERO....
RE remake should be owned by Hardcore RE gamers...The hardest RE game I've played was 3 nd' remake...CV was alright..I didn't like it that much..I got all the way through disk 1 in the Dreamcast version and then stoped and had to return it for a friend...Didn't like it that much...
Which character has a better scenario in RE Remake?...
Will alot of people thought it was Jill but I liked Chris's story line in Resident Evil remake...I loved his character development(Donno why I said that but I think thats what it's calld...whatever..) with Rebecca Chambers...Uh I don't wanna sound like a perv but Every time I think of the name Rebecca Chambers It sounds like a porn stars name...lol..Rebecca Chambers is also in Resident evil Zero...But what was also cool about Chris is his story line is a tad bit more dramatic...like
SPOILERS...
When Jill does the right thing and gets the antodote for Richard he later gets eatin by a Huge ass Snake..
In Chris storyline When you save him he later gets torn apart by a Massive giant shark...Honestly though...They should have givin you a reason why he was at the Shark tank for a reason..THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ANY REASON...He jus...He just shows up there for no reason...Chris's version of the game is more frustraiting then Jills Part...
There was alot of other things I wanet to change about the storyline between the two like...for one example Jills Good ending..Wesker...SPOILER AHEAD...gets smacked by the Tyrant and gets away with it..I would Have rather wanted him to be killed by the Tyrant like in Chris's good ending nd' bad ending.....
This game has loads of ending even though you don't have to start the entire game over just to get a different ending....
You just have to change some stuff and make some decisions I think...Theres about 12 endings total with Chris n' Jill...
This game is over all 5/5...Or what I like to say 9.8 out of 10...
Oh!  And if you wanna see Jill again Like me then you should get Resident Evil 3 Nemisis for the Game Cube....
Later..."
3085,5,"This game is pretty solid and looks great, I've only been playing a few hours and I've encountered minor glitches. I'm usually very busy so I don't have much time to put into Story driven games, so something like this is perfect for me. Play a couple matches then head out to work. Just scratched the surface but I highly recommend it if you are just trying to squeeze in some game time."
3086,5,Stars for the price game itself a 2
3087,5,"Plenty of other reviews have gone into detail about this. So I will simply say that they have finally made a return to what made this series great to begin with. I really, really, REALLY want to see more of this on PS4...in fact right now that's one of the only things that would make me go grab one."
3088,5,Great game!
3089,5,Worked perfect for my PS2. I also tried them with my PS3 and they work perfect for that system as well. Great deal!
3090,5,"This is a really good controller.  It is a lot better than I thought it would be.  The only problem I have with it is that when you shake it, nothing happens.  For instance, on Mario kart 8, you cannot shake for tricks."
3091,5,my kid love it
3092,5,Works as described.
3093,5,"Excellent product, the wii graphics on my 32'' TV was very colored  and shine and the cable has good quality"
3094,5,This will go down in the books as one of the greatest of all time FPS! Why haven't you bought it yet?!
3095,5,I really enjoy this game.  I have had electronic bowling games on other devices but this one out shines them all.  The ball action is terrific = almost real.  You can hit a pin at one end and make it slide across and get a pin on the other side just like real bowling.  The sounds are realistic as well.  The power of the 3DS has helped them to provide an action packed game that will be fun over and over for years.  I highly recommend this game for the 3DS.
3096,5,Need to share
3097,5,"I bought this just for comfort but the extra battery life it a great added value, does not look so cheap like other people wrote. In my opinion it has good quality for low price."
3098,5,amazing old school game love it!!
3099,5,Great grip on these. Used mainly for my right thumb. Left thumb I used the KontrolFreek FPS Freek CQC (http://www.amazon.com/KontrolFreek-FPS-Freek-CQC-PS4/dp/B00LMHT560/) Great combo!
3100,5,Great Item !!!!
3101,5,"I have come to a point in my life when I have realized that no video game will ever truly deserve five stars.  There will always be something wrong with it that I think should be improved or left out.  That is what follow ups are for.  That being said, I don't honestly believe this game should earn five stars based on my complaints I have about it (those are coming later), however, I think compared to almost every other game out there, this one stands above most of them.

What I like:
1)  Mario is Mario and all of the successors to 64 have been fun.
2)  They added just enough to make Mario seem fresh and new again without completely trying to invent something new like they did in sunshine.
3)  Took complete advantage of the Wii's control system.
4)  A second player can help.
5)  Graphics are great for what they are.  Not a true HD gaming console, and Mario is and always will be a cartoon.
6)  The guy that says this game isn't difficult must be the best gamer ever.  I struggle now and again and I would assume that any child under the age of 12 would have slightly more difficulty than I would.  This game is meant for all ages and  I think it achieves that.

What I didn't like
1)  The camera has so many problems.  They only let you control it half the time and half of that time the control you have won't allow it to move where you want it to.
2)  Although the whole gravity thing is great, running from the top side to the bottom side wreaks havoc with the controls.  Mario runs around like a moron.
3)  The galaxy theme may have been an excuse to not create very involved and in depth levels.  When you are done with one part you rocket to another place.

So what will it take to make the follow up better.  I think it would need to be a legend of zelda like world that is completely connected instead of the disjointed feeling that the current series makes me feel.  It may also be time for us to be able to do more controlling of other characters (Luigi, Yoshi, even princess shouldn't be helpless once in her life).  It would also be nice to have a subset that involves all of these characters playing together so you can have some good four player action.  The Wii is supposed to be about family fun.  Or, add some competitive competition for the four player mode.  Surfing against eachother or racing from one end of a level to another.  Just some thoughts.

All that being said, I still am enjoying this game and I feel that I am getting my money's worth.  For the person that said this game is repetitive, pick up Assassin's Creed and then tell me what repetitive really is.  I am glad I watched someone else play that before I bought it.  What a let down.  But, I digress."
3102,5,loved it
3103,5,"this was the greatest game!!  the sound effects and graphics were perfect. the storyline fit the  mood. and i actually found myself jumping a few times cause some parts are creepy...def mad my stomach turn a little with the whole dislusional thing. but the ending is fantastic. took me completely by surprise.

THIS IS A BIG MUST HAVE!!!!!!"
3104,5,"Awesome Replacement for the Microsoft Intellipoint 3.0 from 2000 I had.  Finally a mouse not the size of a pin.  Big ass mouse, it's Orange too!"
3105,5,"I haven't played this game, very much however from what I had seen the graphics are excellent and gameplay is just what I want."
3106,5,This game is amazing; I bought this 2 years ago. I loved it so much I bought it for the pc when I sold my 360. I just wish the developers found another publisher and made a 3rd one instead of selling the IP to a terrible dev.
3107,5,"This is in the classic game format as the original Super Mario Bros, but with some updated features. I like the little dance the creatures do along with the music during the game. Best for a multi-player game though, probably more fun that way."
3108,5,Fantastic
3109,5,"the Atari 7800, was a great system that Atari produced in the mid 80s.
However, the powers that be(actually, new management that sucked)  scrapped the 7800 and kept it on ice for years  due to the famous video game crash of 1983-1984.

when the Nintendo Nes came out and revitalised the gaming industry  Atari took notice, and revamped the 7800  to compete with Nintendo, and Sega which revealed their newly produced Sega Master System.  The big 3 had a fight on their hands....it didn't last though...

sega, did well but not enough..then the 7800 didn't sell all that well either.  I for one have all these  systems still and enjoy them all. But the Atari 7800 was special.

The 7800 was the first system to offer backwards compatibility with  the HUGE atari 2600 catalog..a 5200 adaptor was produced  but never released (its a shame)  this was a big plus for me in getting a 7800.
 they also produced a keyboard  that was later scrapped. they kept this idea for the ill fated atari Xe system that came in the late 80s..

 the 7800 boasted good graphics and sound, that rivaled the master system, as well as early NES titles. the european version had joypad controllers which are far better than the hand aching joystick controllers that came with the us versions.

The 7800 had great ports of arcade classics such as Donkey Kong, Ms Pac-man, Joust, and my favorite Galaga ..as well as some originals such as scrapyard dog)ataris take on the mario series)

its a gaming system, that fell victim to poor marketing,  but if you got one  you know that it was great.  its pretty easy to get these days,  if your a collector..pick one up  you'll be glad you did.

Have YOU played Atari today?"
3110,5,A must have for your PS4. The included ports and charging station is great.
3111,5,"Fast shipping, and very reliable!"
3112,5,Excellent
3113,5,it is a good wheel to use while playing the game becouse when you play u feel like you really riding the car
3114,5,"Yes I got both black2 and white2....I'm stupid, Nintendo take all my money but I still love their games.

By the way, my black2 was brought in Japan on the release day.(I'm Chinese and I made my travel plan to Japan base on the pokemon relase day) When I was in a huge line with all Japanese friends holding either a ds/3ds playing pokemon and wait for the new one come out, we start talking about why everyone in the world love pokemon so much.

I believe all pokemon fans have been asked the same question, Some people think the game have poor graphics and ""naive"" game style. They never truly understand what's fun in this game. Usually, I asked them to take a little bit of time and play the game. most people will understand why in short time.

Pokemon is just fun! For lite gamer, it has all cute pokemon and you feel relationships with them are real. even beat through the story is fun. If you are hard core gamer, no problem, Pokemon have the most creative, most competitive and most interesting battle system, and the battle tactics has always developed. pokemon is for everyone.

Now Let me talk about Black/white2

it is still gen5 of Pokemon series, if you know what that means...
It means, it is not a NEW Pokemon game. It is like yellow, you playing on basically the SAME map.

but, that story happened two year after black/white, there will be place that you know, but VERY different in details. a lot of ice is going to make secret pass which do not exist in b/w1. And just like it all time: the soundtracks are amazing!

This time when you are playing, you can catch old pokemon in the very beginning (if you remember in b/w1 you can only meet new pokemons before you beat N).

Of course there are new legendary Pokemons. All of them are awesome.

The story, for the reason to not blow the fun, I will not talk about the story. Everyone knows even pokemon game never actually have a big story, the b/w1 still made a lovely story which it much better that the old four generations. characters like N gave me a huge impact... B/W2 have the same stage, so you will enjoy the story just like b/w1. If you are huge pokemon fan and you want to know more pokemon story wise, there is a manga called ""Pokemon special"" that I huge recommend.

some weakness about b/w2:
1: Nintendo decided to make this game still, on the ds. So the graphic dis not improve. Personally, I'm super excited for a new pokemon game on 3DS. Hopefully release next year 2013.

2: They still didn't bring back the following pokemon like heart gold and soul silver did. I do not understand why.

3: The character we used in b/w 1. Did not have huge impact to the story.

Overall, B/W2 has all I expect to see, 5 star no question."
3115,5,"The sound is amazing, with no annoying Hiss Wireless Headsets suffer. But, they suffer the First generation Syndrome...They are Bulky and Heavy. I have Short Hair, I guess a small head, lol...When I would tilt my head back or forward they would slide off. Im not sure if they have a safety volume limit; i tend to leave it on high volume too much, I ended up with headaches. I had to return them, But I'll never forget that they were the best Headphones ever! I guess I'll wait for the Slim Version..."
3116,5,I have already played Dragon Age a while back and beaten it along with the expansion and Dragon age 2. But I decided to but this edition to play all the extras as I wait for the next game I want to play come out. If your thinking of buying Dragon Age then you should most deff buy this edition. For very cheap youe get all the extra's for basically nothing which if you don't rush throught the dlc's they could add 5 hours to just the origional Dragon Age then plus another 3 to 4 hours for the others so this is a great deal especially if you get is used because you download it from a disc instead of xbox live. So great deal and great game and worth the mony.
3117,5,Ok
3118,5,"Awesome Game. Shocked by low ratings coming out of all the game reviewers but that is just the way it goes. I personally thought it was highly innovative: blurring the line between video and game play, mixing the two mediums seamlessly into one great experience. Basically there is a movie in the game, and you play for a while and then watch movie clips of about 30 minutes in between sections. Plus the guy from Game of Thrones is great in this. My only beef with it was it was WAY, way too short. I finished it very fast, and I am a SLOW game player. There should have been more movie at the end, and more game play throughout. But still it was a 5 star for fun nonetheless."
3119,5,Awesome arcade racer ! Works on an American ps4. The menus and dialogue are not in english so a little tial and error will be necessary to navigate menus. Pretty cool soundtrack but it doesn't have running in the 90s.
3120,5,I LIKE IT....IT'S FUN
3121,5,"If you played PJM on PS3, this is a perfect translation to the PSP platform. For a mere $10, you get 30+ levels along with new towers! This game is also available for download from Playstation Store as well for the same price of $10. Highly recommended!!!"
3122,5,"This headset is amazing. I snatched it up for cheap during a sale, and I have no looked back. Not only do I sound clear, but it is a headset with surround sound. I mute the television, because all I need is this headset. The sound quality is amazing on it also. It's not just run of the mill cheap headphones, no, it's comparable to Sol Republic headphones that I own. The one thing I was worried about before I bought it was the wires. You simply just hook it us to two things and the cord is so long it's almost like it's wireless. The only negative I've found about these is that they feel like they're going to break, but I don't care about that because I treat them nice, and whenever they did happen to fall from my study desk to a concrete floor, they survived with nothing wrong. Highly recommended!"
3123,5,It's i the game not something else and it came fast also the game was well protected and it wasn't damaged
3124,5,Love it
3125,5,Perfection!
3126,5,Truly a great game! you can expect excitement at every corner! Amazing storyline and great character development for the main group. I must say that the Villain's main motive for doing what he does was not very strong.
3127,5,very good
3128,5,bought the game cause i love the series and shockingly this game is the same age as i am feel great to hold a piece of gaming history in my hands storys great every aspect of the game is great
3129,5,does whats its suppose to
3130,5,awesome game. Condition as advertised.
3131,5,Kept hearing people say this game was really good and I believed them. Just wasn't at the top of my list. I finally decided to pick it up after playing a butt load of Treasure games and getting the Hori Battlepad. This game feels old. Not as in outdated but classic. It's fast and stylish like every Treasure game. There's a PS1/N64 era charm to it. It seems like every time say Wii doesn't have anything interesting I find stuff like this. It's short but there's enough to keep you coming back.
3132,5,Mickey was very well made and a great addition to the Toy box in Disney infinity
3133,5,My son loves this game. Is having so much fun with it. He especially loves that it has been challenging to him.
3134,5,"This is possibly the greatest game I ever played.  When I went up to college, I didn't bring my Xbox 360 for security reasons, so I bought the PC version of Condemned so I could play through it a third time.  This game is so scary that even on the third play through, I jumped and screamed from time to time.  The detective work in this game is creative and fun, and despite what the other reviews say, the tools are not hard to work with.  It's simply a matter of following the arrows that are on the screen.  This game is different than all first-person shooter games out there, so it's not worth comparing.  All I can say is try this game by buying it or trying the PC demo.  Believe me, it's worth it."
3135,5,"There's not much to say that others haven't already said, but I would like to offer my opinion to the masses already here.  I have been playing the Wii since it came out, and it's still going strong.  But for the record, let me point out that you should read this review with the understanding that I am a huge Nintendo fan.  Also, I am a 22 year old Male who's been playing video games since the original NES.

The Wii is truly awesome.  The motion controls, from swinging the remote as a sword to using it as a steering wheel, make for some very exciting experiences.  Although some games don't use this feature very well (sloppy motion to on-screen translation), the ones that apply it properly are gems.  Some examples are Madworld, Mario Party 8, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart, and Wii Play.

The pointer is a huge plus.  It reads extremely well on every game I have played that utilizes this feature.  Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Zelda, Wii Play, and Red Steel are great examples of how good this can work.  Shooters, like Metroid Prime 3, are greatly augmented by being able to point and shoot with such accuracy.  It adds a realistic layer of skill to shooters that I find very immersing.

There are plenty of games that can use the Gamecube controller or Classic controller attachment instead for those that don't like the Wii controller--Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, etc.  Virtual Console downloads are awesome, as well as some of the Wii Ware games that have emerged.  Having the opportunity to download great games from the NES, SNES, NeoGeo, Sega, Turbo Grafx, etc. adds some serious value to the Wii, in my opinion.  Backwards compatibility with all GCN games is cool as well.

The Wii has frozen a few times in the middle of a game, but it's very rare.  The overall performance of the Wii is excellent.  It doesn't over heat, the electric power usage is (understandably) less than the other major systems, and its nice compact size is very appealing.

The problem that a lot of people have with this system is the ""lack"" of ""mature"" games.  I will admit that if you are into hard core shooters, the Wii is not the best system (although the Conduit might change that).  RPGs aren't very common either.  However, there are plenty of great games that older gamers can enjoy on the Wii.  For example, Zelda, Metroid Prime 3, Mad World, No More Heroes, Medal of Honor: Heroes, Super Mario Galaxy, Battalion Wars 2, Okami (a PS2 port with Motion Controls added), Resident Evil 4 (what many people consider to be the best version), Excite Truck, and others.  There are also many more coming out in the future.

To summarize my points, the Wii's controller features can be very effective when used properly.  The pointer is very efficient for shooters, the motion controls add plenty of depth, and there are some really great games for the system.  It's not going to be everybody's favorite, but it's definitely mine."
3136,5,like it.
3137,5,"This game is amazing. Everything about it. The story is one you'll never forget with an amazing plot twist. Especially if you played the first BioShock. The characters are well developed as well, and they interact well. The gameplay is pretty great, although Vigors are NOT as useful as Plasmids were in the original. The DLC is worth every penny. There is more amazing story if that's what you like, or there's just a DLC for more gameplay and such."
3138,5,Great article if you don't want something too heavy!
3139,5,"This is a great game!  You will never regret buying this.  Play as Homer, Bart, and other great characters from the game.  The graphics have defiantly improved and the gamepaly is extremely exciting.  The first missions are very easy untill you get up to the higher levels.  I am currenlty stuck on the collect the 30 monkeys in under 3 minutes.  It is very fun just to rampage through the game with destroying everything insight if you are fed up with the missions.  I do warn you though, you have to keep a strict eye on your hit&run meter which goes up when you hit things after you meter gets into the red zone the police start to chase after you.  But what is the point in knocing things over then you ask.  Well first off they make the cars very hard to control when going at high speeds and secondly when you knock things over you get coins which let you buy things, (such as clothes for Homer and for if you get caught by the police where you half to pay a 50 coin fine.  The story line is pretty dumb but that doesn't really matter with this game.  I do warn you though, do not get this game for PC unless you are an admin otherwise you cant save your game.  This is the best of all Simpson games with more things to knock over and better motives for tasks."
3140,5,"It does rock. People are complaining it's the same as wii, but really? It's suppose to be! It's for us Play Station lovers that don't want to a buy a wii. The songs are awesome and the dances are fun. 3 takes Just Dance 2 out of the water. It's great game for parties and on your own unlike that one everyone is comparing it too. But seriously check it out. I love the Just Dance games. It's about shaking your butt and having fun with people, not all the bull the so called gamers rate it on."
3141,5,A fun game to pass the time.
3142,5,This thing is amazing. Easy to install and my Xbone is running faster and smoother than it ever has. 5/5
3143,5,"If you loved Shadow of the Colossus, you owe it to your self to play this title. Very well designed with challenging puzzles. I still play this game occasionally on my PS3.

If you have a PS2 or PS3, you HAVE to give this game a try.

Also, the game ""Shadow of the Colossus"" is also very good and follows the series."
3144,5,One of the best headsets that I have ever had. The sound quality is amazing. Extremely comfortable. It does not make my head hurt after extensive use 8+ hours. Way better than turtle beach. The low price makes it sooo worth it.
3145,5,Works great especially if you have the tv tuner hooked up.
3146,5,This is one of my favorite games.  I love using the different factions to take over the universe.  Great game play.  Download the mod and it even gets better.
3147,5,"Fantastic grips. I found the rubber on the DS4's sticks to be too slippery, and these absolutely solved the problem. Hell, my friend liked them so much that he bought the second pair off of me."
3148,5,best game ever
3149,5,"Mouse cord never snags anymore!  Once you get it to the proper length you desire this thing is awesome.  Beats taping your desk, I have an IKEA galant and have ripped paint off when changing out the electrical tape i used to use.  Now this bungee sits right on top of that imperfection!"
3150,5,"Many gamers (and reviewers on this site) have said that the GTA series couldn't be matched for its innovative style and free-roaming play.  So what happens when you take a GTA-style scenario and virtually cross it with the real-world situation of Operation Enduring Freedom?  You get the new game Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction.

In this game, you play as one of 3 mercenaries who have been chosen for a special mission: A United Nations-like group has to stop a madman in North Korea named Song who has control of a very powerful nuclear arsenal targeting the world. An unprecedented $100 million dollar bounty has been placed on Song's head and the heads of 51 other compatriots known as the ""Deck of 52"" (see how this relates to real world situations?)  You are dropped into the country and your search for Song begins.

Your job is to make contact with the factions in the area and try to gather the intelligence information needed to take down the Deck.  The first 12 ""cards"" in each suit are pretty much open season, meaning as you travel around the map to complete your missions if you see anyone of them in the area, you can take them down to collect their bounties and use the money for supplies, but keeping in mind that killing them gives you only half the bounty.

But for the 4 ""Aces"" you need to collect enough intel to gain special clearance to go after them, and trust me it won't be as easy as you would think.

Graphics are not really all that bad for this game but be honest, would you really care about the graphics when this game gives you virtually free reign to shoot any weapon, take any vehicle that is near you and destroy anything and EVERYTHING that is in your path?  COME ON!

All in all, this is one Playground that you definitely will want to play in..."
3151,5,"I must say, this game is really beautiful.  The stages are busy with background characters.  The cut scenes are nicely done.  The characters look great.  The voice acting is awesome.  It really is a great game.

The story mode is great, especially for a fighting game.  You get to fight with a few of the older characters, but are also introduced to fresh new characters.  Most of them are children of, or at least kin to the other characters.  The older characters are just that, older.  It's nice to have a game that is almost 25 years old, have characters finally look like they are close to 25 years older.  The story picks up right after MK 9, and pulls you in from there.

The fighting in this game is very similar to Injustice:  Gods Among Us.  The game allows you to interact with the background, using boards, people and other things to your advantage.  This go around they have added a few QTEs.  They're spread out enough that you don't get board with them.  Actually, I looked forward to doing them.  Most of the characters specials are the same as in the earlier games, so you will be comfortable straight from the start.  The options button brings up the menu for the controls so you can learn the move sets easier.

I've played through the story mode and it does keep your attention.  After you play, stay for the end credit movie.  I will say this about the story mode.  It introduces some characters with little to no background on them.  Some seemed to be rushed.  Others just disappear with no real reason as to why.  It's still good, but sort of leaves you wondering.

This game has a lot of characters from the get go.  A lot of older faces return, mixed with the new younger crowd.  If you bought this as a pre order, you can play as Goro.  As most have heard, you will be able to buy more characters -- looks to be about $30.  Not sure what all comes with the DLC, so I'll keep my opinion on that to myself.  I know that Jason Vorhees and the Predator are part of that DLC.  It'll be interesting to see how they fight, their specials and of course the fatalities.

That's one thing that I don't really like -- the fatalities.  A lot are really good, others just seem to be sort of repetitive, or at least very similar.  They're of course as gruesome as ever, but almost seem to be repeats of earlier games.  There are several videos on YouTube, so you can watch them to see which ones you like.

I will caution this.  When I put the disc in and it downloaded, it added the update.  Once the game started, a few seconds after it got to the main menu, it crashed.  The PS4 said that the Mortal Kombat App crashed and had me send a report.  It did this 3 times.  I deleted the game, and re-downloaded everything.  Again, it crashed.  Finally, I got it to work.  Not sure why this happened.  I was able to play the story mode with no problems and also play a Tower game this morning.

Overall, I would say this is one of, if not the best MK game out."
3152,5,This game is addictive and really fun. Customize the character and upgrade armor is sweet.
3153,5,Great game
3154,5,Great product
3155,5,"Ever wanted to run your own business? Like business simulations? Then this is the game for you!!! This is the best Business simulation I've ever seen. Start-up 2000 and The Corprate Machine do not even compare. Capitalism 2 is extremely cusomizable and has very few unrealistic limitations, which makes it one of the most realistic Business games ever. You can be a manufacturer, a retailer, a real estater, or invest stock on your other componies, or all ok it!!! This game is so in depth you'll confuse it for reality. You can make a custome game, or play a game with an ultamite goal, such as reach a profit of $20,000,000 a month in 10 years. The compeditors are usually agressive a cunning, but sometimes make dumb mistakes, like everybody does. Unlike most games out there, you can sell almost anything you can think of. From Canned Corn and Ice Cream, to Stereos, DVD players, and Cars. You can even sell what your compeditors make, as they do to you. So everybody makes money. You can also invest stock, decide how much to pay yourself, set divendins, and have other people buy your stock and your compeditors. It is imposible to tell you how realistic this game is. A little advice. Start building and sellinh simple at the beggining of the game. Palm Computers take a lot to make and take a while before they make money. Start with small stores selling seaport imported products and products you can make simply.
Pros: REALISTIC, CUSTOMIZABLE, SMART AI
Cons: AI sometimes, yet rarely rediculously dumb, You'll be adicted forever!!! Muhahahaha!!!
Final Verdict: Currently the closest thing to a real business for a dirt cheap price!! BUY IT TODAY!!!"
3156,5,"Brawl has amazing upgraded graphics from Melee along with a new adventure level that actually has a lot more adventure than Melee. There are a lot of the same events, however, you can also play demos of the older original games that these characters come from. There are a lot of beautiful unlockable trophies and all new events that make the game stand out from the last. Brawl has wonderful fixes that got rid most of the previous game's lag time between button to attack. The one downside I find to this game is that Gannon (a playable character) has gotten slower, weaker, and has less range. You do not get to play as Pichu or Mewtwo in this game.

Playable characters are:
Link
Zelda/Sheik
Gannondorf
Donkey Kong
Diddy Kong
Pit
Kirby
King Dedede
Meta Knight
Samus/Zero Suit Samus
Fox
Wolf
Lucas
Ike
Pikachu
Jigglypuff
Pokemon Trainer (The Pokemon Trainer doesn't fight, but three pokemon do for you: Ivysaur, Squirtle, or Charizard)
Ice Climbers
Pikmin & Olimar"
3157,5,"Every year I buy FIFA and even though it always has some bugs and glitches, I love it.

Its the game I play the most and always enjoy it.

Sure EA has some areas for improvement, but that doesnt take away from the gaming experience."
3158,5,"Let me start off by saying...I LOVE THIS GAME!!! I love ameusment parks in general, and have tried Carnival Games (LOVE IT) and WonderWorld Amusement Park (HATED)...so I gave this one a try.  At first I was a little iffy about it, but once I got into it, I loved it!  I love the ADVENTURE mode, doing all the tasks...trying to gain more ""stuff"".  Some of the missions are extremely easy to mildy challenging.  But there are so many it seems as if it will take forever to complete them all!! The main ""story"" is to open up Funville part of the park, and let me tell you (without giving too much away) as soon as I was able to open that land, all of a sudden my missions have gotten really hard!!  And I love it!! (Right now I neeed to find someone who used to be a sports star so they can get their picture taken...I for the life of me cannot figure who that is!!).

Please know before buying that you can just walk around and play the mini games if you want...but the main draw is the missions you need to do...and that can take hours of your time.  I swear I play and don't even realize that I was playing for HOURS...I have to force myself to put down my remote and spend time w/ the family!!!!

I myself enjoy all the mini games, some alot more than others.  The graphics are great, I laugh at the gibberish talk (why so many people complain about mundain stuff boggles my mind) and the story line is alot of fun. Definitaly recomend if you have the time!!!"
3159,5,It works at keeping games and memory cards together. The key hole in conjunction with the key chain wires I bought has been beneficial.
3160,5,Awesome graphics!!!!!!!!
3161,5,Works great for what I use it for. Way better than the RFU adapter I've been using. I highly recommend this if you're looking to get some use out of your old PS2!
3162,5,"Best mouse Ive gotten so far, looks amazing with the BO3 mousepad as well! It tracks amazingly, and for those that are curious, the mouse wheel is the ONLY thing that lights up! It looks so clean!"
3163,5,Fast shipping and it works just fine.
3164,5,"Before I get into the meat of this review, let me start by telling everyone what 'Sins' is and isn't... This game is a space-based 4x-type (eXplore-eXpand-eXploit-eXterminate) realtime strategy game. This game is not Master of Orion, Homeworld or Medieval: Total War (in space)...

So with that said, I'll continue...

Sins of a Solar Empire, or simply 'Sins', is a new strategy offering by developer Ironclad Games utilizing their propriety 'Iron' engine and published by our friends over at Stardock. Stardock has become famous the world over for their excellent gaming and productivity software, developing and releasing suck products as Galactic Civilizations 1 and 2, Windowblinds and Object Desktop. Stardock has become quite admired by many in the gaming community (including myself) for their stance on the use of DRM software. For this reason alone, a lot of gamers have given their products a try and the result has been a truly great developer-gamer relationship.

Whereas the Galactic Civilizations franchise effectively 'rebooted' the turn-based 4X experience that was left dying on the vine after the Master of Orion 3 fiasco, Ironclad clearly set out to go a step further create an RTS game that had all the excitement of realtime play with all the depth and tactics of a great strategy game. For the most part, I think Ironclad knocked one completely out of the park!

The game features 3 distinct races of a somewhat familiar format. The TEC (Trade Emergency Coalition) are the Terran race of the game, the Advent are the psychics, and the Vasari are the wunderkind advanced tech race. A typical game scenario has two or more races/players fighting against each other for military, economic and cultural control of a star system.

Where the game really shines is in it's use of the new 'Iron' engine, which allows you to seamlessly scale in and out of the action a-la Supreme Commander. You also have full 360 degree camera control, allowing you to focus in as far as an individual starfighter at any angle, or out far enough to see the entire star system. Although there are technically 3 dimensions of actions, the gameplay really focuses on only 2 dimensions and this is where Homeworld fans might be slightly dissapointed.

The overall format and gameplay are very remniscent of Ubi Soft's earlier Conquest: Frontier Wars in many ways,which I enjoyed a great deal. The combat in both games is similiar, with ships being of the rock-paper-scissors variety that encourage a combined arms approach to ship combat. But Sins takes this formula and totally runs with it. In addition to the scalable interface and RTS gameplay, Sins comfortably integrates in cultural, trade and research elements that fit well and provide another great dimension to the game.

Another thing the developers chose to add in the game are space pirates. On Stardock's official Sins forum, it already appears as though people either love or hate the pirates. Pirates in Sins provide you (and your opponents) with what are essentially mercenaries that can be hired to attack your opponent. The player that bids the most money in a given time period is essentially spared a pirate attack on one of their systems while their enemy is forced to fend them off. Pirates as an offensive threat can be eliminated however by detroying their well-fortified homeworld. At first I was annoyed by the inclusion of space pirates, but after getting used to planning for their use and attacks, I have to say I've grown to love that element of the game too.

One thing that I noticed quickly that was completely missing from the game was ground combat. Instead of building transports to haul troops in to invade a planet, you basically have to bombard a planet until it's a dustball and then 'colonize' it. This is the one big thing that I thought Ironclad could have done better, but even with this omission 'Sins' is still far superior to many of its contemporaries.

The bottom line:

Pros: Realtime gameplay, scalable interface, beautiful fleet battles, excellent tech integration, cool ships/races, no DRM, and Stardock is the publisher!

Cons: No ground combat, pirates are a slightly annoying element, combat can be slow and bland at times.

Final Word: If you love RTS or general strategy games, pick this one up. To not play it would be to miss out on an early contender for strategy game of the year!"
3165,5,plays just like the first edition
3166,5,likes it
3167,5,"I've played lots of games on the psp--including God of War, Crash of the Titans, and Daxter--but Dead Head Fred is still my favorite!

There are mini games galore, a great story line, loads of places to go items to find and creepies to kill.

This is great adventure game, and it takes awhile to finish.  If you get stuck there are some wonderful walkthroughs online. It's a game I like to replay; and since I usually sell them after I finish playing them once, That's saying a lot!"
3168,5,"This is another gem that completely surprised me.

The game's progression is nothing groundbreaking. You defeat enemy strongholds for XP and to conquer a geographic area. With XP you upgrade yourself and your vehicle. Once the area and its central stonghold are secured then that area becomes a safe haven.

Your health comes exclusively from two very rare items: food and water. Some water can be carried, but food is consumed where found, so you have to plan for how much damage you'll take. Restarting the game will not refill your health. The strongholds will usually have some food and water on-site but you'll need to survive one or two waves of enemies before you can get to their locations.

While the mechanics aren't new, it's the way that this progression plays out in a post-Apocalyptic Australian Outback that made me wish the game never ended. As you can expect, there is considerable driving along with the endless quest to upgrade your car, but the driving was intuitive. The car gained perks that allowed it to inflict more harm on the enemy or to flee when overwhelmed.

Sharing equal time with the combat driving is the melee combat. The parry button is critical to your melee successes but there are no complicated combos to remember. The shotgun and sniper rifle have there uses but most of the combat is hand-to-hand. I tend to not like melee games as much as shooters but this one was most enjoyable.

If you pick up this game, make sure that you conquer Jeet's area first and fully upgrade his stronghold. There are other areas that follow the same pattern but you want at least one location where you can fast travel to get full health, ammo, fuel, and water. Folks will even pick up scrap (the game's only currency) for you while you play. I rarely hijacked enemy vehicles for stealth purposes because I wanted to keep using the harpoon on Max's car. But the enemy Dropkicker was a great car to use for taking down the convoys because I just got ahead of the pack and dropped mines on them from the back of the vehicle. That worked like a charm every time.

On a side note, Max's sidekick is a hunchback mechanic named Chumley. Now that was some damn good voice acting.

Can't recommend this game enough"
3169,5,"After such a wait Blizzard Entertainment has been able to conquer the software World of Role-playing again.  Diablo II is not only entertaining to play but also very realistic.  The scenes and details (shadows, background noises, creature attacks, etc.) were some of the best I played.  The playability of the game was very understanding and easy to get use to. I used two characters on my excursion to kill Diablo.  I used the Paladin and the Sorcerer.  I found that the Paladin had an easier time to kill and move forward in the game. Although he did not have the combination spells' which that made the sorcerer fun. The 1st scene of the game, Rogue Encampment, was a time to understand the various new tools and capabilities that the game had to offer.  As I mentioned I had some trouble getting use to the sorcerer. The Paladin plowed through the levels. The quests and the way that they lead in the game were intuitive. The 2nd scene, Lut Gholeim, was very impressive in the desert.  The method that Blizzard changed the scenery was very creative compared to the previous version.  Instead of going lower and lower in the ground they kept the game above the surface. I liked the fact that you can speak to more people, who gave you hints on how to play the game and find new items. I will not give the whole game away but I must say that if you want to finish the game fast play with the Paladin, or if you prefer a challenge then go with the Sorcerer. Have fun !!"
3170,5,"great game.  short but well made laid out campaign, and great online play. probably not worth the money if you don't have online play as single player mode can be finished in a few hours"
3171,5,"This game is a ton of fun to play.  If you've played any of the previous versions, you'll feel at home, although there are many changes here.  The animations and controls feel better and more realistic, and the graphics are solid.  There is amazing depth in this game, especially in Dynasty mode.  You are in control of everything, and EA puts a ton of information at your fingertips.  Nice additions: the weekly Sports Illustrated Covers/headlines really make it feel realistic; the EABio feature allows you to earn rewards for playing other EA games (any of them!) and grants you a player level; the recruiting and off-season is incredibly fun and could be a simulation in and of itself; although no names appear (NCAA regulations), you can enter the names yourself, and the broadcasters have hundreds of names recorded (all the major stars).  Well worth the money!"
3172,5,"I purchased, over the past two years, all of the sims 2.  I now found out its free ..all of the sims 2 on Origin.  But I would have bought them anyway, but advise not to get ripped off since these are now offered for free.  I love them, and they beat out sims 3 and the latest bummer sims 4.  I still play 2, and enjoy it a lot, and find it absolutely inconceivable how sims has turned into a big rip off.  I wonder who was the team that put together Sims 2, because its fantastic, and there won't be anything like it,or better,  at least it doesnt seem so, in the near future. Which is a shame. Its just great!"
3173,5,These are a must have for any PS3 owner.  The L2 and R2 buttons on the PS3 controller are terrible and these put them right on par with the Xbox 360 triggers.
3174,5,Great Price for a Fun  Game! I got the kids a New 3DS for Easter and my Son always plays angry birds on my phone he Loves this game!
3175,5,awesome game
3176,5,chows our man
3177,5,"It's got it fair share of issues but this was one of my sleeper hits for 2012.

The fighting added a breath of fresh air to the sandbox GTA genre. The voice acting was also nicely done and there are plenty of missions to keep you busy. The storyline is also really interesting, having to play as both good cop and undercover gang member. I've since sold my Xbox buy I'm looking to pick it up again on the next Steam sale and go through it more thoroughly. I just beat the main story but didn't collect everything.

Really a lot of fun and you can't go wrong with this game if you want something different than GTA."
3178,5,Based om the cult movie of 1979 the Warriors video game events take place 3 months before the events of the movie.  The gameplay is easy to pick up on first you take control of Rembrandt the youngest of the warriors (he's one of 9 warriros you can control)  First you start off by learning the basic moves and then you move to tagging and stealing ANd mugging for which you earn money for useful items like spray paint amongst other things.  Weapons as far as they go you start out with your fists but there are numerous other things like baseball bats and hammers I have seen them all yet.  Most of the orginal cast from the movie have done the voice over work and its all very well done.  I think Rockstar toronto did a fantastic job with this game normally I'd steer clear of gmaes based on movies but I was really surprised at how well they captured the mood of the film within the game.  The following chracters in the game are not voiced by the actors who played them in the movie Snow Cowboy Rembrandt Vermin Cyrus and Luther. Overall I'd rate this 9/10.  CAN YOU DIG IT!!
3179,5,Excelent
3180,5,"MUST HAVE!!!! I am so happy they released these. I have stocked up on both the white and the black as there is no telling how much longer they will sell these. I still play GameCube games a lot on my Wii and my GameCube so it was awesome to get a new GENUINE controller in 2016!! Don't buy 3rd party ""cheap"" controllers, they just don't feel right!!...now only if they would re-release N66/SNES/NES controllers"
3181,5,Thanks A lot
3182,5,this is better than the original gameboy pacman this is just like the arcade game we all love
3183,5,Kids love the game and the music. exciting!! Its fun racing and crashing into things and driving cool cars that you can customize!!
3184,5,Good
3185,5,"This is the BESTEDEST game ever!!! I clocked over 300 hours playing Civ IV and it is really a jewel of stratagy gaming. Great for multiplier (unlike Civ V). There is no additional copies required for home LAN game as one key seems to activate the game unlimited amount of times (Thank you 2K!). Super balanced and quickly gets you addicted. You may have to join One More Turn Support Group to deal with your addiction, but its worth it. The Collection comes with all of the expansions which I really recommend since they fix some of the unbalances of the original game.

Colonizations is a sad sad game... So think of it as a free something. It is more of a mode then a stand alone game, is poorly tested and has really big issues with balance and routing."
3186,5,It would have been great if it came with a memory stick since it doesn't come with internal memory for anything other than system settings. To hold me over I purchased a 4 gig from a respectable seller from Amazon. Other than the memory everything about it is perfect.
3187,5,"This works great and was really cheap. May not be a name brand, but works just as good as the name brand ones. I highly recommend buying this."
3188,5,Got this for free haven't played this game in a while but I've started again. It came with free aq coins as well
3189,5,Great
3190,5,"I like this purchase it is very fast and also you can redoom from ORIGIN, i like it.

thanks and best regards."
3191,5,"great buy, great service"
3192,5,thiis is a great game to play the whole family plays it some day we will beat it maybe but love it
3193,5,Great feeling mouse with great response. I really enjoy this mouse.
3194,5,"I bought this for my son last Christmas and it has worked like a trooper, I would recommend this product"
3195,5,"Works great, easy to install"
3196,5,"Played them all and I was ready for BF3. My PC: 2500k, Asus P8Z68-V Pro, 8GB Ripjaws, 1GB 5850. Blows the consoles away. I did not have any problem with install. I played Singleplayer and multiplayer four hours each on day one. Browser navigation interface takes a minute to get used to but works fine for me. I have not used the squad join or friends invite/join. I was shocked my xbox controller worked. You have to map some buttons to make it more familiar. Button presses during campaign still seem to need mouse and keyboard interaction. Other than that X360 control works perfect. Awesome game. Must have for any Battlefield fan."

3198,5,"One of the greatest games to hit the PC. Got mine on STEAM, runs great and I don't believe it contains DRM. I run it on GeForce 460 GTX SC, and have had no problems. One game in the action RPG class that stands out, an epic genre of it's own!"
3199,5,Great game. My brother loves it.
3200,5,"The P11 headset brings quality at a fair price.  It boasts many features that I look for in a headset, while keeping a good 'bang for the buck' price and not sacrificing build quality.

** THE GOOD **
- The overall design for the P11 is fairly simple yet sturdy.  The cuffs fit snug on my ears even with glasses!(soft foam earmuffs make a big difference)
- 50mm speakers are a nice addition.  You often find smaller 40mm speakers on headsets this price.
- Sound quality is exceptional.  These easily have performed better than my older Logitech headset and come close to rivaling my Sennheiser HD 515
- Control Box is simple yet efficient.  It has a MUTE button as well as MIC and GAME volume controls
- MIC MONITOR!!! Such a nice feature.  You hear your own voice in a subtle fashion so you know how loud you are talking which makes for more natural conversations
- 12ft cord is nice especially when other headsets are 6-8ft .  The extra few feet make a big difference

** THE BAD **
- No XBOX 360 support
- Frame itself is sturdy but might be prone to cracking if the headset is stressed
- Requires 2 cable hookup. While this isn't something new to the market the cable management Nerd in me goes bonkers!  Not a negative just adds to wire clutter

** THE ULGY **
- The belt clip on the audio controller feels very cheap.  Be extra careful with it

* Overall the P11 headset is a lot of bang for your buck.  It has a fairly simple setup and works for both PS3 and PC/MAC.  It brings very good quality audio to the table, larger/higher quality speakers to the mix, and a small army of features that will make any gamer happy.  If you do not own a headset this is a perfect headset for a mid-ranged user.  While it isn't top of the line you are getting your money's worth and will not be disappointed in  your purchase.

**NOTE: Setup is fairly simple.  For a PC/MAC it is plug-n-play.  Just plug the green audio cable into your sound card and then plug the USB cable in.  After drivers are automatically installed you should be set to go (you might have to manually set the computer to the headset which can be done in Device Manager > Hardware and Sound > Sound

- For a PS3 just plug the USB cable into the PS3.  The stereo adapter cables then hook up to the Audio OUT of your TV and you plug the green cable into those or you can plug the green cable into the back of the PS3 and just mute your TV.  Go into your PS3 accessory settings and change the headset output to the P11 device.  Both PC and PS3 setups are very easy to do

P11 vs PX21  what is the difference?

The P11 is the newest model from Turtle Beach and boasts some ""minor"" changes to the design.  Below is a break down so you can decide which headset is right for you

P11 = PS3, PC/MAC
X11 = 360, PC/MAC
PX21 = PS3, 360, PC/MAC (universal)

X11 and PX21 both use 40mm drivers....  P11 uses 50mm drivers and outputs a bit better bass.  The PX21 has a 16ft cord vs the 12ft cord of the X11 and P11.  The PX21 also has a flexi-MIC where as the X11 and P11 both use standard mic's.  The PX21 also has an option to adjust the Bass boost.

* So overall if you own a PS3 and 360... you want a PX21.  What it sacrifices is basically 10mm of speaker power but gives you a nice universal headset for around $10 more.  If you only own a PS3, a PC or PS3/PC then you probably should get the P11 as you end up with slightly better audio for less money.

**NOTE: If you have a ""hum/buzz"" on the speakers here is how to resolve it:
-- The audio output of GAME on the audio controller is set to high.  This is noise being picked up from the volume being to loud.  Just like turning speakers up to max w/o any audio source.  Easy way to resolve it is by lowering the master volume in windows (mine defaulted to 94 which I promptly changed to 70).  Then just adjust the GAME audio control on the clip on device until the hum vanishes.  You should still have clear, loud audio but w/o the white noise now.

**NOTE: For reference on the PC I set windows to  volume: 70 (USB headset);  my CHAT slider is about 70-80%  and my GAME slider is about 50-60%  Gives me loud, crystal clear audio w/o any noise."
3201,5,EXCELLENT
3202,5,Item arrived on time and as described.
3203,5,"The best graphics of the new gen, story is short but very good, and the online multiplayer its extremely fun, i don't know why it had such low reviews, this game its awesome, a must-buy for xbox one."
3204,5,I originally bought CQC's for my PS4 controller and loved them. I wish these were as big as the ones on my PS4 but the difference is pretty small and the quality of these sticks is fantastic.
3205,5,Huge fan of D&D video games for PC and consoles. Awesome edition to the Baldur's Gate franchise. I sincerely hope we see many more additions to the Baldur's Gate franchise in the future.
3206,5,Great game.
3207,5,Arrived fast and was as described.
3208,5,ok
3209,5,Still one of the best football games.
3210,5,"It's a shame THQ didn't allow AKI to develop there games for the PS2 as well; the ridiculous system Yukes developed for ""Smackdown!"" makes me feel like I'm playing Mortal Kombat instead of wrestling.  The AKI system provides the best wrestling simulation of all games.  The movement is accurate and believable, and the reaction the characters have after hurting a particular body part makes for a good wrestling experience.  I also particularly like the fact that there is no ""health bar"" on the AKI games.  This gives the game more of a ""give and take"" feel."
3211,5,exactly what I needed.
3212,5,Very good
3213,5,Amazing
3214,5,"I am a 19 year old game lover, and  I was looking for a nice game to play since I finished Zelda. I thought game creators were all trying to copy each other and the same regular games were being launched, without new tricks or new playability. Fortunately, I had the chance to play Conker's Bad Fur Day, with a great humor inside, nice playability, and crazy things hapening in every corner or each scene. The playability is similar to Banjo- Tooies past games, also made by Rareware. Conker is a good squirrel, easy going and ready for trouble. I recommend you try this game. Rent for a few days, and then decide if you wanna buy. This is truly a diferent one, and it will be valuable for a long time for N64 lovers."
3215,5,"I don't quite know how to describe how great this game really is...I just sat down for 15 hours straight and couldn't put the controller down until the end of the credits. This game combines everything and anything you could ever want in a movie, a game or any entertainment experience. Uncharted 2 has incredible characters, wonderful story, some of the best acting I've ever seen (Not just the voice acting, but the actual animations of the characters, their facial expressions), everything is done so beautifully I'm absolutely speechless. Among Thieves exceeded the hype in my mind, it immerses you in this incredibly detailed and lush environment, seamlessly bouncing you back and forth from gameplay to breathtaking cinematic wonder, and most often, combines them both at the same time. Just the attention to detail is astounding. I wish I had a better vocabulary so I could give this review justice but you should just see for yourself! You will not regret this purchase one bit, the multiplayer is even fun! If you own a PS3 and don't have this game, then you should sell your PS3."
3216,5,"It plays like the other hidden picture object games from POPCAP. Plus there is an extra item to find while looking for clues. You have the typical hunt for the 25  KEY's all  of them then 25 Crowns & another 25 of a clue. I love these types of games you have to look carefully before your time runs out. There are a total over 2,000 hidden objects to solve this caper. You have only 17 hours before the ransom is due and the jewels could be lost forever!
  I love playing this SERIES OF THE MYSTERY P.I. Your the hired Private Eye that has been hired to do this depends on how many hours will it take you fast or slow. I have played almost all of them. It started with  MYSTERY P.I. THE LOTTERY TICKET-THE VEGAS HEIST-THE NEW YORK FORTUNE-THE LOST IN LOST ANGELES- Are what I have already played I'm now playing this one THE LONDON CAPER I'm on level 20. The last 2 are  STOLEN IN SAN FRANCISCO & THE CURIOUS CASE OF COUNTERFEIT COVE."
3217,5,"omg this game is awesome!!!!!! i love it...much better than any other spiderman game i've ever played...and the best part is that you can change between the black and red suit...anytime you want!!!

if you liked any other spiderman game...get this you'll really thank me!

ps. make sure you have the system to run it... i didn't have any problem running it on my system (windows vista, nvidia geforce 9300m GS 512mb, intel duel centrino processer, and 4gigs:) so if you have anything like that you shouldn't have any problem."
3218,5,Very good
3219,5,"Campaign is exciting it gives the player choices not the usual ""take these guys head on"" you could stealth right pass them or take them head on snipe each one or c4 everybody just so much fun. Multilayer is complicated and not for those with just camp and shoot, its still has many players but beware after C3 came out most of the pros just play, I'm no pro by the way, but its a really fun game. period."
3220,5,"For [...], it is the best buy out there. You are not going to be disappointed. If you were an Avid PS2 or Xbox player, and your picky about graphics ,frame rate and how realistic it looks when something  blows up...then you might want to consider the Wii as a second system.
I own 19 games for the Wii... and so far have played only a handful ( I am a addict...I have to buy the latest titles...its stupid, but then its a lot cheeper than some of the toys my peers are buying, so my wife puts up with it...)
I am being honest with you, few games are as good as they could be...but I know that the best games are always the last 2 years of the systems life..
The Wii controls are great, but it really depends on how well the game developer incorperates them into the game.  Zelda is very nice...Blazing Angels is good...Excite Truck is very cool!
If you are upset because you cannot find a Wii yet...don't worry...the best games have not even hit the shelves.
I am not going to go over how fun it is and all the hype, because, its been said before...Yes, its a new experience and Non-Games Love it...but the truth is, I am still playing my GameCube more that my Wii...
And the reason is because the greatest games for the gamecube are selling for 1/3rd the price that they originally were..and these games are the best that the game cube can handle... Once there are some more mature games on the market, I am sure that I'll be useing the Wii more than my Gamecube.

Warnings:
Cooking Momma for the Wii-- Don't bother -They did not bother to get someone to translate effectively...the result? If you do something that Cooking Momma likes...she says ""Good, not mine!"" What does that mean????
MY wife is Japanese and a translator...she even admits that they should not have released it without a proper translation.
VVVONDERfool!

Marvel Aliance -I would pass, its not really good or bad, but nothing is amazing as far as using the Wii controls...etc.

SuperMonkey Ball..Not a bad game ..but not as good as the gamecube version...

Wear your safety Straps....its not an option to play without it!

Titles to watch for this year:
Mario Party 8
Metroid Prime
Super Smash Brawl
Resident Evil 4"
3221,5,Protects your device great drop mine three times no damage
3222,5,Works awesome! I would recommend!
3223,5,"There's not much to say that the others haven't

- Combat is fun, satisfying, and addictive
- Stealth is fun and done in a way where it isn't tedious
- Graphics are just amazing, truly a next gen game
- The little bonus side missions are actually fun and make the game better as opposed to other games where just they're just kinda gay and worthless
- Story is great, hidden interviews and back stories make the game all the more immersive
- design, ESPECIALLY THE SCARECROW PART was just spectacular

Couple of notes
- My only complaint, other than I wish it was longer, is that I have an older console, and do not have Xbox live so I don't get the updates. My dash was updated with this game and that's all fine and good. But the game ran kinda buggy, it would crash during some of the loading and cut scenes, this happened rarely but often enough to make me feel anxious while playing.

- People complain about the detective mode hampering the otherwise stellar graphics, I personally think the mode looks brilliant, I love seeing the skeleton outlines, I mean that just looks so cool, and you can switch views seamlessly, I think it made the gamer better and didn't hinder it at all."

3225,5,"(Updated to 4 stars)

If you like ""The New York Times"" crossword puzzles, then you are over qualified.  This game is not for you.  But for the majority of the people, this is a very fun game!  (By the way, there is a DS game called ""The New York Times Crosswords"" if that's what you prefer).
There are thousands of puzzles different levels of difficulty.
This is another brilliant game from Nintendo. Very educational.  I bought it for my 7 year old and really loves it.
It is amazing how it can recognize your handwriting whether it is uppercase, lowercase and even longhand.

You can have 4 profiles so 4 people can play at different times.
There are 3 games to choose from.  Crossword puzzle, Word Search and Anagrams.

1) Crossword puzzle has to be the main game of the three.  You can start on ""easy"" or ""medium"" level.  It gets harder as you progress.  If you get stuck, there are hints or you can request a letter to fill in a box.  Depending how you set the options.
2) Word search is a little tiny for the eyes but no less as fun.
3) Anagram is like an electronic ""Boggle"" game.  You have to write as many words you can on a given set of letters.  There seems to be something missing here.  The only way you can finish this game is to find all the possible words.  No hints like the one on crossword puzzle. So, it is likely that you get stuck because somehow there is always a word or 2 that you do not know or can not remember.

The game is played with a the stylus and DS on its side, like a little book.  Left-handed option is available."
3226,5,"Up until the release of GTA3 the concept of console games was very different.  With the exception of a few adventure RPG's, most games did not include the freedom to do what you wanted, when you wanted, in a world so realistic you'd swear you are there.  A living, breathing city world interacts around you as you carry out missions for different gangs, run from the Police, and ultimately try to stay alive.  By harnessing the power of Playstation 2, this game displays amazing graphics, and supports a high frame rate, allowing minimal slow down during game play.  And like I mentioned, you can choose to carry out missions for various organizations, or you can wander the streets in an breath taking gaming experience.  The game also includes several mini games inluding ""Vigilante"" in which you use your (stolen) Police Cruiser to chase down specified criminals in a certain amount of time, simply amazing.  But remember, this game is rated ""Mature"" meaning it includes sexual content, graphic language and extreme violence, if you have younger kids this many not be for them, but this is of course your call.  However, you would be a fool not to own Grand Theft Auto 3, a game like this should be mandatory not just for Playstation 2 owners, but all gamers alike."
3227,5,These work just as well as the more expensive ones!
3228,5,OK
3229,5,"Fire Pro Wrestling was one of the best underrated Gameboy Adavance launch titles, and now almost two years later the sequel has hit and it is just as good as the first.
Basically if you have played FIre Pro Wrestling, and are good at it, you will have no trouble picking up this title and dominating to competition.  However in the beggining you only start off with around ten to fifteen guys.  Now you still have the huge level of create a wrestler control but for the most part in order to unlock more guys you must do story mode on all three difficulty levels.  It may seem like a pain at first but you get to choose two guys to take through with you.  My first trip through was with a Create a Wrestler Named TOrnado Bomb and Anonymous.
OVerall this game is great to play if you haven't tried the series out before.  However for those who own the first there is little that is new here, except a possible challenge here or there."
3230,5,"I have small hands but still could not get prolonged play out of my vita just from cramping.  The unit is pretty heavy and the grip does add more weight, but much more playing time since my hands no longer cramp.  Some touch screen games that require you to hold the unit with one hand are the only nuisance.  Most games that use the normal controls are now a breeze.

For those of you who are waiting for the Vita Slim to come out, this accessory will not work with the newer units.  They work perfectly will all original vita models though."
3231,5,"All the best versions of Unreal and Unreal Tournament. The games work flawlessly with Windows 7 and very easy to install. There is an integrated installer to select one or more titles (which are bundled under a single launcher during install) but if you go to each game folder separately, you can install them standalone. Unreal Tournament 2004 still likes to contact the Epic master servers, but otherwise, none of these titles is too difficult to set up for LAN or internet play. Graphics still look decent and widescreen fixes for all titles are available via the internet without much fuss. A solid buy."
3232,5,Solid wheel. Fits Wii remote easily. Quality of Nintendo products is really good.
3233,5,When I first played this game it was a bit confusing but after a while you start getting hooked onto it. It's pretty long which makes it better. The storyline is that you are partners with Megaman and you can hack into the net and into other kinds of electronics. The WWW is a bad group of people who want to take over the net. You can buy data chips and equip them to Megaman so you can fight those evil viruses on the net and (if you can) stop the WWW. This is a great game with cool graphics.
3234,5,"This game is over six years old. And it beats everything I've played until now.

Firstly, though, this game is not a shoot 'em up and not Quake like. This is not Tombraider.

This game is immersive. You go into the game's environment, and you start to care about the characters in the game. You get a sense of wonder about the environments and the scenarios.

You will like this game if you like spy movies and you like games with multiple solutions."
3235,5,Good game.
3236,5,"I received the game in the combined term
the product was exactly as specified
I indicate to friends and costumers."
3237,5,"For any further clarification, please contact us"
3238,5,"big, beauty and sharming, I love this amiibo thanks"
3239,5,Scary game to play with lights off and sounds at max; almost shat myself during first few encounters.
3240,5,"Haven't played the campaign yet, so I'll update this later once I do. However I have played much of the multiplayer and can say it's definitely great."
3241,5,good gift
3242,5,"New 3DS XL: This handheld is awesome. I was very skeptical of the face tracking 3D system, since the 3D on an older 3DS just gave me massive headaches. It actually works, however. The 3D looks great and my head feels fine even after staring at the screen for an hour or two. It's a great game system all around.

This model: The case looks absolutely beautiful."
3243,5,"Pro Skater 3 will provide you with hours of fun. There are all kinds of awesome tricks to pull off,cool hidden characters,some great levels,nice game modes,cheats,bad ass music soundtrack and more. You can also edit skaters. Such as changing their clothes,boards and other things...plus you can even create your own skater. Overall,if your looking for a great skateboarding game for the ps2,then pick this up. You will really enjoy it."
3244,5,Great!
3245,5,"It's rare I write a review for a game.  I just got done beating dead space and I feel a strong need to spread the news on how awesome this game is.  Before I wrote this review I went and read the single star reviews, because I couldn't understand how anyone could not like this game.  So before considering this game further you need to consider some basic things.  Do you like action games?  Do you like scary games?  Do you like space?  Did you like Resident Evil 4?  If you answered no to any of those you may end up rating this game as a single star.  If you answered yes to most or all of those you should probable get this game.  Let me now go into some details.

This game plays a lot like resident evil 4.  The variety of feelings you get from the game range from creepy suspense to adrenaline pumping fights.  The environments in the game are very well designed and often times very creepy.  The enemy design could have used some work but given this game relies on dismemberment as the main way to dispatch enemies there aren't a whole lot of different ways to take the enemy design.  The storyline wasn't really that impressive but the delivery was very nice.  The graphics in this game are excellent aswell as the sound.  The mission variety for the game is somewhere in the the middle.  You do alot of the same kind of missions traveling around the ship, however from time to time it's mixed up with something different.  The achievements for the game are also very nice, nothing out of the ordinary. The game lasted me around 12 hours on medium, which is short in my opinion, but I intend to go back and the get the achievement which I am guessing will take another 18 or so hours. In conclusion, the game may not have the best story and the graphics may be to par with other games of next generation console; but the game play, the environments, and the variety of missions make this game a must buy."
3246,5,"Big Surprise from Disney! The last 2 reviewers compared it to Pure. I bought Pure after playing the demo, and actually didn't see what was special about Pure as compared to the demo. Pure was just the demo with similar environments, and not much added. I was expecting to see the same with Split Second, but saw that the developers weren't so lazy this time. The S/S demo features a car which is a lower end car, in which drifting is difficult, and not very fun. In the complete game, you are rewarded cars that are easier to handle through drifting, and makes more sense. The tracks (not in the demo) also make drifting more conducive.
There are 72 races in this game with 12 episodes and 6 races for each episode, some with new environments. There will be a couple of different challenges you have to complete to move onto the next episode. In one of the more fun challenges, you must pass semi-trucks while they are dumping barrels of oil, and avoid the oil barrels. The other main challenge featured is an elimination mode, in which the car in last place gets eliminated when the timer hits zero.  Some of the other challenges require no drifting, and focus on avoiding hazards which actually brings a new type of racer to the game. The challenges are various, and much more fun than I expected.

(There is also a 2 player mode which offers a split screen, but I haven't played in this mode to comment on it.)"
3247,5,"Not many people like games theses' but I give 100% honest true about this game; the battle system is super fun and storyline is good but with the time limit clock is holding users back from all the real fun like side quest. You much use your time wisely but you should be able to beat the game without guild book if you understand system.

Game graphics are nicely done but wish the battle would take place on the field and we'll get that on FF15 coming soon. Overall Game is fun and will keep you busy while pushing you to the limit. Being able to change light style is awesome and making her do funny things will make you lol a lot."
3248,5,great game. good condition very pleased with my purcharse.(lol i sound so generic)
3249,5,Great video game!
3250,5,as promised
3251,5,thank you i can now play my xbox on my new Tv
3252,5,"If you like Action RPGs, chances are you will enjoy this game.  Brotherhood of the Blade gives you a Diablo-like perspective and game-play with out overwhelming options.  You get the standard level points to distribute, and spell points to allocate between different spells and attributes (similar to the spell tree in Diablo II).  Once you get used to the controls, the gameplay is pretty easy (although I have yet to master assigning different spells on the fly.  You assign two spells at a time, but if you want to use a third spell...well, it takes a little manuvering, and when you're in a pinch, it's a little difficult).  Overall, it's a fun game.  And like all games of this type, it's even more fun to link up with other players for multiplayer action.  Personally, I think this was probably the best launch title, or at least tied for first with Burnout Legends.  Who knew launch titles could actually be good.  Imagine what will come next."
3253,5,"This definitely makes entering in information easier, and it's especially useful if you sign onto MSN from xbox live. I bought this when I got my Xbox because it sounded pretty nice and I like it a lot. You can attach your headset to it also. It's very easy to type with this because it's just a tiny qwerty keyboard that you can use with just your thumbs."
3254,5,"All 5 worked, nice and sturdy. This is what the 3DS XL should have come with! These stretch out long enough to be comfortable for any size hand, and they don't bend or flex when pressing on the screen. I only needed 1, the rest are just a bonus."
3255,5,"This was one of the vita titles I really wanted to play when I didn't have a vita. SO glad I did! Very fun side-scrolling ARPG that takes you on a nostalgia trip back to the arcades of the 90s where these kinds of games were the hotness. Gameplay is solid and fun, sound design is great, story is...there (haven't gotten far enough to make an informed opinion). The art style is incredible, the definition of eye-candy. Every scene and animation is buttery smooth and insanely detailed."
3256,5,"This game is awesome, Not a scratch on it."
3257,5,"It does come with it's case and instruction blocket. It works perfectly and it won't have any damages. I recommend it, although it arrived a day late, still it is worth it."
3258,5,OK
3259,5,This game is so cute and so fun! Took me a little to get use to the controls but once do its easy! Totally fun tracks and obstacles. Me (29) my daughter (8) my dad (57) enjoy playing this together! If you enjoy cute fun racing games this is a must buy!
3260,5,"One major note on my review is I don't play online and my review is based on offline, single player experience. So with that being said, I'm just going knock out the few dislikes I have of the game.

1. While there are a lot of fun, creative, and entertaining ways to kill zombies, most are impractical (mostly due to time to hunt down the correct parts to make the weapons) while trying to do all the missions in single player story line mode.

2. The games internal clock mechanic. I like the idea of being on a time schedule cuz it is creative and different. I just wish the minutes would pass by slower so I had time to do all the side missions, make more weapons, and KILL MORE ZOMBIES!

3. Psychos are annoying, not extremely hard, but at times just annoying with repetitive dialogue.

Ok with this being said, it sounds like I really don't like this game but in fact I love it for its fun, original, silly, zombie killing mayhem! If the 72 hours would last a bit longer, you'd have more time to mess around with the weapons, costumes, and slaughter more zombie masses! In my first time play through, I was able to kill all the psychos, save all the people, and achieve a S rating. This game is a lot of fun, it's really nothing like I have played before. Is it hard? No not really. I think the biggest challenge is managing your 72 hour clock. You get to choose what you want to do, and has some affect on the your end game rating. Buy it, kill zombies and have a blast! Its original and creative. It's a breath of fresh air in an industry of dull, been done 100 times over copy and paste games."
3261,5,"One of my most memorable moments from graduate school in the early 90's was sitting in the computer lab after hours playing Castle Wolfenstein with my fellow grad students. You'd run your character around a corner, blow some other character's head off, and immediately hear a real person somewhere across the room curse out loud at no one in particular, because no one knew who they were shooting at, or who was shooting at them. It was primitive by today's standards, but the multiplayer aspect was unlike anything I'd ever experienced at that time, and I new the world was in for a revolution in computer gaming.

However, after playing Wolfenstein for a few weeks, I was bored enough by the repetitive nature of the first person shooter (FPS) genre to stay away from it for a decade. A few years ago I tried Quake III because of the fabulous reviews, but that took less than one day to bore me, and I fully expected to stay away from FPS's forever.

So it was with some hesitation that I purchased Far Cry in November 2005. The main reason I bought it was for the graphics. I just liked the idea of being able to roam around beautiful South Pacific islands, since I doubt I'll get to do that in real life anytime soon. If the game itself proved even remotely interesting, then so much the better.

Imagine my surprise then, when I found myself completely immersed in this game from the very beginning. The grahpics were extraordinary, the gameplay was smooth, the controls were easy to learn, and the AI offered a fair challenge, such that I really felt like I was living the story. That's what a good film should do, and that's what a good role-playing or strategy game should do. I didn't even realize I was playing a first person shooter until about midway through. And by then I didn't care. Far Cry is an amazing game!

The game is based on a sci-fi storyline in which you learn that a mad doctor with a seemingly endless supply of mindless henchmen (mercenaries) has hatched a plot that threatens humanity. It's a stale formula, yes, but the story in Far Cry is actually quite unique and riveting.

Like Kings Quest, Star Control, and the Command & Conquer series, Far Cry has established itself as a classic game that I will never forget. Enough has been said about details of the story and gameplay in other reviews. Suffice it to say that I recommend this game without hesitation--especially at the discount prices available now (I vowed long ago never to pay more than 20 bucks for a game again, even if I must wait until they are three years old!)

Be aware that there is no Save Game function, but the game saves itself using ""checkpoints"" at logical breaks in the storyline. This works well for the most part, but sometimes it requires you to go through the same long scenario many times before you finally reach the next checkpoint. On the bright side, you are free to do things differently each time, and you'll get different reactions from the mercenaries when you do. For example, I attacked one camp unsuccessfully about 10 times before accomplishing my goal, and I had to start quite a ways away from the camp each time. So I tried reaching the camp from different directions to spice it up, and eventually found best way to get the job done. The freedom to do things differently made it much less tedious to essentially do the same thing 10 times.

One thing that is missing is a greater abundance of nature sounds on the islands. In a lush tropical jungle like this, one would expect to hear all manner of birds, waves crashing, waterfalls pouring, wind howling, etc. There is some of that (footsteps are particularly good when walking through the foilage). But the immersion effect would have been even greater if the jungle sounds were as complete as the graphics or the sounds of machinery. The machinery sounds (vehicles, weapons, generators, etc.) are excellent.

The voices are well done when relating to the storyline (although the acting is pretty bad sometimes), but the mercenaries voices while hunting you down just repeat the same limited set of moronic warrior cliches, like ""I'm gonna open up a can of whoopass on you!"" Perhaps this is part of a larger joke, however, because if you look around you'll see copies of ""Redneck Today"" and ""Fully Loaded"" magazines laying around various tents.

Be sure to use the binoculars to zoom in on the mercenaries, as you'll find the detail and movement quite entertaining. For example, you can see mercs just standing around smoking cigarettes and chatting with each other through the binoculars. Using binoculars, you can also hear what they are saying, although their mouths don't really move when they are speaking.

The deus ex machina of the game is a mysterious benefactor named Harlan Doyle, who seems to know every move you make, and is able to suggest every move you should make. Perhaps it's because I played this game in 2005, but I found Doyle a hilarious character because he sounds exactly like the similar character Spottswoode in Trey Parker and Matt Stone's film, ""Team America"" (except that Doyle never asks you to unzip his pants!).

The islands really are rendered beautifully. So in addition to fantastic gameplay I got what I came for in the first place--an opportunity to walk through paradise without traveling to the South Pacific. But once you get into it, like the game warns, ""Forget paradise, this is hell!""

I haven't attempted the multiplayer mode because I only have a modem connection, but everything else in this game works wonderfully, so I have no reason to believe multiplayer isn't just as smooth.

One last thing: The game requires that CD #1 is in the drive before you can play. I've said it before and I'll say it again: software publishers should never punish their own paying customers, especially when new games retail at 50 bucks. They should locate pirates and punish them in the legal system instead, and if they don't want to go through that much effort, piracy isn't that important to them in the first place. STOP PUNISHING PAYING CUSTOMERS!"
3262,5,"I had high expectations for bioshock infinite, and I must say it exceeded them all.
I played the game three times through back to back to back over the first two weeks I had it just to get everything I could out of it."
3263,5,"He plays a lot of PS3 and just had his first child, so I bought him this so he wouldn't wake my little nephew up.  He loves it."
3264,5,Make sure to sane the connector so it will fit in the slot. Only buy this if you are replacing a Nintendo brand controller because Cirka controllers are wired together and cannot be easily replaced. The joystick had problems with some games because they require a Nintendo certed joystick. This is a must buy to replace thumb blusters and crappy joysticks.
3265,5,"Fantasy life is a great game in my opinion, a little dense in NPC dialogue and can be very overwhelming with the sheer amount of options and content available right from the start. That being said, those who enjoy games like animal crossing, harvest moon and even a little bit of skyrim will find a lot enjoyment in this game, It's quite addicting with it's many ways to play out your characters life! The graphics, for a 3ds game, are pretty top notch, with lots of brightly colored and easy to remeber areas. All-in-all I think this one of my new favorite 3DS games and if anything I have stated above sounds appealing to your tastes I highly recommend you purchase this game."
3266,5,"I really just needed another mouse and didn't look too hard at this before getting it. My gaming rig kind of has a red theme going and this guy was cheaper than even a plain black mouse at Walmart. I definitely got more than a deal. I love the design and what really got me was the fabric-esque cable. I'm not sure what all kind of technology went into that or if it's supposed to prevent tangling or fraying, but it really gives it a higher tier feel. The only downside to this is that the product registration website is non-existent. I hope that's not because it's going to fall apart tomorrow. This company seems good. I want to get into and like their stuff, but I'll have to buy more of it before I can safely say that they're awesome."
3267,5,"Graphics 5/5  Actually looks like it was made for next generation consoles and looks just as pretty as Killzone. Nighttime looks significantly better than daytime Chicago.

AI 5/5  The AI is very very smart and it makes encounters very challenging and interesting.

Driving 3/5  Walking around on foot prevails the driving by a lot. As soon as you hop into a vehicle the cit seems to turn into a ghost town. I would have wished that the driving was more like GTA5 and not Saints row. Perhaps the driving isn't the best because Aiden always has his phone out.

The first thing I notice is that this game does require you to think! In every combat situation, running in guns a blazing will certainly find you in a bit of trouble. However, if you take the time to look around, everything can be hacked or booby-trapped. The combat in Watch Dogs has a great balance of run-n-gun, sneaking, sabotage and preplanning. Hacking is a boat load of fun and actually makes trying to be stealthy worth it.
I had played the original driver some many years ago when that came out and I was really looking forward to driving around and the car chases in this game. I had played Grand Theft Auto and had gotten into a few car chases in that game. This... is nothing like that. The cops are smart and significantly more skilled at hunting you down than in any other game I've played recently. I found myself hacking signs on the side of the road so they come to a crash, changing red lights and even parking and hiding in my own car to get away.
What can you really hack? Pretty much everything. Someone walks by you? Feel free to access their bank account through their phone. See a car you want? Unlock it and its yours! While wandering around you will also be notified of citizens that are in need of assistance and its up to you if you want to help or simply let it happen.
Overall I would say that this is the best game out there for the ps4 right now."
3268,5,"As a longtime pokemon fan, this purchase was a no-brainer for me. For this installment I chose to not look at any spoilers of the game beforehand, so these are my thoughts while playing through:

New Pokemon:
Any game with new pokemon usually guarantees a thumbs up from me. I'm less of a fan of remakes because I played through the originals so many times as a kid. The new pokemon this time around were all really great and I felt like a kid again seeing them all for the first time. I also really liked the addition of alolan forms for some of the original 151 pokemon, but there were only ~15 of those total (including some evolutions), which was kind of disappointing. Another great thing is that there are plenty of new legendaries / special pokemon to catch, which I felt was lacking in X/Y.

Z Moves:
Instead of mega-evolution, this game introduces z-moves. They are essentially a once-per-battle super move that you can use by attaching an item to your pokemon. Honestly, I prefer mega evolutions. It breathed new life into some pokemon by changing abilities and appearance. Z-moves are kind of boring...

Trial battles instead of gyms:
""Trials"" replaced gyms in this installment. This was a super cool new addition in my opinion. A lot of people are unsure how they feel about the change, but I thought trials were great. They are very similar to gym battles in terms of progression through battles/ puzzles to be solved, but the advent of totem pokemon, enemies calling for help during battle, and increased stats made them more challenging and satisfying.

Extra features:
In terms of extra features, this game did a good job. Replacing hidden machines with pokemon riding was a great idea, it really makes you feel more involved and saves your teams' move slots. Pokemon refresh and poke-pelagio are also fun little mini games that offer benefits during the main game. Festival plaza is basically more cumbersome way to connect to the internet/ interact with others, but it adds minigames and shops that can be fun as well. Lastly, breeding for competitive play is easier and quicker than ever, which is always appreciated by those getting into online play for the first time.

Overall, I really enjoyed (and am still enjoying) the game! I would recommend it to any pokemon fan new or old, and even as an introduction to the series, as the game itself isn't too hard and there is a huge variety of pokemon to catch! The game has a few ways to increase or decrease difficulty, such as the exp share and constant stream of rare candies, which is great for easing new players in, or for veterans who want more of a challenge."
3269,5,One more closer to completing my collection.
3270,5,"This game is great its just like that online game by Nitto Inc
i think ppl should check into it. hours of game play"
3271,5,"This isn't really a game.  It's interactive TV, and it's fantastic! Great production values, and the Kinect integration works really well.  The Kinect part is reminiscent of Happy Action Theater - it just works, and it's easy enough for any little one to understand.  The simple gestures it asks the player/viewer to do are instantly recognized, and voice recognition works perfectly!  I think it's cool, but most importantly my 3 yr old absolutely loves it!  Some of the best money I've ever spent on a Kinect-related product."
3272,5,Perfect.
3273,5,"Fun for the kids and the kids at heart to play the disney infinity games.  But before you buy check and see, but I think disney is going to no longer do the infinity games."
3274,5,The music and track in this game really are challenging and skillful to learn which makes it all the better when you beat your friends
3275,5,"This game is so fun to play. Though some are complaining that it is short, you can play against people online and the computer over and over again. For me, it was totally worth the price. I love it! It's very entertaining."
3276,5,"This game is so creppy, and has an amazing and sad plot. The sadest thing about this game is what happends to Steve *SPOILERS* He dies :( I'm a Steve/Claire Fan, and so is my neice, and this is the part of the game I hate. Besides Steve's death however, This game is good, and very dark."
3277,5,"I like shooter games: Fallout, Call of duty, Rainbow series, Splinter Cell, Halo, Ex Deus  ETC. I always play at the highest play level. Other than ""lode runner"" type games I don't like arcade games.

But this one is NUTS. This is a real INTENSE high-energy first-person shooter. I played SAM in xbox and now 360. For each scene or scenario just fight to the next one. Collect health and armament, take a breath of relief and go on. .

Why do I like it? . Its got very good graphics, you can save when you want (need this), extremely challenging, fun and enjoyably offbeat. Its like eating pistachios - take one and then you want another.

Beware, I can't go on beyond the average play level. If I do, I'm done. If I don't its great. The moral is find you own play level and ENJOY.

GO Croteam.. .."
3278,5,"Its really great, you don't have to keep buying batteries for your Wii remotes.  It also doesn't take forever to charge!"
3279,5,Very happy.
3280,5,"I purchased this controller because I'm horrible at video games and enjoy smashing controllers and my my! This gray-blue Uncharted 4 themed controller is so beautiful. When I get get salty and almost throw it, I think twice!"
3281,5,Great cable. Thanks
3282,5,great
3283,5,Impaling enemies with rails and long pipes is awesome. The guns feel great.
3284,5,"I don't get all the negative reviews. i played the game to the end and loved it. Strait forward game play with some bugs here and their but nothing to bad. Much better then ""Wanted""."

I cannot even imagine it working any better than this.  It is stable as can be, more stable than my TV itself.  It is adjustable but holds firm to adjustments.  It uses no adhesives and will not mark up your TV with tape or residue.  It makes a very stable platform and the Kinect sensor very easily locks on firmly on and removes easily by holding two buttons.  I have used it on both my LG 52"" LCD TV and my Vizio 47"" LCD TV.  It is quite easy to move it and re-adjust it too.

It can expand the main assembly by double its default width by holding the back 2 buttons and it slides out further.  The whole back arm rotates down, but ratchets loudly and securely so that it will not release on its own.  The back arm has a wide rubber contact to add some grip.  The front is just a plastic edge with no adhesive or rubber so it only intends to hold onto the front but not mark up or leave residue on your TV frame.  The sensor easily fits and locks firmly by holding the two front buttons and slipping it on, or slipping it off and then releasing.

Before this, there was only that other TV mount with terrible reviews that had arms to reach down the back of your TV and reach mount points which fit few TV sets well if at all.  Or you needed a wall mount and anchors and wasn't suited for corner TVs.  Or you needed to stand the Kinect below or in front which limits your play space more.  Or what lots of people did was buy the Playstation Eye Camera TV clip, and use Velcro and adhesives to attach the Kinect sensor to it.  This is exactly what was missing for mounting your Kinect easily and securely."
3286,5,Gave as a gift he liked it
3287,5,"This was meant to be use on my PC so please factor that. In my view, I like the USB Sensor Bar better than the wireless sensor bar that uses battery for the PC.

3288,5,Good quality
3289,5,"Great product, my husband loves playing Titanfall.

Update: After 1 year 6 months of purchasing our console, we are still very happy with the purchase. This bundle is worth every penny. We use it all the time, for playing games, not only Titanfall, we also play Diablo ROS among others. We never had any issues with the system or the hardware. My favorite feature is the kinect, that makes everthing so simple with the voice commands, being able to record a portion of your game, make screenshots, turn on or off your console. Opening apps like Hulu and Netflix with voice commands as well, it is all just great. We highly recommend this bundle for people that are willing to invest in a high quality product with the best technology and highest versatility between being not only a console but also an entertainment center."

3292,5,"This is a fun game for the family to play, or to play alone. My son loves it and gets excited when I put it in the Wii to play. There is a great variety of different games to play so there is always something new to do."
3293,5,good product
3294,5,"I use this for my GPD Win 2. Fits like a glove. Spacious enough for my external ssd's, power source, and extra cables. Worth every cent."
3295,5,"This item arrived on time, great description, and works great! Very happy with purchase!"
3296,5,"If there is one word to describe this game, it is: HUGE! I mean there is so much to do in this game. I've played for about 4 hours and I have only completed 2% of the game-it is that big!

On this fictional country: ""Panau"", there are tons of hidden objects, easter eggs, vehicles, buildings to destroy, and side missions which some complain about being too repetitive. But I mean really, what sandbox game have you ever played in which the side missions were not too repetitive? You could probably find only a few if at best for most of them are highly repetitive! inFamous was probably the most repetitive game I've ever played and the graphics were not even that great! But tons of people love that game-I was so bored by it after 2 days! The variability in missions are fine in Just Cause 2 and there are a number of approaches you can take upon successfully beating them.

As for the the storyline and cutscenes, they remind me of the days of yore when you had those cheesy PSOne movies where the people look side to side when talking! But you know what, this was a perfect sacrifice. To make a world this big without any loading problems, glitches, or even screen tearing-you gotta cut production on those cutscenes-it only makes sense to do so. And besides, I have only been enthralled by only a few video game story lines and Uncharted 1 & 2 are two of those. So usually in my opinion, cut scenes or video game story lines are pointless. I'm all about do and less talk! The actual in-game graphics are outstanding. Trust me-do a sky dive from 20,000ft at sunrise in the game and you will be blown away! There are such rich and full detail-its ridiculous! I mean, on a clear day you can see clearly into the bottom of the ocean! Yes! You can see fish, coral, sand ripples, sea shells, even underwater currents that sweep sand along!

The best part of this game would definitely be your trusty grappling hook attachment! I just love this! For those that have played it, it's not like ""Batman: Vengence"" for PS2 where you only have predetermined grappling points which I thought was kind of lame considering you were BATMAN! Anything that is a solid, you can attach to! Even the bottom floor of a lake! Coupled with the disposable and infinite stunt parachutes makes these great character accessories. It's also always great when you can tether the grappling hook to a moving enemy jeep onto the road and see it flip over with all it's passengers! Nice!

Now some people complain about the in game controls for vehicles and such. I'm not so sure why this is. For me, the controls were very easy to get used to! The cool thing (which I wish most games gave you the option!) is that you can select your trigger (R1 or R2, L1 or L2) preferences for weapon shooting. I prefer the R1 and L1. I never liked using R2 and L2 for shooting and I have always hated that change once PS3 came around. But again that's just me.

Anyway, one last great thing about this game and I am pretty certain that this is a PS3 exclusive, is that you can capture videos directly from the game and either upload to youtube or save as a video file on your PS3 hard drive. This comes in handy when you would like to document some easter egg locations for your friends or compare stunt manuevers/mission approaches.

This game is terrific! This game is so big/intense that I traded in 4 other games that I got bored with just to commit my time to do this one!

GET IT! GET IT NOW! ARRRGGHHHH!"
3297,5,"Before I get into why I gave this game a 5 Star rating you should understand what this product is. It is not a video game, but rather an interactive movie. You make choices as you follow and affect how the story unfolds. There are (I believe and may be wrong) 28 different endings depending on your choices. If you like games that are choice based and not looking for a first person shooter or RPG, then this is your game.

The story and acting is great, the choices and diversity that is given to the player are numerous. You have replay-ability that will have you going back making different decisions just to see how characters and events change. It can be a bit creepy, but not nearly as bad as most thriller/horror games I've seen and played.

It is a great story that will change upon your decisions and for that alone made this game so much fun to play over and over. Just understand that there is very little in terms of playing an action based type game, but there are moments that the game incorporates aspects of a traditional FPS.

Have fun!"
3298,5,"There are many injustices in the world. Amongst gaming these offenses take on the form of games that go under-appreciated despite often being ""better"" than the hyped titles which overshadow them.

Back when I was an early 20 something my best friend was nice enough to share his pc with me and introduce me to Diablo. It was the first game of its' genre I played and I was immediately engrossed by it. Diablo wasn't a game of complexities. In it gamers filled the shoes of a lone adventurer tasked with helping a troubled town via clearing out a foreboding cave of its` demonic inhabitants. Along the way the unlikely hero chugged health and magic potions to survive. A beleaguered slayer of the damned could also buy or find ""better gear"" to prepare for the worst case scenario right before diving back into the bowels of hell. Every once in awhile the wary protagonist encountered a ""boss devil"" or ""boss undead"" which was 5 times more mammoth than anything else encountered before. The ridiculous scaling and size ratio of ""under lords"" when compared to their lesser minions instilled dread and tension in gamers everywhere.

A year or so later I got the Diablo 2 Battle Chest. It had more classes, a more in depth plot, and a bigger world and yet the magic was already wearing thin for me. Blizzard kept fooling around with things behind the scenes. Certain characters such as the paladin got ""nerfed"" while bosses and creatures were changed around to the point the strategy guide that came with the Battle Chest was no longer very helpful. To this day fan-boys still claim Diablo 2 is THE BEST of the pack. I cannot help but to think this vocal majority is too doped up on the opium of nostalgia to have an honest opinion.

Don't misunderstand me. I have endearing memories of Diablo 2 yet for some reason the first Diablo is my favorite between them. I'm probably in the minority so weigh that with a little discernment.

It's my personal viewpoint that Titan Quest Gold takes everything Diablo 2 did and does it better. Set in the world of ancient Greece it chronicles the story of ""The Titans"" emerging from the under world to wreak havoc upon the gods and their mortal followers.

The first thing to take in is the game is beautiful for an isometric dungeon hack. Tall grass sways when you run through it and despite the cornucopia of vibrant colors, detailed flora, impressive water effects, voiced dialogue, and  thick hordes of enemies the frame rate only stutters occasionally.

Classes are also much more varied. Though you start out on one path of mastery you'll eventually get to choose a secondary focus and these ""combinations"" add infinite possibilities. For example when I combined my hunter with a wanderer I got a ""Ranger"". This allowed me to quicken the rate of my healing items, summon a wolf, and gave me bonuses when fighting any opponent of a somewhat bestial nature. By contrast my friend who joined my campaign was an eclectic blend of a warrior and a necromancer. He could call upon a lich, buff his attack damage, and lay waste to just about anything that was unfortunate enough to enter his path! Our co-op lan party was a seamless experience. After partnering up we could do in game trading and share experience.

If you're afraid Greece is going to get tired to look after awhile, Iron-lore has you covered. You'll travel through Sparta, The Silk Road, The Mediterranean, Egypt, the pits of Hades, and along the creepy shores of  the river Styx to get to the bottom of all the unrest and upheaval.  Titan Quest has a robust bestiary of monsters to compliment the exotic locales. If you're the type who studies mythological creatures and ""ancient civilizations"" in general this game will be your chocolate covered cherry topped Sunday!

Accompanying the mass scale slaughtering are countless item drops. Not only can you collect hundreds of weapons, shields, rings, necklaces, and armor pieces but you can also further enhance them via an alchemy system.

Normally the sheer scope of Titan Quest's massive world would make it daunting to explore. Fortunately, a convenient artifact allows participants to instantly portal to any previously visited town whenever they wish.  This device is likewise a two-way dimensional gateway enabling players to return to their dungeon without any hiccups or hassles!

Assuming I had a few points to knit pick it would be the voice acting itself isn't the greatest, there are very few ways to customize your character's appearance beyond a gender choice, and the flow of the narrative never gives you a sense of personal investment or identity.  Aka the flaws that have been with this genre since its' inception are still lingering around like annoying pigeons on the lawn.

For you if

If you are still waiting for Diablo 3 to chug along you cannot ask for much better filler than Titan Quest. Along with the Sacred series it's a standard setter of the hack n slash rpg mold. With great co-op, beautiful visuals, and easy to understand game play TQ makes it easy for gamers to pick it up and play it without unsavory snags of frustration! TQ also is a love letter to ancient myths, legendary heroes, and old world civilizations.

Not for you if

Many players of rpgs eventually move onto more complex examples of the genre. Sometimes we like an rpg with multiple choices that plays out like a well written book. If you can level anything at TQ it is that its' world is bland save for its' combat. Npcs don't give you a choice of diverse actions to respond with and your hero is built solely for collecting loot and slaughtering  droves of baddies. There are gamers out there looking for the next Elder scrolls, the next Mass Effect, the next Witcher, and the next Deus Ex. For them TQ's old fashioned linear conventions could be more tedious than  fun.

How does it compare to the competition?

Sacred Gold and Sacred 2 have the inclusion of mounts whereas TQ is lacking.

However, TQ has a more diverse combination of skills and classes. What seems limited at first opens up later when you realize you can mix and match any two occupations to build a unique character.

Sacred 2 definitely seems much bigger when it comes to the sheer scale  of its' map. Not only that, but Sacred Gold & Sacred 2 are more of an open ended sandbox allowing you to do quests in any order whereas TQ plods you along in a rather linear direction despite a few branching side quests along the way.

For me co-op was more enjoyable in TQ than it was in Sacred 2 and Sacred Gold. Being able to trade gear with your buddy effortlessly and share gold are major pluses TQ does better than Sacred.

The missions seem more varied in the Sacred series but I personally found many of the escort missions to be nay impossible due to the stupid AI of my companions. By contrast TQ's objectives are less frustrating.

Both competitors break even. If you want mounts, a gigantic map, and the ability to do tasks in any order I'd suggest Sacred Gold or Sacred 2 but if you want a wider array of character builds, smoother co-op, and numerous skills TQ should be your main!

Final verdict

As a hack n slash treasure nabbing rpg TQ gets 5 out of 5 karate chops!

As a riveting epic with interesting characters, branching story paths, and unexpected plot twists it gets 1 disappointed sigh of sheer boredom!"

3309,5,Excellent game
3310,5,"******Even more recent Update/Edit******

After playing through an entire campaign, I can genuinely feel justified in giving the game five stars.  The replayability has some huge issues for me, since the amount of nations, large and small, in the game are tremendous, and yet you can only play as some 10 or so of them, not even with the rest as unlockables.

- I fully understand the golden arrows over cities, and this is immensely helpful in keeping track of buildings in the scattered towns, mines, workshops that are not labeled on the map

- Technology research is a vastly superior method of keeping certain technologies and eras on chronological track without requiring hundreds of ""Marian reform"" type scripted events like in Rome Total War or Medieval II Total War

- Gentlemen must go into universities to speed up technological research, or to kill enemy Gentlemen in duelling, in order to slow their research.

- The choppy map was resolved by getting a better video card for my computer.  But that still doesn't excuse its excessive memory/graphical requirements.

However, what is seriously worth mentioning is the AI.  Compared to RTW and M2TW, it's not a step down---it's a careen down the stairs.  I had to end my Ottoman campaign early because in the middle of Bosnia, a thousand miles from any British settlement, an entire British army appeared out of NOWHERE just 5-6 turns into the game and took my settlement.  I had no army anywhere close to this region, and nowhere near enough money to so much as stack up my cities with militia.

So I started easy with Britain.  The experience can be summarized as this: Everyone wants to kill you, and will look only for the most menial and trivial of excuses to do so.  This is not so much an exercise in Imperialism as it is in Accidental Imperialism or Protective Expansion.

Example: France is a major power, so I want their land.  I take it, and hunt France down and kill them all.  Spain, my long-time ally, decides to declare war on me for absolutely no reason, though perhaps simply because I border them.  So I conquer them with some difficulty, and take their last city in Northern Italy.  Then, because I border the Italian states, Genoa declares war on me.  So I destroy Genoa, and then Venice declares war on me.  So I destroy Venice, and Westphalia declares war on me.  So I destroy Westphalia, and all is temporarily well.

Out of nowhere, Sweden, a nation I'm not even able to see on the map beyond fog of war, declares war on me.  It's war actions for the next 10 in-game years is to blockade my major ports in Britain... with light galleys, the naval equivalent of a soldier on a bicycle with a slingshot.

So to stop this BS, I take the war to Sweden directly, conquering all of Finland and Norway, and pushing them out of Sweden... when out of nowhere, they send a HUGE army to Britain, and take London INSTANTLY (because there's no such thing as sieging in this game's AI---you don't have to build siege equipment, you can just instantly attack any city).  Eventually I took London back, since England is where my best troops can be built.

After taking Sweden, I notice I'm now bordering Russia.  Since I'm not stupid, I start building expedition armies in England to prepare, and then Russia declares war on me.  So I break Russia badly, taking Moscow, St Petersburg, Arkhansgelsk, etcetera, and forcing a peace with them.

Meanwhile in the Americas, I was trying for some 50 years (half the game) to conquer the Iroquois Confederacy, since this would allow me to gain the 13 Colonies back to my Empire, but every time I got enough forces, some other BS would draw them away.  Finally when I got a big enough army, the Iroquois used a strategy called ""We're stupid"" in which they send one general with a tiny little force of some cavalry and peasants to pillage my lands, unimpeded for several turns since my forces literally have to CHASE them around the map.

Then out of NOWHERE, the Maratha Confederacy, from all the way in Southern India, lands a HUGE force in SPAIN and takes my city there.  Years later, they take one of my islands in the Carribean.  AN INDIAN ARMY TAKES A BRITISH COLONY IN THE CARRIBEAN.

But despite that, the Maratha Confederacy was the absolute best in-game opponent I've ever had in this game.  Their AI was cunning and tactful, And when I landed an expedition force in India, they bribed a tiny Indian kingdom to attack me, bleeding both myself and them, then they came down to crush me, sending the expedition home with only 400 of the original 6,000 men.

I sent a second expedition, which successfully gained a foothold in one city, and spent years with Marathans just watching, and marching all around it, with occasional skirmishes to stop them from pillaging towns and workshops.  Eventually, they forced me to divide my force, and then they took my city while most of my army was killing one of theirs.  I had to evacuate this army out of India entirely, and never returned.

I only wish there were more AI instances in that campaign like the one of the Marathan Confederacy.  It gave me the best and most intense view of Imperialism, guerrilla warfare, and nasty politics that I never got dealing with the rest of the campaign's AI, which ranged from ""Retardation"" to ""Crippling paranoia""

*****Most recent Update/Edit******

Due to prolonged experience with the game, I'm taking serious consideration into reducing the amount of stars I've given it.  That would force me to delete the review in order to re-submit it again.  Leave comments if you care enough about me (Awww) to have an opinion.

*********See reasoning for this at bottom of review.**********

Well, not aside.  I want to address this first.

If it weren't for Steam, I would have pre-ordered Empire Total War, and have had it brand new and shiny in my hands and on my computer the day it came out.

Instead I didn't.  Instead I didn't buy it and played it on another computer.

Because ""Steam"" is REQUIRED to play this game.  Because in order to play this game, you must go through what some Amazon-er in the discussion threads called ""SecuSteam"", which is kind of stupid, but it iterates the fact that Empire Total War is using a DRM reminiscent of EA's debacle with Spore and every other game they've released since mid-late 2008.  And because ""Steam"" received an ""F"" rating from the Better Business Bureau.

As such, I do not trust it.  I will never buy a game that has installation limits, activation requirements, no re-sale ability, and the potential for shady malware infection as SecuROM did with EA's games.  I said it so before, if the video game companies want to treat me like a pirate, I'd be better off becoming a pirate instead.  These kinds of DRM only encourage normally loyal consumers to instead opt for the pirated copies, which they can play without restrictions designed to thwart it.  It's what people who use metaphors call a ""catch-22"".

To the game...

I overestimated this game, I think; I'm someone who owns (and PURCHASED) Medieval II Total War, upped the graphics to their highest settings, and unit scale to Huge, and ended up with choppy action moving in ""screenshot mode"" with severely low framerate.  I struck a neat balance between graphics and speed by removing all Anti-Aliasing and shadows.

I was shocked, surprised, and shocked that Empire Total War actually ran BETTER than Medieval II Total War, with Anti-Aliasing x2 enabled.  There's still minor graphical issues, but not enough to detract from gameplay.

The game engine is a major leap from RTW and M2TW, but not in the sort of massive way that was Shogun/Medieval Total War to Rome Total War.  The campaign map is actually smaller, though there is far more information in your settlements and armies to take in, and it hurts slightly that the text on a 1024x768 window (in windowed mode) is very small and difficult to read.  There is text almost everywhere, and opening up settlement info is no longer like in RTW/M2TW where you have a list to select buildings to build, tax rates, recruitment, etcetera.

Instead, opening a settlement's information is more like opening the ""Settlement Details"" scroll in M2TW/RTW, which shows you things like religion, and the specific aspects causing unhappiness and population growth.  Taxation has its own separate scroll to open, by which you can adjust the tax levels for the Upper Classes separately from the Middle/Lower Classes.

Despite the significantly longer loading times compared to M2TW, the game's campaign map is fluid, if a bit choppy, and there is no additional loading required to shift ""theaters"" from Europe to America to India to the East Indies, etcetera.  It becomes a little tough, however, to keep track of the Americas when they're basically on what amounts to an entirely different map, and you can't just scroll there like you could in M2TW.

Turns are back to RTW basics, with two turns per year, each turn either Summer or Winter, and movement points are far larger to reflect an easier time in moving things around.  Though still it's slightly inaccurate in being far too much time to move things around.

The campaign aspect of the game is indeed a whole 'nother being for the Total War player like me---unlike RTW to M2TW, you won't be able to hop in and master it all within one gaming session of an hour or so.  There's far too much to take in all at once, and the camera controls are different (in that the Right click button no longer scrolls when you hold it down) and cannot be modified.

Battles:

The sea battles are exactly as I pictured they would be in fantasizing about naval battle in Rome Total War.  You have the same deployment-grid layout as with ground battles, to arrange your ships as you want.

Naval combat is rather like that in ""Sid Meier's Pirates!"", only you must micro-manage ALL your ships at once, which is what causes problems for so many as I've read in forums already.

The sea battles are fun, even if they're still rather ""Beta Stage""-ish.  There is no clipping with the ships, so you can gape in horror as one of your surrendered ships suddenly gets jerked back by the wind, and rams right into the side of your flagship, bringing both ships to a total stop and letting the enemy bash you to death.

You have no control over the melee combat in boarding ships, but you have total control over broadsiding, as you can pick round shot, chain shot, or cannon shot, manually rotate your ship into position, load up the cannons and wait for them all to be ready, and then fire once an enemy ship comes into your target radius.

Land battles are essentially unchanged from the Total War standard, which is great.

My experience with the Rome Total War mod ""Napoleonic Total War II"" and with the gunpowder units in Medieval II Total War left me a bit disillusioned in thinking the AI would have severe problems in infantry firing, as if one rifleman gets out of line, they all stop and wait for him to fall back in place before even reloading.

This is all fixed, as gunpowder infantry fire at a steady pace, uninterrupted by stupidities in pathfinding or AI.  And they no longer freak out and stop firing if their line is bent in any way; I've seen riflemen continuing to fire even after a stupid move by my part has their line bending like an arc.

Artillery in particular are incredibly impressive, and made even more so by the fact that they are LOUD AS HELL!  I zoomed in to a group of my cannons on the field, and jumped in my seat as they fired, with a sound like someone firing a gun near my face.

Unlike Medieval II Total War with Rome Total War, this is not a game that could replace its predecessor, due to its extreme changes in the game engine, as well as the completely changed battlefield mechanics due to the fundamental shift in warfare from melee to gunpowder.

My only major complaint on the game itself is that all the game files are in separate "".pack"" files, and as such cannot be modified directly as Rome Total War or Medieval II post-unpacking could be.  Unless they release an unpacking tool at some point, I don't see how this game will be open to modification.

*******EDIT*********
And my new major complaint: I am a Total War player since 2004, though I am limited to the engine used by Rome Total War and Medieval II Total War.  From that perspective, this game is almost unplayable for me.

Even approaching it as a completely new gamer to the experience, I found it so immensely and insanely complex and off-putting by its hellish amount of details and multi-tasking, that I cannot get past a few turns in the main campaign.

The new campaign map is far more animated than its predecessors.  As such, it is choppy for me when trying to scroll.  There is so much information to take in, as not only do you have cities in regions to handle, but every region has one city, and several satellite towns and farms and ports that you must INDIVIDUALLY handle or else have your region fall behind in economy and production.

The fog of war does not hide unknown settlements, and so there will be city labels all over the map, further adding to the confusion in determining where everything is, especially when these satellite towns mentioned don't even have labels, so I found myself clicking on enemy towns for several seconds to build better farms, unaware that it wasn't even in my territory.

Rather than the placid colors and shapes and small vegetation from the previous games' maps, this one has everything in stark bold colors, with huge trees littering many areas, green grass like Eden in twilight, that it's a merciless assault on the eyes when you have to keep track of so many things on this landscape all at once, or else risk having enemy armies ransack all your towns and farms without you even realizing it until two turns later.

This micro-managing of farms and the like also causes problems with costs.  It means you have to spend 2000 money on each individual farm in each individual estate in a single region, adding up to around 10,000 for farms within a three or four region nation.  This is simply BAD ECONOMY for a WAR game.  When you're spending enough money for half an army just on farms, whereas in previous games you'd spend less than half that for the same amount, you start to hemhorrage money and start getting enemies raiding your territory because you can't afford a standing army to stand in EVERY SINGLE MINI TOWN and port and farm.

Then the information.  There is tons of it, and I haven't even figured out what most of it means.

-I don't understand why the tax rate is uniform for your entire nation rather than differentiated between cities.

-I don't understand what the golden arrows floating above cities means.

-I don't understand why I'm supposed to care what sort of crop is being traded where.

-I don't understand why I should be forced to research technologies and the like, Civilization style, taking two years and 3000 money just to be able to build fences around my farms.

-I don't understand why I can't hire mercenaries, and yet I can train soldiers from a general when out of a city, and yet those trained soldiers end up spawning at my capital.

-I don't understand how upgrading governmental buildings, improving bureaucracy, and the like, somehow causes UNHAPPINESS due to ""repression"", which seems to occur no matter if your government is a humble republic or a tyrannical empire.

-I don't understand what purpose the ""gentleman"" agent serves, as he can't do anything.  Nor can I even train agents, as they spawn randomly wherever the hell they feel like spawning. (NOTE: I know what Gentlemen do now)

So it appears that my opinion on Empire: Total War has changed very drastically.  I still haven't given up on the game, but I'm not liking how my review stands at five stars as of late."
3311,5,"The combat in this game is great for an MMO. Rather than button mashing, GW 2 requires more player input. One button makes you dodge, while skills are tied to specific weapon types, so swapping out creates on the fly battle strategies between close and long range encounters.

The standard class structure of other MMO's is more flexible here, for instance every class can heal.  You can build and play a character that appeals to your play style. You have more choice where to play in the world, and how to play. It feels more like a living, breathing world, combining scripted stories and dynamic events. It is easy to get lost here for a long time . . .

Guild Wars 2 graphics are something to gush over, as the game looks absolutely stunning.  (but be sure to check the recommended specs against your own rig.)  This game is very critically acclaimed and with good reason. This is top-shelf MMO game play at a bargain bin price when you consider the massive content that you get with - wait for it - no monthly fee. Unlike subscription MMO's, GW 2 costs only the initial purchase price.

MMO's are one of the most popular types of games for the PC. If you like MMO's, or have long been curious but shy about committing to the initial purchase price plus a monthly fee, GW2 deserves a look."
3312,5,"Still haven't finished the game (didnt have time) but its a great game, worth trying."
3313,5,"I also own the G700 and the G700s and I like this one better than both of them. Somehow, the range is better; but the styling also looks way cooler. Batteries last FOREVER. Grab yourself this and four Eneloop AA batteries with a charger and you're set for life."
3314,5,great
3315,5,This is a fantastic deal for this amount of money giving you awesome statues and a very good guide with posters and even an artbook :)
3316,5,Product was in great condition upon arrival. Minimal wear but no technical issues whatsoever
3317,5,Awesome game!!!
3318,5,"Very great game console, 100% satisfied. I'm lucky buying this system and then applying for the 20 GB Hard Drive upgrade Microsoft program with 3 months of Xbox Live for an additional 30 dollars. If you pretend to download content from Xbox or want to upgrade your console to the New Xbox Experience a hard drive is a must have, the memory included isn't enough because the NXE upgrade takes half of the 256 MB. Excellent graphics using it with the not included HDMI cable, a new cable I bought from here for less than 2 dollars."
3319,5,"Collection complete, fun game"
3320,5,"I bought Demon's Souls when it first came out.  I did not expect much but was i in for the ride of my life.  The story, forget it.

The Bosses, the enemies, the suspense, the characters, the environments, the leveling system; all combine to make this the EQUALIZER to the gaming industry.

I retired my copy and have it sitting NICELY on my mantle above my fireplace!!!!"
3321,5,Wicked awesome!
3322,5,Always
3323,5,"Killing zombies, how can you go wrong!"
3324,5,The game sucks the fire power is far too sad it takes a full clip of head shots for a kill However its worth it just for the watch which is far too nice to wear every day but a bitchin dress watch
3325,5,"Amazing game. I've owned NFS Hot Pursuit 2 and compared to that game, This is on a whole new level. My computer managed to max out all the settings at stock clock speeds. Here are the specs: AMD A-10 7850K, Gigabyte GA-F2A88XN- Wifi Motherboard, Corsair Vengeance Blue 8gb 2133 ram, WD blue 500Gb Hdd drive and, Windows 7 professional 64 bit."
3326,5,I am so tired changing batteries for this item so I purchase this so I don't need to go thru batteries  all the time.
3327,5,"the best gameplay ever!
highly Recommended

If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them."
3328,5,"These controllers are great, especially for the price. Fit and finish I would say is on par with a standard SNES/SFC controller. I've been using these for weeks and they've been holding up very well. If you were really inclined, you could easily swap out the PCB on this controller with one in a SNES controller and have an actual USB SNES controller with very little work. So far so good with two of these though. They're great for a Retro Pi implementation!"
3329,5,"Have no problems with this controller. It works just like the original, looks and feels good. Synced with the system quickly and worked smooth for and hour straight of super Mario Wii u. Just ordered another one. These will be put under stress for smash Bros and Mario cart 8 over the next two weeks. If they hold up, then I would recommend this Controller over the original, expensive choice any day."
3330,5,"The graphics looks very sharp, perfect colors too! Ever since I bought this item to my son he will never take the game down! I played it with the family, and the game is goofy, creative, and fun! I invited my sons friends to play with him rayman origins and they keept playing for hours! This game must be one of my favorite games! I will certinly recomend this game to anybody that is going to buy this game."
3331,5,"I ordered these to play Sing Star on my PS3, and these work great.  Setup was a breeze, and other than not being wireless, these are perfect.  The quality exceeds our singing voices, and the cords do breakaway should anything bad happen."
3332,5,excelente
3333,5,I wanted a brand new DS Lite and this was exactly that. Little more than I wanted to pay but its been worth it.
3334,5,"This is by far one of my favorite games. The graphics are outstanding and the game play is thought provoking. The environment allows a player to use objects creatively to eliminate threats. The plasmids are very fun to use and provides hours of laughter. Having recently rebuilt my computer, I have found that a 2gig, 1.86 Intel Duo, NVIDIA 7600gt, allows for full settings at a decent screen size. I have had no issues with frame freezes or experienced lags in frame rate.

The AI is pretty good and provides more of an overall challenge. The characters seem to be part of the world and do not simple appear from no where like other games. (Doom) The game does not feel forced as far as open ended vs. linear. There are plenty of areas to explorer that are not necessarily required to complete the game.

I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. (Mature audiences)"
3335,5,"My previous game pad was clunky and unresponsive. I'd play a game that I would normally do well in with no problem using a console controller, and get stomped because the pad was so bad. So I went online, and looked at other options for game pads and came across the Logitech Precision game pad. I read the reviews, and everyone said it was great. And at the low price of ten bucks, I decided to try it out. Let me tell you, this pad is a great way to spend ten bucks if you play games on your computer. The buttons are extremely responsive. In a section of a game I died at least 20 times in before giving up on with my old game pad, I completed it without dying once using the Logitech Precision.

In conclusion, this game pad is definitely worth every penny."
3336,5,"Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed takes another new spin on the series. The battles are real-time and not turn based like all the other games. I won't go too much into details as a great review has already been posted by someone else so I'll mainly stick to details on why I like the game. I really enjoy the music and if you are a fan of the series and have played the other games you will definitely recognize some of the tracks or if you just jumped into being a fan recently and played games like Hyperdevotion Noire or Producing Perfection you will hear familiar tunes. The game still has quests that you partake in some with certain rules that only allow you to use certain characters (so you will have to make sure you level everyone up accordingly) and other quests that do not give you a victory condition so you have to fight (or do something else) to actually clear the quest which I think is one of the best new features of the game as you actually have to think and experiment to clear these quests although usually if you read the explanation of the quest very carefully you can figure out what you need to do. The medal system replaces the need for currency in the game as you earn new weapons by collecting medals you get from defeated enemies so the game definitely has a lot of replay value if you want to get everything as you will find yourself playing quests over and over to get enough medals to unlock everything. The story still has the same funny, witty responses us fans of the series have grown to love especially Neptune she's the same as ever and I wouldn't have her any other way. :-) I think this is a great addition to the series and I suggest if you are a fan to the series to definitely pick up a copy."
3337,5,It's the only game I'm playing now
3338,5,This is a classic game and plays a lot like it's NES daddy just updated for the Wii. Don't hesitate to buy this game you won't regret it. It's a lot of fun to try and get all the gears in each level. I found this game more fun than New Super Mario Bros for the Wii and I loved that gave too.
3339,5,Fun game! But it's not nearly as scary as they make it out to be.....and it really is about split decisions.
3340,5,I enjoyed it.
3341,5,Kids use
3342,5,"My kids love this game- it's apparently pretty challenging. They often spend their mornings before school, discussing what needs to happen to open the next clue, or trying to figure out what a particular hint means, so it must be pretty engrossing. (I don't personally play it.) So, from a mom-perspective, I'm pretty happy with it- it's making them think, and the fight scenes aren't as loud or icky as some. Resident Evil is a fairly large franchise, and I'm pretty sure this won't be the last of 'em that we get. :)"
3343,5,My 11-year-old Son loves it!
3344,5,Works the way it's supposed to! Not sure why other people have had issues but mine works great!
3345,5,"This was always a good way to kill time when hanging out at the local watering hole.  When you run out of stuff to talk about with your buddies, each person pitches in a buck or two and then go to town on Touchmaster.  Now I can play for free.  Free is very good.  These are all pretty addictive games that you can play for hours, and I know I have since I bought the game.
As far as the Trivia game acting up as some of the others have stated, I don't know.  I haven't played it a bunch of times yet.  I've always been more of a Mahki fan.  However, if it does act up for me I will put an update on here to let people know it's still happening.
All in all, if you enjoyed this game in your local establishment of choice, you'll need to pick this up.

***UPDATE*** As of 2/15/08, the Trivia game has locked up on me all of 1 time.  Not sure if it has anything to do with it, but it was a 26,000 point question.  So far though, it was the only time it locked up."
3346,5,"I absolutely love this game to the point where I actually purchased it on the PS3 and PS4 again, also I purchased the PS4 version for my lady; recommended first-person stealth assassin game."
3347,5,"I LOVE this game. But i never did play 1 or 2 before so i didn't have anything to be disappointed by.

The graphics are gorgeous and the story is pretty cool, the combat is a lot of fun. The controls are definitely a little wonky to start out but once you get used to it they really aren't bad at all.

If you enjoy games like Diablo don't pass this up for $5."
3348,5,Works perfectly! Especially love the pink color.
3349,5,Nice Game
3350,5,who doesnt love tetris
3351,5,"Summary: this is a decision based game, so it's mostly an interactive ""movie"" with the occasional ""choose what to do or say"" gameplay. Lots of exploration and conversations, some mystery solving, the occasional puzzle.

Pros:

Great story! It's weird, fun, different...you really get into it.

Amazing, deep characters. You see some really great character arcs, and you can actually care about them. People you dislike at first may turn out to be awesome...if you make the right decisions, that is.

Fantastic dialogue. It feels real, not the embarrassing, phony, trying too hard to be hip teen drivel like you would expect. It's off the hook, yo! /s

Artwork is top notch, hand painted assets look unique and set this game apart.

Cons:

Maybe could have had more puzzles, although I understand that wasn't the focus of this game.

If I have to listen to Mr. Jefferson's lecture one more time... 

I highly recommend this if you are looking for a good story, and maybe even to learn a little about yourself."
3352,5,Really like this game and am glad that I purchased. I love it and my grand children enjoy it as well.
3353,5,GREAT
3354,5,thank you
3355,5,Fun stuff I would recommend this friends and family League Of Legends is a fun game
3356,5,Master Chief! The game was fun and helped me relive my younger days in gaming! P.S. this takes FOR-EV-ER to download! (Said in Squints voice from The Sandlot)
3357,5,"Republic Commando is a surprisingly challenging, and exciting game!  Commando gives the player control of not only his own avatar, but limited control over the other three members of his squad.  You as number 38 are the leader of an squad of the Republics elite Clone troopers as they battle their way across numerous theaters fighting separatists and assisting allies like the Wookies on Kasshyk.

During game play, you have access to numerous weapons from the hard ammo firing blaster pistol to the clone sniper rifle to many other weapons that you acquire from fallen enemies along the way.

Unlike battlefront, Commando limits your experience to one role, however it puts all game progress right into your hands.  You can store your game as you go so as to pick up where you left off in the fight or re-start the level if you choose.

Along the way you'll be assisted by allies, including Clone regulars and Wookies, and you'll get to explore new worlds, meet interesting droids and aliens and kill them.

Another great feature of the game is that each squad member has his own personality.  The born killer, the sarcastic joker, the all business soldier. They complain like grunts, joke like grunts, and sound and act like autonomous troops, albeit with adherence to the chain of command.

This game is challenging in that the droids and Geonoshians are incredibly formidable opponents!  But the access to weapons and demolitions make the game continuously entertaining.

I can't praise this game highly enough!  The price absolutely cannot be beat!  If you're looking for a first person shooter, this is the game for you!

Five stars!"
3358,5,"If you thought Mario Kart 8 was already one of the best games in the series and a top-tier title for the Nintendo Wii U, just wait til you see that there's yet another positive to be known about the title: For the first time ever in gaming history, there's a video game that has reasonably priced DLC! This is actually a bundle of two DLC packs for the game, but it's a lot easier to judge it as one.

Not only do you get to have new characters come to the Mario universe to kart around such as Link from the Zelda series and Villager and Isabelle from Animal Crossing, but there are also four brand-new cups featuring half-and-half of shiny new original tracks and shiny new renditions of classic courses from Mario Karts gone by! Certain tracks include locations from the aforementioned series our new drivers are from, AND F-Zero and Excitebike; it's like this game is turning into Nintendo Kart (Although there are still a good dose of Mario-related tracks)! And I dunno if Nintendo implanted some sort of mind-reading device on me, but somehow they knew I wanted Ribbon Road and Cheese Land to return from Mario Kart Super Circuit! They're here, and oh my god they're simply BEAUTIFUL along with the rest of the DLC and game!!!

If the concept of a handful of characters and four cups to choose from sounds familiar to any of you out there, that's because that's the same kind of structure the Mario Kart series used to follow until Mario Kart DS (where courses from older games were brought back and first put into a retro category). Considering that Mario Kart 64's digital price isn't too far from this DLC's cost, I'd say it's just like buying an oldschool Mario Kart! After all, it certainly is as much fun as such (though some of you may actually find it all even better)!"
3359,5,"I Like The Departed, And More on Blu-ray Disc"
3360,5,I now know why this game is considered the last most awesome castlevania game since castlevania 4.. I am obsessed with part 4 and always wondered why they didn't continue with games like it and I don't know how or why I never bothered to give this game a try.. this is the perfect game to get into the Halloween spirit and well its a castlevania freaks dream come true.. the game is perfect and I consider it the best game I have ever played.. words cant even explain how highly I think of this game.. buy it and give it a try you won't regret it . I just wish they made games like this now a days.. I hate all these new weird games that are coming out .. I am amazed at how much this game has to offer .. never endless enemys of all types and the game just never ends..its very very long and challenging in a good way which I love.. no wonder this game is considered to be a gem ..
3361,5,I supposed to take the new one XBOX 360 SLIM But i got the XBOX 360 E SLIM That is better than the other new slim so im happy with this!! very good product nice value!
3362,5,"Very glad that they released the original version of this to the West. Haven't played it yet, but looking forward to it."
3363,5,"I play this on my windows 98 gateway computer. This pc game has two disc. Both with a story line. It even has one character name William Wallice the same character in the movie ""BraveHeart"". This game is very educational taking you back in the roman age. I love it cause it's adventures I wish it had animated blood shown when a person gets killed. I love building the wonders and the castle that shots arrows and monks that can convert the enemies and heal your allies."
3364,5,Great item would recommend to anyone and so far it's great no issues and its a go in my book!
3365,5,"Wow this is a great game and a great value, my advice is buy this game like i did cause d price is right and the game is great, a wonderful addition to your kinect games."
3366,5,"I first played this about 9 years ago (2007) on the snes (super nintendo) and i absolutely loved it.

It's an RPG. Instead of swords and magic spells you use yo-yo's and psychic powers.

The gameplay is nothing new.

Music is memorable/awesome.

writing is the best part. its sometimes sarcastic, dry, funny most of the time and it really pulls you into the story

overall this game is in my top 3 games ever! i highly recommend you play it, either buy it, or find it online, do whatever it takes. PLAY THIS GAME

total time to play is about 20-25 hours kinda short, but this is snes rmemeber"
3367,5,"Great game to enjoy while deployed, made time go buy quick!"
3368,5,works really good what eles can you really say the HDE battery pack and charger  cable for xbox 360 wireless controller works good
3369,5,Well I bought this for my best cousin and I have ever regretted buying this.. He plays constantly..AM glad that he love his gift and everything but gosh its an everyday thing with this game..He loves it. I cant really say how good it is as I am not a big fan of video games but I watch him and his friends play it all the time and they love it.
3370,5,"In short, this is a fantastic game and I would recommend this to any gamer, FPS fan or not. The campaign is epic, multiplayer is just darn addicting, and the other modes are simply the icing on the cake.

CAMPAIGN: (no spoilers)

Halo Reach's campaign takes place just before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved. You are put into the shoes of Noble 6, a member of a Spartan squad called Noble Team. During the campaign, you help out Noble Team in their defense of Reach against the Covenant, a courageous effort against impossible odds. The campaign is reasonably long, logging in at about 7-10 hours on your first playthrough, increasing or decreasing with difficulty or skulls activated. The campaign is very epic and entertaining, featuring a wide array of enemies, vehicles, and locations to discover. The graphics are excellent, though not ground-breaking. And on top of all that, the masterful music of Marty O'Donnell is put in, adding even more emotion to the story. Though the overall campaign is not as good as some of the past titles, it is still excellent and is highly recommended.

MULTIPLAYER:

In a nutshell, the multiplayer of Halo Reach is awesome, providing many new changes (i.e. armor abilities, new gametypes, maps), but still being the tried-and-true Halo multiplayer that we've grown accustomed to over the years. Some new weapons and vehicles have been added in, which are all very cool. Finding and joining a match is easy as pie, and you will find hosting a game with many friends has been made a lot easier. There is some occasional host migration, but not enough to detract from the overall experience. A cool new feature of this game is the sheer level of customization that you can put on your character, like armor pieces, helmets, coloring schemes, emblems, clan tags that you can use. You get most of these by earning credits from playing campaign, multiplayer, and firefight, but some are unlocked by default. These changed apply to multiplayer, firefight, and even campaign, appearing in the cutscenes as well. Offering new game modes like Invasion and returning classic old ones like Infection, Slayer, Big Team Battle, Grifball, and Assault, the multiplayer of Halo Reach is grand.

FIREFIGHT:

Returning from Halo 3: ODST, Firefight is Halo's version of Horde or Survival mode from many other games, adding in many new and interesting features. You can go it alone, invite some friends, or find a match (finally) with up to 4 people. You can adjust so many aspects of Firefight, including ammo, player traits like shielding and movement speed, enemy type, how many spawn, difficulty level, etc., and this makes an already great experience even greater.

FORGE:

Forge has returned from Halo 3, and is Halo's level editor. While you cannot change the level design itself, you can put in and delete weapons, structures, scenery, vehicles, and much, much more while in Monitor mode, easily switched to and from with the D-Pad. And the best part is that this is all done in real time, meaning that you and a bunch of friends can both work on the map or just fool around, as you can switch to a normal player easily. This makes for some hilarious mayhem and awesome finished products, so it is top-notch.

THEATER:

Theater from Halo 3 and Halo 3: ODST has returned, which is pretty self-explanatory-a place where you can record, rewatch, and edit your recent game sessions. While I have not used the feature much, it is very cool when I want to record some gameplay where I did really well, highlight the best parts, and put it in my file share so that my friends and the world can see.

CUSTOM GAMES:

In custom games, you can create your own game modes and game types that can be played with your friends. There's lots of room for creativity here, whether you want Superman-like, fast-moving, high-jumping Spartans facing off against each other, or slow, lumbering soldiers struggling to race to the other side of the map. It is a very fun mode to use, and what you do with it is completely up to your imagination.

OVERVIEW:

Overall, this is a fantastic game and sets a new standard for what modern FPS games should be. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck, and time spent playing this game is certainly time well spent. And for you parents out there considering getting this for your kid(s), I would only recommend it for youngsters 11 or older. There's a surprisingly low level of violence, blood, and profanity in this game, a level of which I consider a ""T"" rating. It's at your discretion which ages you let play this, but again, it's not that violent compared to most other games. So if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and buy this game now. It's a steal for $25 (writing this in October 2012), and it's even more fun if you have lots of friends to game with. I hope this review helped, and Remember Reach!"
3371,5,"Not much of a shooter, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. If you're looking for an immersive first person sci-fi/horror adventure, I think you'll probably love this."
3372,5,"This was one of the games that was recommended to get by a friend when I mentioned that I was getting a Wii and I wasn't disappointed with following her advice.  Shipping was done almost immediately, infact I received the wii fit long before I actually received my wii.
I had a little difficulty getting the foot thingies (that you have to use if placing the board on a carpet) to stay on but other than that...
The 'game' itself is fun and motivational which is great for someone like me who needs 'inspiration' to keep with the exercises.  You have Yoga poses, strength training as well as fun mini games such as hula hoops and snowboarding which helps with your centre of gravity (posture) - I swear I burned more calories laughing at my efforts with the exercises and games than what they actually calculated - but hey thats a good thing - right?
Its a pity that only one board can be used with this as it is definately one that I'll be packing in my luggage when I go home on leave to play with my mom and cousins.

Quick update - unless you have been working out on a regular basis and for a long time - check out the 'Wii fit for dummies' (book by Christina and Bill Loguidice) its a great support for the wii fit (as well as EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, and Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010).  It explains things from setting up the wii fit, to keeping safe whilst doing the exercises as well as getting the most out of the exercises and much more."
3373,5,I think this is a very good product it makes you controller rumble i like using it with my roller coaster game if you have a dream cast THIS IS A MUsT HAVE!!! enjoy :)
3374,5,Wireless is great. Works good.
3375,5,"hello, my friend! the product is of excellent quality and complies with all the features exposed by you. I have no complaints whatsoever! Thank you very much and happy day!"
3376,5,"Great Product, can't exactly confirm that improved my aiming, but it feels great on my thumbs and it does feels a little more sensitive the time to aim, definitely recommended for those seeking a quick way to improve your gaming experience"
3377,5,"Not sure why this gets a bad rep. It's a soft case, but not as soft as one of those silicone cases. It'll protect it from any nicks and scratches from normal use, and doesn't alter the feel in my hands. I'm sure better cases will come out over time, but for what's available now, and for what i paid ($9.99), it protects my $200 item pretty well."
3378,5,Grunt
3379,5,The game was okay
3380,5,My 6 year old son was thrilled!!
3381,5,A nice alternative to over priced Wii Remotes!
3382,5,great!
3383,5,"It becomes clear that a system, a habit or a routine is in place when critiques of the perennial Chessmaster always begin with a few diatribes. How do we justify the purchase of a fully priced Chessmaster this year compared to the previous edition? Then the reviewers turn towards the product feature sheet. What's added? Is the artificial intelligence improved? Is it noticeable? I think the artificial intelligence has progressed so much that a good majority of Chessmaster players can't tell the difference. The final question always boils down to: Whether it warrants purchasing. I don't think any other game has caused critics to ask this question so much that game reviewers themselves are turning into cynical Wall Street analysts. Where are the profits? What's your guidance? Do you have positive cash flow? How can you justify your share value?

Humor aside, Chessmaster has actually gotten friendlier with the years to come. Nowadays, you can find a simple game of chess, even multiplayer chess on casual gaming sites. Yahoo and MSN, for example, feature parlor activities for new players. I know at least a few non-gaming peers who take part in these and think it's a way to cool off from a day's work. So why in the world would these people buy Chessmaster? So they can be beaten in a few more million ways? Yes, but Chessmaster 9000 also features a bundle of high points to turn any casual player of chess into a pro.

Still, it can be intimidating. Chessmaster has a refined kids-look now to cater to the young ones. You get to play with players of your own age (if you were 8 or 10 years old) and the layout becomes a lot simpler. For example, you won't be bogged down with the A3 to A2 type of speak. There are also tutorials and quizzes to guide you through the game. These are lengthy in nature. I believe one of the tutorials to explain and test you on forming forks and defenses ran at least 170 dialogue pages (not actual pages but still) which are fully narrated. The tutorials usually explain what the objective of the particular lesson is and then follows it up by guiding you through a few set matches. After that, they'll give you traps and puzzles from which you are to make the correct move. It's good for a refresher but most tutorials, even for simple things like capturing pawns en passant, run at least twenty dialogue pages. So if you are prepared to go by the book, you're going to commit some time to it.

The most productive way of learning, I found out, was just playing the game itself. You can select from a variety of players and as you play more games, you'll find out your true rating compared to the professionals. Chessmaster will also pitch similarly classed players against you but I found at every level, they were pretty smart; not prone to make any overtly stupid moves. The piece de resistance of this part is the fact that you can take back your moves anytime you want. Chessmaster won't punish you for it. And, the game has aids to show a lot of things to help you develop your game. You can have pieces that are threatened turn slightly transparent. A blunder monitor lets you know if you're about to expose your defense. It doesn't work constantly, per se. I've had it not warn me about some very bad moves but it keeps you on your toes. There's also a coach that'll constantly give predictions and analyze a defined number of moves ahead (by default it's ten) for you, so you can benefit from the artificial intelligence. But these aids are all in chess notation, so if you're not comfortable reading letters and numbers, you might want to try the analysis function which takes a few seconds timeout to churn out an end-game strategy for you. I'm not about to judge whether these strategies beat real computers like Deep Blue (in fact, they rarely work out the way the computer thinks it will) but I imagine it's doing something good if it chews up about 50% of my CPU time while I idle.

Chessmaster includes a comprehensive glossary of opening moves and defenses you can pull, organized by name. Savvy players can even search its libraries by moves. The best resource by far for learning is the classical library of chess matches included. It also happens to be the strength of this game, in my humble opinion. A number of brilliant matches from the 19th century up until last year are recorded here. Each game begins with a little blurb on how the match was setup and what its significance was to the world of chess. Chessmaster 9000 not only replays these classics but also offers analysis at crucial junctions. What if Kasparov did this instead of that against Deep Blue? How did Kramnik beat Kasparov to dethrone one of greatest chess players of our time? You can see it all play out and I only wished the chess mentor could offer such advice at critical junctures in my own games but that may be asking for too much.

Finally, Chessmaster 9000 plays its multiplayer over ubi.com, which supervises all the ranked and tournament games. You can also play directly over TCP/IP or LAN. Chessmaster's engine lets you save your moves at any time, even dump your game to ASCII boards, so it's great for people who need material to try to improve their game. But for novices, you might be better sticking with the parlor players unless you really want to improve your chess game."
3384,5,LOVE IT
3385,5,"This review is for the AmazonBasics Carrying Case for the Nintendo 3DS/DS Lite/DSi XL system. Overall, this case works very well. I personally use it for my 3DS XL, and it still fits perfectly. There are elastic straps inside to hold the system in place, plus a padded flap to hold 3 DS games. As a first case for a new DS owner, you can't go wrong for the price. I would however prefer to have a bigger game capacity- there definitely is room within the case for more, but only 3 elastic loops are sewn in. I will most likely purchase a separate case for games only. I am giving this case 5 stars, it fits my 3DS XL well, and protects it well too."
3386,5,Love it!
3387,5,Nice product.
3388,5,My grandkids live this game.
3389,5,This is one of the best offline first person shooters ever made. It's one of the last game to use BOTS and there are some pretty cool level designs and a ton of creative players and weapons. Single player mode is mediocre at best but the multi-player is great. Good buy for under $8.
3390,5,"Do you like Halo?  Then you probably already have this game.  At any rate, I thought 343 did a good job carrying the torch with this one.  The plot is a little confusing at times without finding the extra hidden easter eggs and playing through Spartan Ops, but the game looks great and the gameplay is well done.  The multiplayer is also very fun."
3391,5,"Battlefield 3 Premium Edition is a deal you cannot beat!

It comes with all of the extra bonus content that has been released so far in the series. With one more future expansion pack in the work. The DLC is in the online pass code, it grants you all of the DLC that has been out. You have to download it through the in-game menu, not the PSN Store/Xbox live marketplace. So that way you don't pay extra. I have to say though, be prepared to download a lot of stuff I have to say. All in all a great buy at the price I bought it for."
3392,5,I really am enjoying the story.  It looks amazing.  The characters are really funny.  Great game!
3393,5,"I bought this figure not even owning a Wii U.  I just love the 8-bit look of it and it looks great on my shelf as a collectible.  As for what it brings to a game, I have no clue."
3394,5,"This keyboard is priceless when trying to surf the web on the PS3.  In addition, any time you need to type letters this keyboard (or any usb keyboard for that matter) blows away using the onscreen keyboard and PS3 controller.  The keys are very much like a laptop keyboard.  If you are used to laptops, you won't have nay issues.

This keyboard has a nice scrolling trackpad and an on-off switch to conserver energy.  It is Blutooth enabled and therefore wireless.

Its sheen matches the PS3 perfectly."
3395,5,"I had the Nyko Charger for the Wii Remotes and even purchased a 2nd set.  That one works well enough, but since the remotes sit upright they do not always make the connection unless you play with it to get the contacts to sync up.  With this charge base, the controllers sit directly on top of the charge base and the weight of the controllers ensures that the contacts are solidly in place.  I like this one much better.  The battery packs are a bit larger, so they keep a charge for a good long time.  Definitely worth the purchase in my opinion."
3396,5,One of Wii's best games. A must have for Nintendo fans and gamers in general. One of the best Platforming games ever.
3397,5,"Big fun!  Great story!  It is a little hard at first.  I got tired of being killed by EVERYTHING!!! But after about 4-5 hours of play, I leveled up to a decent fighting machine and could enjoy the game."
3398,5,Ty works great!!
3399,5,This game is amazing so much detail best deal i got on amazon buy 2 get 1 free so if your looking for a great sports game this xmas nba2k14 is it.
3400,5,"I use this mouse everyday for non-gaming and gaming usages and I love it! Being able to bind windows options such as screen-saver and shutdown to certain buttons is a nice function to have. I can't use normal non-macro mice anymore without wanting to just bring this mice with me everywhere because it's so useful having macros at the touch of a finger. The RGB lighting is a nice addition too, and being able to go wireless is also useful for me since I have too many wires as is in my computer setup."
3401,5,"After receiving various awards since being a superstardom game for the N64 in 1998, this game looks more improving for the Nintendo 3DS as of up to this date. Perfect for beginners.

Pros:
 - Enhanced graphics and 3D visuals give a whole new spin on the game
 - Touch screen makes it easy to control inventory
 - Loads of secrets and some side-quests

Cons:
 - Navi is still the most annoying fairy in the world
 - Master Quest dungeons are too renovated and overwelming"
3402,5,Fun to play
3403,5,"I bought this for my son without reading about it, so I was a little sad that you play it with the remote and not by using motions. But now I can have four kids playing on the Xbox and the left out child can play on the Wii U gamepad."
3404,5,"I was wary to buy the game after reading several negative reviews, but thankfully I did anyway, and am fully satisfied. It is exactly what was promised, fast paced, mindless killing, That's even part of the damn story! ""Kill everything you see!"" It says to use CD #3 to start up, what the hell's wrong w/ that? And it runs perfectly, smooth and crisp. Just lower all the detail. A unique idea they added, which I love, is to completely customize your cross hair, minor but fun. The multiplayer is great. What else do you want for the genre? If you don't like mindless killing, go buy SOMETHING THAT ISN'T MINDLESS KILLING. There ya go, problem solved. dumasses"
3405,5,"Whenever the Uncharted series came out I owned a 360 so I never had a chance to play these games and man I missed out. The controls are good, the remastered graphics are good, and the story is awesome. It's definitely worth a buy for anyone that never played these."
3406,5,this came with everything i read in the description and now i can play real sega saturn games ur cool dude
3407,5,We bought this for our 7 year old son. He picked it out at game stop and I said not today then I looked it up on here and bought it wag cheaper and ordered it and surprised him with it and him and his siibgs all really like it.
3408,5,Meta Knight really got a killer figure with a good pose and high details. His paint is one of the best in the series of amiibos.
3409,5,If you want to transfer your PS2 game saves to your new PS3 you need this card. The latest PS3 software update has nothing to do with file transfer. You can write data to the card which can come in handy if your traveling.
3410,5,"To date this is easily the most fun ""Need for Speed"" title. Totally ungrounded in reality, this game was fun to just turn on and go as fast as absolutely possible!! As low price as this game is now there is NO reason why it shouldn't be in your library of classic games."
3411,5,Easy to install
3412,5,like that cable because is more used in the phone. Verry Good Good Good Verry Verry Good Good Verry Good
3413,5,"This is a good product, I like it"
3414,5,This is a great racer that reminds me of the Fast and Furious movies. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy - I use my keyboard/mouse.  Great music soundtrack as well. This racer is as good or better than the newer ones on the consoles. Rock On!
3415,5,"Jet X20 is one of the all time great racing games and the best downhill arcade style water racing game ever, in my opinion.  It's like Sled Storm on water.  The tracks are super fun, challenging, and the AI is pretty tough.  If I had one quibble it would be that I would like the water craft to be in boost mode longer (meaning that once you get into boost mode which speeds up your craft to break neck fast, you don't want it to slow down).

For any of you that played and loved hydro thunder, Jet X20 is exactly like that except faster, and all out fun. The trick system is really fun when you get the hang of it, and some of the drops are so steep, that it feels like you're actually falling hundreds of feet off of a cliff face, etc... If pure simulation is your thing, then I would not recommend this game.  But for those who like super realistic water effects combined with rocket fast and fun gameplay arcade style, this is your game.

I purchased in connection with this game, the Action Max Replay cheat code disc, which recognizes the game after you insert the disc.  One of the cheat codes is never losing your boost.  It has made the game perfect in every respect, and I would recommend that also.  Hope you enjoy the game as much as I do. Thanks for reading.  I heve included a link to the cheat code disc that I use for this (and many of my other racing games)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Datel-Max-Playstation-2-Action-Replay/dp/B001UIG6M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Datel Max Playstation 2 Action Replay</a>"
3416,5,"this item works well I like it.
I would buy this again."
3417,5,The cables outer casing is tough and rigid. It charges my system well and arrived on time anvil well packaged.  Highly recommend!
3418,5,Just got this game and let me say this game is very good so far. 5/5
3419,5,Items work as described
3420,5,"Bought this for my grandson. He really wanted this for his games. Saved on money for this too!!!
That's always a plus. Glad I purchased it for him."
3421,5,"I bought this game over four years ago and just have to say I must of replayed this game at least a dozen times (Start-Finish). This game was one of the major reasons I bought an Xbox then an Xbox 360. If you like to play shooters this game is for you.

The graphics even by today's standards are very good. The campaign is best thought out story I have ever seen even better than movies. The only thing this game lacks is online play but this game was released just before Xbox Live came out. If you want to play online get the PC version or buy Halo 2. Once you beat this game get Halo 2 it was also an extremely good game. Halo 3 will be on sale for the Xbox 360 in a year hopefully less."
3422,5,One of the most challenging and rewarding games I have ever experienced. I will always recall this as one of my favorite games ever.
3423,5,"Wow.  This game was like participating in an awesome drama/action movie.  The voice acting is incredible, the story really takes you in, it looks amazing, and the multiplayer is worth playing.  Naughty Dog rocks.

I'm a trophy hunter, and there was ONE problem that drove me to the point of almost not getting platinum.  The 'optional conversations' trophy.  Reading online for the ps3 version the issue is the same of getting 36/37.  I had to delete my game profile and restart all progress.  It is my fifth play through on the story so that says a lot in itself."
3424,5,A must have for anyone who owns an Xbox one.  This controller comes with a rechargeable battery pack and a very long and sturdy USB to Micro USB wire.
3425,5,"They ruined a few small things that were popular in the original, but overall the game was fun in its own experience.

Some cons though: cannot pick up other guns, causes you to run out of ammo quickly with the sniper rifle; checkpoint saving only, which means you have to replay hard areas multiple times.

good points though:very challenging, ultra realistic.
 if you like run and gun style games like old school MOHAA, then this is NOT your game."
3426,5,"The gameplay can be a little slow (depending on how you play it; I play slow, but once I got used to it, I was dropping traps like BAM!!)

A la Rube Goldberg machine-esque fun.
This game needs quite a bit of tinkering, trial, error and imagination to pull off some amazing combo traps.
The story is quite good and the characters are wacky and funny.
Its fun experimenting with the different traps available.

I loved the game and character designs.
If you like a game where you can set your own pace and love goldberg contraptions (and feel like a general badass) then I recommend you give the game a try!"
3427,5,"Well let me start off by saying that I try not to buy into the hype of games anymore after the slight letdown that was Halo 3 and the huge letdown that was Army of Two for me. And for the most part while first hearing about GTA4 I was not all that interested in picking it up. But then the reviews started coming out and I began to read, and read some more. My interest peaked up a little bit and I decided to go and pick up the game on release night.
And seeing as how with a few trade ins I got it for literally nothing I guess there really wasn't much to lose.

Boy am I glad I did, not only does this game live up to every thing the reviews have stated about it, it pretty much surpasses my expectations by a landslide.
By far one of the most complete games I have played in quite a while and it does not leave much for me to desire.

I haven't had any graphical slowdown or popins that I have noticed as stated in some reviews. No tech problems with the game locking up as I have been hearing people talk about. The controls took a little bit of getting used to because they aimed for a bit more realism than in the past GTA games, so driving is a little odd at first.

I love the story down to the last detail and while I have not finished it yet, I have been making nightly progress.

The multiplayer is absolutely great, mainly because of the ability to wage your battles and races in any part of the entire city.
I find Team deathmatch to be the most entertaining because no 2 games are ever really the same because the fights are always in different areas.

Free roam is some serious fun although I do wish they had added some more customization options that you could turn on or off for free mode, maybe to give you different things you can do (I.E. Zombie mod anyone?)
But who knows what will come with future DLC on Xbox live.

Everything in the graphics is great down to the little details like most of the pedestrians actually appearing different in different areas of the game. You really get a feel for the economic situations in the city as you are roaming around. As well as small things some people may not even notice like when driving around with Little Jacob and seeing the smoke from his joint pouring out a car window if its broken out. To the great effects of the water on the ground after it has finished raining.

And while I can't say enough good things about what I love in this game, there  will never be a review that will let you see how it truly is to play it. Go out and rent it, buy it, give it a shot.

And a side note to parents buying this game for kids, I personally would not recommend it, it is rated mature for a reason and I'm sick and tired of hearing people come on the news attacking this game for all the things it lets you do. There is continuous subject matter which really should not be viewed by younger kids. While it is up to the parent to decide, do so with caution and read up first before making that decision."
3428,5,Great game lots of fun.
3429,5,Nice product!
3430,5,"I was worried that this inexpensive replacement woudn't work well, but it's held up well.  Don't spend more for the original, this one works fine."
3431,5,"First off i have to say that i love tactical RPGs and other then Disgaea Hour of Darkness and Final Fantasy Tactics this collection is as good as it gets. It surprises me a little that it has taken this long for a U.S. release and after playing Growlanser i'm hoping that sonner or latter the first game will make it stateside as well. (Maybe for the PSP? - God knows it needs some real RPGs)

While the game certainly isn't graphically impressive (if you're reading this you're probably a real gamer anyway so you won't care) everything else about this collection has awesome depth despite being rather simplistic structurally compared to games such as Disgaea and Phantom Brave.

As soon as i found out that this collection was developed by Working Designs and Atlus (the two most underrated developers in the gaming world) i had to buy it and if you're even remotely interested in tactical RPGs do yourself a favor and buy it. You won't be dissapointed.

Great combat, great story, great value."
3432,5,"This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. I'm a 30YO woman who has been playing video games for a long time. I've played and still play on various platforms. I personally prefer turn based RPG so I didn't initially give the Splatoon game a chance.

My two kids ages 4 and 11 both play the online and campaign modes. My husband has beat the campaign mode several times and plays online. My 11 year old has beat all but the final boss on the campaign mode.

I'm glad I personally decided to give Splatoon a chance. I've always struggled with the controls for live action games. This has helped me develop my gaming skills. I really normally handcuffed myself to turn based combat games so I've been limited on what I could play. I'm now a level 34 on the online mode and I normally finish 1st or 2nd.

I think this game is a major success for Nintendo. It's enjoyable for a toddler, pre-teen, and two adults in our 30's. It bridges the new gamers with original gamers. It helped me overcome my limitations and got me interested in more than just turn based battle systems. I thought I was too ""old"" to learn a new battle system.

Before playing Splatoon I also didn't enjoy having to manually turn the camera during live action. After playing Splatoon I can now do this with ease. Splatoon does have a mode where it automatically controls the camera for you. Being someone who always struggled with that I thought I would enjoy this feature. I don't at all. It made me motion sick. I had to turn it off and use manual controls. Once you get used to it you don't even notice you are doing it.

I love the game play, controls, and art. The community is also a nice part about playing this game. Nintendo did a good job keeping the community family friendly."
3433,5,"This game only disappointed me in a couple of minor areas. First, it took me awhile to get used to the movement because your character can only move in four distinct directions as opposed to eight or so in HM64. Second, the music just didn't live up to HM64 in my opinion and I realize that is highly subjective. Everything else this game does better, from the increase in crops to the addition of more tools and the ability to create the food from the recipes that you find. If you are a fan of the Harvest Moon series and especially if you loved HM64, give this title a play-through if you can find it for a decent price."
3434,5,Works like a charm
3435,5,Great sports fun for the PlayStation.  Graphics are well done.
3436,5,"I grew up loving Pokemon, I had Red/Yellow/Silver/heart gold/pokemon snap/pokemon stadium, the cards etc. It has been a few years since I have bought/played one of these games. The last one I bought was Heart Gold, and it was just so-so. I found that I wasn't as excited as I was as a kid, which probably is a good thing since I'm a little old to be playing video games anymore. So, I bought my kids some used DS systems, and they came with some games. Pokemon White was one of them. I was sick and down for a good week and decided that I wanted to try the Pokemon White game just for some silly down time. It was like being a ten year old girl all over again, the excitement and wanting to stay up all night playing. I really enjoyed the story, I think if I would have been younger playing this I may not have enjoyed it as much as I did. I think I would have been annoyed with the opposing ideas in the game. But the story gave the game a whole new dimension it didn't have before, enough so to make me excited about pokemon again. I finished this game basically within a week and decided I wanted more! I bought the sequel...But so far it's not as I had hoped. Pokemon White so far has been my favorite out of the pokemon games, and that is saying a lot considering how much I loved Pokemon Snap as a kid. This was a fun way to reconnect to a part of my life that I thought was gone for good. It was fun to put aside my adult tendencies and be an excited kid staying up under the covers with a game all night. My kids are also enjoying that we are going back and watching all the old Pokemon shows, haha. Great game!"
3437,5,"A must have for Xbox 360 owners! Crackdown 2 is not only far-better than the first Crackdown, but with an open-ended world waiting for you to explore and multiple enemy types to destroy along with a plethra of weapons and cars at your disposal makes this one of my favorate action games on the Xbox 360. Looks great in hi-def as well."
3438,5,"I thought I was getting tired of the zombie theme, but then I played this little gem.  The survival aspect just makes this game the way it is.  That being, this isn't an easy game.  It will get easier, but the difficulty isn't a joke.  This isn't another ""head-blasting zombie game,"" and a lot of thought is needed to keep yourself alive.  This is also a great reason to search for craftable items, as they will definitely be handy.  Your main mode of attacking is either kicking or using melee weapons, which means if you find a gun, you better save it for later.  Ammo is virtually nonexistant in the game, and they should only be used in emergency situations, so no run and gun here at all.  Night can also prove to be your enemy, as not only will the enemies get stronger, but you also have to worry about Volatiles, which are freaks of the freaks of natures, and your only option against these guys is to run like your in 5K marathon.  I also feel like the parkour is excellent, and it adds a lot more freedom in the open world map it has.  It may not work all the time, mostly when you're in a rush, but as long as you're looking at the ledge you want to climb, you shouldn't have no problems.  All in all, I can't really find anything wrong with the game that will affect your playing experience.  Many people say the story isn't really anything to brag about, and there are times I notice when the game goes 30 FPS to a very short but noticeable hike, which can distract from the pretty good visuals it has.  Other than that, this game is close to flawless to me.  If you want a zombie game, but you also want a challenging game, this is it.  Heck, I feel like this game is a welcoming surprise, considering that I just keep going back to it."
3439,5,"Fun game.  Controls and moves are easy to learn, nice graphics, good story, length is fine.  Where the game really shines is in its puzzles, environments, and level design.  It seems a lot of thought went into these, especially in the Jan Mayen Island and Arctic Sea levels and the Lara's Shadow add-on (all of which are fantastic).  Criticisms that the levels are confusing are overstated IMO.  You do have to explore the area to figure out what to do next but that's part of the appeal of adventure games.  My only complaint is that the camera angles fly here and there (I would like to give the game a 4.5 out of 5 for this reason) but it's not bad enough to be frustrating (just mildly annoying).

I paid full price for the game when it was released last year and don't regret it.  At $20, it's a bargain for fans of the series or anyone who is looking for an alternative to first person shooters."
3440,5,I bought this game at GameStop today and I started playing it and I loved it! Rayman Origins is a great game and it's very fun and cute! This game is very addicting and gets 5 stars! As a Rayman fan since 2003 Rayman Origins is excellent and gets 10/10 this game is perfect for any Rayman fan out there! 
3441,5,"This mouse is awesome. I use it from everyday use to hard gaming sessions. I enjoy the fact that I can change the DPI on the fly while using it. This is really handy for FPS games I can go from fast to more control movements with the camera. Also when you change the DPI the background color of the mouse changes with it. The top two buttons next to the DPI changer are the forward/backwards buttons, on the left where your thumb rests is a fire button which is also pretty convenient that allows me to fire with the same hand as the camera rather than taking up another finger for my left hand. Works great on wood, leather, marble, and its OK on glad but don't recommend it. The cord is of more than sufficient length for where I have my computer and mouse pad. I would buy again and recommend to others looking for a good gaming/everyday mouse"
3442,5,"Oh yeah! DDR has to be the #1 party game of all party games! Who cares about playing in the arcade?  You can get this game for 50 dollars and if u played for over 50 times then it is like u paid 50 dollars top play in the arcade then it is like you are now playin for free!  If you play DDR Extreme my favorite song is Freckles and 321 Stars. ""One two one two one two one two one two!  This game will make you stay fit without having to go outside! So if your parents are complaining that you're not getting any excercise and your a video game fantic this game is perfect for you!  So what are you waiting for? Let's DDR!"
3443,5,I didn't know I would love Legend of Zelda since I am a tetris/mario/phoenix wright kind-of-girl. Anyway I start to fall in love with Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past as the game grows on me (with some help from the game guide). Cannot wait for Legend of Zelda: the Phantom Hourglass to come home (I pre-ordered it already!)
3444,5,Great Game
3445,5,"this game is very fun, plays quickly and offer a lot new features, wish it was longer though but the game is a little more difficult than the previous resident evils but still fun."
3446,5,"I'm an avid gamer, with a wide variety of games in my library - and I can say this confidently: Shin Negami Tensei: Person 3: FES is a game for EVERYBODY. Also, the ""FES"" in the title implies that this is a later iteration of the game, and that implication is correct. A LOT of new content is added from the original including new social links, personas, and a whole 30+ hour extra game that takes place after the events of the original."
3447,5,Product works as described and arrived in a timely manor!
3448,5,It work just fine. I love it.
3449,5,Works great
3450,5,awsome
3451,5,Memories came back with this game !!! Just hoping Marcus comes back in Gears 4
3452,5,"This is a good product.
Sturdy construction, works flawlessly.

Well worth the price, especially when you look at the cost of new controllers.  Just be careful not to trip on the cord."
3453,5,"Let's face it, working out is a karma for most of us, we know we need it, we know it makes us good but we're to lazy to get into a routine, specially during the cold months. I've always been aware of this and have been very inconstant on my gym attempts. I find working out very boring and enslaving but when you enjoy something you just want to do it every day, that's what happens to me during the warm months when I'm able to play some soccer and I don't even mind or get lazy about it.

Same thing that happens to me with the sports I enjoy, is what happens with the Wii fit U, it is so fun, I don't even think I'm working out and it challenges me to get more calories into the calories bank. My wife thinks this is the best game ever and I'm happy we're motivated every day to get active.

The game is so complete with tons of games so it never becomes monotonous and great tools that give you accurate info about your body and help you challenge yourself to achieve your fitness goals.

The fit meter is a great addition on this version because it is an additional motivation to go outside an run. I also find the run and altitude challenges very interesting.

Thank you Nintendo for this great tool, a must have for every healthy family."
3454,5,"I unfortunately decided I wanted a Pink DS a week before Christmas.  What a mistake that seemed to be at the time.  So I was trying to convince myself I would be happy with any color.  Which still seemed an impossibility since this seems to be one of the top toys for Christmas.  So I then was trying to convince myself to get an Ipod instead.  But I wouldn't have been happy without a pink DS so I was ready to not get it for Christmas when amazingly enough we found a few pink ones at walmart.

I got it for Christmas and have had a hard time putting it down since.  I love the stylus and the games that make more use of it.  It just seems like my hands hurt less.  I thought the DS wouldn't last when they first came out but I'm a convert now.  It's great."
3455,5,OK
3456,5,"I'm not sure why the other people don't like this game, it's SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!  Yes it's challenging. Well, duh. Do you want a game that's so easy that you get through it fast? no. Do you want a game that's kinda challenging so it takes u 3 times to do each board so you finish it not too fast, but quick? eh, no.

The game is challenging. Not right away, but of course you have to get used to it. This is more than just a game to blow stuff up and go nuts. This is a really challenging puzzler in a different format. There's specific targets, various forms of elemental destruction, items that make your tornado/lightning/hail storm increase a level of power, magnitude and destructive capability. I got to the 4th week and it gets harder and harder. But extremely fun, challenging, frustrating of course (which all good games do because you gotta keep trying, oh no, not trying!) Take it from me, the game really does kick-butt. Without realizing it, you'll spend a lot of time on it trying to destroy as much as possible, trying different paths of blowing stuff up.

Not for young kids, unless they love puzzlers. Find it used if your curious at gamestop. It's totally worth it."
3457,5,Good
3458,5,The zapper gun will always be one of Nintendo's finest contribution to the world of gaming. It's a shame they made so few games that require it. Imagine Mario Brothers with a gun. But it never happened. Hours of fun that will really take you back to the early days of gaming. I highly recommend it!
3459,5,Works Great!
3460,5,I have been playing the game off and on for years. Beware this is a life-robbing ridiculously addictive game. I logged literally hundreds of hours leveling up my characters  then later using trainers(so unfair to the poor monsters) .I have completed the game 8 times with different combinations of masteries. Dream mastery is the best. I am simultaneously going through the game with a warfare/nature mastery character not realizing that i had already trained up a rouge/nature character that loved to play with. Now I will have to get rid of one and create a new character without the nature master cause the game is redundant enough. Still its insanely fun to play. Don't use a trainer to beat it unless you have beaten it with every mastery.
3461,5,"Super!, Great game!, as Advertise!"
3462,5,"OK, so Final Fantasy VI is still my favorite, but I can't say enough about FF8.  The reason is that the story is incredible.  I don't think I have ever played an FF game that has as well defined story as this.  The romance between Squall and Riona is great.  It actually got me involved and made truly empathize with the characters, especially when Squall rescues Riona on Disk 3.  Also, the story of Siefer and his one-man war against Squall only heightened the drama as you go through the game.  The portion about the orphanage was a bit hokey, though I can understand where it fit into the rest of the storyline.  But, by far, the best part is the love story.  Again, I don't think I have ever seen an FF game that has as dynamic characters as this one.  Wow.  I just can't say enough about it without giving too much of the story away.  On a negative side, this one still uses the 3D characters from FF7 as opposed to the overhead, less realistic views that were common of the FF games I grew up on.  And, probably the most fun thing about Final Fantasy games is missing in this one: you can't rename the characters, and with FFX having voice overs with the character's names in them, I guess that will never come back.  But that was the most fun part: renaming all the characters with your friend's names.  But still, for playability, this is one of the best editions out there, and I just don't see how, aside from general graphical improvements during the regular scenes, it could be improved upon.  This one is great.  Buy it, play it, and enjoy it."
3463,5,"Surprisingly, it's a fun turn based JRPG with a interesting battle system. I've heard some mixed reviews (average to negative mostly)on other sites, mostly criticizing the BGM being slightly repetitive at times. Other than that I couldn't think of any other cons to this game, it was just a fun RPG that picks up once you grind a bit(skipping sequences kills it though..)and eventually unlock characters. Great characters with funny voices in Jap audio (dual audio as well :) ), the plot isn't the best I've seen, but it was alright. You can't compare this game to stuff like Xenosaga or Persona 3 FES, but it's still a fun game to play, I liked it ^_^ ."
3464,5,works really well i've had it for a while and it hasn't broken
3465,5,aww
3466,5,Purchased as a gift.
3467,5,"If you're looking for TONS of power in a small package, you found a great choice. This could be the smallest 13000mAh battery I've ever tested. It's still pretty hefty, but you can easily take this large power bank with you everywhere.

The 2 amp port provided about 33%/hour charge on my Lumia 735, which is good, but the charging speed didn't overly impress me. The style is simple, but that's the way it should be. Unfortunately, the built in flash light was anything but simple. It worked erratically for me. Sometimes it would turn on just fine, and sometimes it wouldn't even turn off. Work on fixing that, ZiLu.

The power bank also comes with a micro USB cord, but keep in mind that it's only about 1 foot long... so you might want to use your own charging cords.

Overall, I really enjoyed using this power bank. It kept my phone charged for an entire week, which could really come in handy for those long days or when the power goes out for an extended period.

ZiLu sent me a sample for review. I hope this review was helpful!"
3468,5,A+
3469,5,Great game.
3470,5,
3471,5,One star reviewer never played this cause this and epic yarn play different. First off this plays like a classic yoshi game platformer you eat things and turn them into i guess eggs that you aim at enemies and objects. Yoshi's tongue also unravels objects and parts of enemies and bosses so they come apart like yarn. This game shares obviously a world much like Mario's games so there are similar play elements. The graphics are really good the game has a way more realistic yarn look than LBP a gme which I also love to play. You can see the tiny strands that you'd see in real life on yarn. The colors and the detail are amazing one of the best looking sidescrollers in recent time. The sound and music is spot on. I don't see really any flaws after the hours and hours of play. The wii u may lack quantity but the quality of the exclusives is just triple A. I think those who have over looked the wii u or are have their fanboy blinders on are seriously missing out
3472,5,Beyond words Awesome gaaaaaaaaame!!
3473,5,Workerd well and lasted as long as we  thought it  should with no problems.
3474,5,10/10
3475,5,"Great controller!  A necessity for any game.  I fatigue much faster, when playing with the Wii U tablet control."
3476,5,"Living life, and playing life. How fun!"
3477,5,7 year old daughter and 14 year old son love this game they play for hours finding and trading Pokemon.
3478,5,5 Stars
3479,5,"This game is fun, especially if you have people to play with. The movements are pretty accurate, for the most part, and the games are addicting. It is great exercise and fun for all ages."
3480,5,Love this case. Its perfect for my son's 3DS XL even with the clear Duraflexi protector on. I love that it fits so many games.
3481,5,"Good quality, works also for European electrical network. I'm fully satisfied"
3482,5,"I played the first galaxy and like it, but the second is much better, more levels, challenges and a lot of nostalgic."
3483,5,GOT THIS WITH NO PROBLEMS AND IT WORKS GREAT. THIS IS THE SECOND ZELDA GAME I PLAYED GROWING UP. EVEN THOUGH THE GRAPHICS ARE OUTDATED IT STILL ENJOY THIS GAME. AFTER PLAYING THE GAMES OF TODAY THE ONLY FAULT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS ONE IS THE SIDE SCOLLING . GUESS I GOT USE TO THE 3D EFFECT. BUT THE FUN IS NO LESS.
3484,5,"This is even better than the first Oddworld. So many things to do, things to see, and things to fart on! Your story as Abe continues, when the greedy Glukkon's start grinding up the bones of your dead people, to make Beer! You gotta get this! it's great, one of the best games i've ever played. Unlike the first, you can take control of, Glukkon's! The Greedy Main baddies, an you can be em'! Or, just watch them explode when you release them from mind control."
3485,5,This game is great. It provides challenge. It has coop but its not like coop in halo or cod where the other people are just there to be there. You have to rely on your partner. The AI in this game is great. The story is not bad. The characters are humerous yet deadly. The graphics are pretty good even 4 years later. This game is much better than mainstream shooters like cod and bf. I cant wait to play 40th day and devils cartel.
3486,5,This headset has amazing quality in chat both on PC and PS3. My fellow PC friends keep complimenting the sound quality.
3487,5,great game
3488,5,"I remember playing the original flight simulator on the Apple II computer.  I'm amazed at how far this software has come.  Granted, not much has changed since Flight Simulator 98, but this is a better product.
If you are thinking of taking flight lessons, this software can help you learn and save money along the way, especially if you are aiming for an instrument rating later on.  For individuals who don't know much about flight, there are introductory and interactive lessons to step you through learning how to fly.  You also have the opportunity to take a test.  Pass and you can get a certificate of achievement.
The sceneries are not very realistic, with the exception of well-traveled routes or well-known landmarks (or the major airports).  Most of the scenery is auto generated and populated at runtime.  If you want realism, you'll have to purchase a 3rd party add-on or develop your own scenery (not a very well documented or easy thing to do).
Surprisingly, the ATC is realistic in an idealistic kind of way.  Downloadable real-time weather is a great feature.  The multiplayer function is basically useless.
You really need a joystick (or yoke).  Controlling the aircraft with only the keyboard is a sadistic experience.  Flying the helicopter without a joystick (only keyboard) would be almost impossible.
In summary, it's a great game, but I would wait for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, which will be out next month."
3489,5,"Pros:

+Reissue of one of the best Playstation 2 games.
+A good storyline
+A beautiful and stylish game
+Incredible soundtrack
+Wii Controls work well

Cons:

-There aren't any Wii Exclusive Extras
-No voice acting, though this isn't a big issue
-If you own this game on the Playstation 2, the new controls probably don't justify buying the game

In 2006, Capcom released Okami.  It's a game that didn't have a long lifespan, despite being on the PS2.  It has commonly gone on to be labeled one of the most underrated (and probably underplayed) games of all time.  However, it quickly garnered a cult following.  For anyone who missed the Playstation 2 version, here's a chance to play it on the Wii.  Even if you played the Playstation 2 version to death, Okami on the Wii is worth giving a try.

You play as Amaterasu.  She's the Sun God of Japan and must now save the it from being overtaken by an evil curse that has spread across the land.  Amaterasu is joined by her companion Issun.  The overall story of Okami is brilliant.  It's told through text dialog with no voice acting to speak of.  While there's some garbled gibberish going on when the words appear on screen, there's no voice acting whatsoever.  This is forgivable, though.  What may throw some people however, is that some of the games cutscenes are pretty long, and they're pretty text heavy.

When it comes to graphics there are some games that put style over substance and some that put substance over style.  Okami manages to do both.  Not only is the game one of the most beautiful looking games ever released on a video game platform, it's also incredibly stylish, colorful, and detailed.  Despite being released in 2006, Okami still manages to be one of the best looking games out there.  Even today, there are few games that look as good as Okami does.  From time to time you may just want to stop your progress and admire the game's beauty.

In terms of gameplay, Okami is very reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda games.  You'll go into dungeons and villages and battle bad guys and solve puzzles most of the time.  Combat itself is fairly simple, and the Wii controls are actually pretty good here.  You'll flick the Wii Remote to attack and you can use the Nunchuck to dodge.  For the most part, the controls are pretty similar to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  Combat is also pretty simple.  Even against the bosses.  It's very unlikely you'll die even once through Okami.  The biggest draw to Okami, however, and the main reason it makes sense to release this game on the Wii, is the Celestial Brush.

The Celestial Brush is more than just a gimmick.  You'll need it to get through much of the game's moments and you'll find you have to use it very often.  Using the brush you can do things like, make the sun come out when it's dark, or cut through stone.  You'll gather more skills as you traverse through the game.  You'll even need to use it in combat to defeat enemies.  What makes the Wii Version so much better is that actions with the celestial brush can be executed much faster than could be done on the Playstation 2 version.  The moment you start using the Wii Remote as a paint brush, you probably won't want to go back to using an analog stick for the task again.

If there was any problem concerning the gameplay, it would be that the controls take time to get used to and that they do not always respond.  The controls work well, but stringing together attacks can be a problem sometimes.  When you finally get the rhythm down, though, the controls are pretty solid.

There may not be any voice acting in Okami, but there is a fantastic soundtrack at work.  There are still few games that sound as good as Okami does.  Part of what helps the music, however, is that it really gets you absorbed into this world.  More so than most video games.  The adventure also lasts for quite some time, but it isn't boring and just when you're positive you've mastered everything there is to master, the game throws in another mechanic to keep it interesting.

The only major thing holding Okami back, really, is the lack of Wii exclusive extras.  It's worth trying the game if you played through the Playstation 2 version.  On the other hand, it might not be worth buying just for the controls alone if you've still got your original copy.

The good news, however, is Okami has aged well.  Even by today's standards, the game is fresh."
3490,5,My uncle had an actually Atari system and I remember playing it when I was a kid. I bought the PS2 version at a dollar store for $15 a few years ago. There are 85 games total and I've had a blast playing them.
3491,5,I love the XBOX One and Unity was a pretty good game... mot of the bugs had been worked out by the time I got it.
3492,5,"This is one of the greatest tranfers from arcade to home system. The graphics indeed look almost just like the arcade and the sound is the part where it will shock you because we all thought the 64 couldn't handle such quality arcade stereo type of music but the 64 was able to handle it!!! Everything is there except for Jago's spirt move and some back grounds were altered. The bad thing is that due to nin 64's limited capacity of memory, the cool cinemas were taken out and each character is limited to one ending instead. But still alot codes and secrets make this game worth playing and of course when you unleash the ultra combos-sit back and watch it's gonna be a bumpy ride. Have a nice day."
3493,5,Awesome!
3494,5,It didn't come on the day it was promised but other than that it's a pretty good headset
3495,5,"I will try and keep this short and to the point. Basicly Morrowind has 3 good things about it and 3 bad things. See if any of the good things are what you want in an RPG game beore you buy it.
1. Freedom at last: Many games (in fact all games that I've played) have a victory or game end. Morrowind doesn't have an end. In fact there isn't anything you HAVE to do (the main quest is optional.) You can do ANYTHING you want to.
2. Steal all you want: You can take anything you want! From stealing stuff in containers to ""liberating"" items off people. The only real hard part is not getting caught.
3. Interaction: You can talk to any character in the game (note that people who want to kill you will not talk.) You can ask people for directions and information. You can talk to them about something in general (like the latest rumors) or somthing more directed (like ""do you know anyone with this name."")
The 3 maybe 1 or 2 bad things are whatever you don't like about the 3 good things. Enjoy the game (if you want it.)"
3496,5,"Alot of other reviewers have used words such as incredible and amazing to describe Call Of Duty, and those words are well merrited.  It's rare that a game comes along that is so well made, so engulfing, that you forget you're only playing a game.  Not only has this game raised the bar for first person shooters, it's changed the way they're played completly.

While games such as ""Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault"" were well made and fun, they lacked the true experience of war.  With Call Of Duty it's hard not to believe you're in the second world war.  Whether you're leading a squad of American Paratroopers in an assault on a French town occupied by the Germans, a British SAS Commando attempting to hold the Pegasus Bridge, or leading Soviet Tanks in the blitz to Berlin you feel like you're living it.  But what really makes the experience complete are your fellow soldiers, with some of the best friendly AI this gamer has ever seen.  You won't have to babysit them because they can hold their own, but if you want to live you'd better work with them.

The multiplayer is good, while nothing earth shattering it can hold it's own and is a bit more on the realistic tip then Day Of Defeat or Battlefield 1942.  However, with the recently released United Offensive expansion gamers will now be able to use tanks, jeeps and more in multiplayer modes, which will most likely change the gameplay for better.

You'll cringe as the bullets from a German MG-42 whiz past your head.  Your hand will go numb from clutching your mouse too tight as you try to fend off dive-bombing Stukkas.  Bust most of all, you'll have fun."
3497,5,"This has got to be one of the most addictive games I have ever played. There is just way too much to do in it, you feel a need to keep playing. Plus the infinite lives is nice, too. I have yet to find a complaint about this game. Everything in it is just how I would have wanted it. Okay, fine, I'll be picky: There's no intro movie. Oh, horrors. Like that even matters.
The game lets you do whatever you want. You can flip off other drivers and cops, you can run over annoying people or just get out and beat them up with your fists (I suppose you could always shoot them too, but that's no fun, now is it?)
The car collisions are fairly realistic (at least for arcade)and the vehicle's damage is rather well done. The cars in the game are modeled closely after real cars, but with slight differences for copywright safety. In addition, the radio feature adds a touch of humor to your carnage (*cough* Chatterbox *cough*).
All in all, a really fun (yet violent) game that combines racing with pain. Woohoo!"
3498,5,"This game is a split between GTA4, Saints Row, and something all its own. It has the graphics only better'd by GTA4(but not much), the tons of weapons and fast paced action of SR with none of the bad. The only thing I can say is GTA4 has better gun and driving contols and physics; but this game trades that off with better flying and much more fun! The vast area is really impressive. I mean it make Oblivion look like tiny, GTA 4 look small, and I mean I've played for 4 hours now and seen maybe half of the island... By a jet. I feel like I can't even properly review it. 400 square miles of great graphics, changing weather and millions of opions. I highly recomend this game. Over anything else out right now.

3500,5,"Talk about throwback! I love this game, and my 3 year old loves watching me play it! So glad to find a $15 retro Nintendo console to play all my old games and to add this one to the stack!"
3501,5,"I just finished replaying DRAKE'S FORTUNE, the first game in what is for the moment the Nathan Drake trilogy (the fourth UNCHARTED game comes out in March 2016), for the first time since first buying the PS3 version of the game. DRAKE'S FORTUNE is really the test case for this set, since both UNCHARTED 2 - by strong consensus one of the two or three greatest PS3 games ever made - and UNCHARTED 3 both looked great on PS3. My impressions? Let's just say that I find the results absolutely stunning.

Naughty Dog at this point has to be considered one of - and most probably THE - greatest game developer of all time. If you look at lists of the greatest games for the original Playstation, the PS2, and the PS3, Naughty Dog titles dominate the Top Ten of each generation. The only reason that UNCHARTED 2 doesn't get the nod for best PS3 game is that another Naughty Dog IP, THE LAST OF US, takes the top spot. At this point they have had four phenomenally successful series, with THE LAST OF US almost certainly to be the next (I know some speculate that there will not be a TLOU 2, but while an independent company, they are funded and owned by Sony, and there is simply no way that Sony will tolerate there not being a follow up to a game that ultimately won nearly 250 Game of the Year Awards.

But as brilliant as Naughty Dog has been, they were not responsible for this brilliant upgrade to the UNCHARTED series. At this point the entire resources of Naughty Dog, as it has been for some time, completely devoted to UNCHARTED 4, though there are rumors that there is a smaller group working on a TLOU sequel. Work on the film version of THE LAST OF US, to be produced by Sam Raimi, has been put on hold so that Neil Druckman can finish his part on UNCHARTED 4. When it is done he'll do the final version of the film screenplay. In short, the good people at Naughty Dog have had their hands full. They have not even been able to work on the updating of one of their earlier franchises, Ratchet and Clank, in anticipation of the upcoming feature film based on that game. So Naughty Dog has outsourced, and the company responsible for the jaw dropping updating of UNCHARTED is Bluepoint. They have provided UNCHARTED with the PS4 upgrade that it so richly deserved.

Naughty Dog's goal has always been to provide a gaming experience in which the story was as important as the game play. Almost every developer gives lip service to the idea of a good story, but the truth is that most games have terrible stories. All of Naughty Dog's games have at least decent stories, but it was with the Uncharted series that they made their first serious attempt to create a game that provided a near cinematic experience. Some have complained that they rely too heavily on cut scenes, or that their games are too linear, limiting how open-ended the gaming worlds can be. My take on this is that open-ended games aren't really as open-ended as they want you to believe. I've been a huge FALLOUT fan over the years, but while FALLOUT 3 and FALLOUT NEW VEGAS had extremely open-worlds, once it came to wrapping up the narrative, you irresistibly were drawn to some very specific conclusions. Moreover, I'm not aware of an open-world game that was also truly open in terms of narrative that had a story worth talking about. THE WITCHER 3 has an open-world, but the truth is that without the absolutely astonishing gameplay, it would have been a thundering disappointment. Like UNCHARTED it relies on cut scenes at key points, and unlike UNCHARTED, its cut scenes are an abomination (with sex scenes that prove once again that computer games do sex poorly). To illustrate just how well UNCHARTED handles narrative, contrast the horrid sex scenes in THE WITCHER 3, which invariably fail to be sexy, with the sexual tension between Nate and Chloe on the one hand and Nate and Elena on the other. Chloe's instinctual jealousy of Elena alters the narrative in UNCHARTED 2, the first half of the game pairing Nate and Chloe and the second half pairing Nate and Elena, to the point where the purely professional relationship between the former becomes unglued. Sexual relations in UNCHARTED 2 are navigated in a way that rivals some of the great comedies of remarriage of the Thirties and Forties, with UNCHARTED 3 actually becoming a story of remarriage, with Nathan and Elena apparently having married sometime after the events of UNCHARTED 2, only to have separated just prior to UNCHARTED 3. There is intricate symbolism involving rings in that game, with Nate trying to recover the ring he wears around his neck for most of the series. Elena, working as a journalist in the Middle East, continues to wear her wedding ring, though, she is quick to add,only for professional reasons. A subtext of the game is whether Nate is willing to give up the Sir Francis Drake ring he wears through the first three games of the series. The third game ends with Nate symbolically giving up the adventuring life by being willing to lose his ring, exchanging it for one he will wear with Elena.

Now, this isn't what most people mean when they talk about the games being cinematic. But it is what strikes me as being cinematic. Sure, there are the big set pieces, such as the scene where Elena drives a jeep underneath a gigantic transport plane, getting into place immediately before the front tire leaves the runway. Executed correctly, you get this pure adrenaline rush of a scene, where you as Nate grabs onto the landing gear only a second or two before the wheel leave the ground and begins a rapid ascent, so that as the wheel disappears into the landing gear bay, Elena and her car are only a small speck in the distance.

If, as I dearly hope it does, video games become an exciting way to tell stories, the UNCHARTED games were be where it was first done successively. I have friends who claim Metal Gear Solid deserves that prize, despite 20 minute cut scenes of excruciating boredom. And while THE LAST OF US has taken story telling to an entirely new level. And thanks to Bluepoint, we can relive these first three games in all the glory of PS4.

This doesn't mean that I don't still love games like DIABLO 3, where I'm determined to get my characters to 800 paragon level. But the story there is pretty dull. And in a month I'll submerge myself into FALLOUT 4 and will probably stay there for a year or two. But I don't expect a story. But it also means that when we do get another video game narrative - which will hopefully before UNCHARTED 4 or THE LAST OF US 2 - I will hope to see a dramatic improvement in the narrative capacity of video games. And if we get it, we can look back to the UNCHARTED series with gratitude for having aspire to be more than just a video game."
3502,5,"holds my vita and 3ds to boot! its a tight fit if i try for just the vita and its charger, though you cant really fit the charger in the pouches on the inside. it should also be noted the 3ds that i fit in with the vita was a first gen and it sat comfortably on the other side of the divider right in between the thumb sticks on the vita. 3ds games can be crammed into the vita card slots but it is not a comfortable fit. i wouldn't recommend hanging this case around off a bag but having carried it inside my backpack for a year i think it is a solid amount of protection."
3503,5,Bought this a a gift for grandson - he plays this game frequently!
3504,5,Excellent game and tale!
3505,5,"The first time I tried the demo of this fun ATV racer, I knew Disney had a winner.  This is a family friendly racing game that anyone can pick up and play, and enjoy.

When you first start the game, you are subject to a trial run to make sure you know how to handle your ATV in competition.  This short tutorial teaches you all that you need to know about the game and how to complete tricks, before you jump in and start racing.

The heart of the game is in the World Tour mode.  There is also a Single Race mode, Time Trial, and Online play (there is no local multiplayer mode).  In World Tour, riders begin their career at Stage 1 and must compete in a variety of race styles (race, sprint, freestyle) to unlock points.  When you have enough points, you advance to (unlock) Stage 2, and so on, until you eventually progress through the game's 10 stages.  The good news here is that you do not have to win (or place in the top 3) in order to earn these points.  Even placing 10th will net you a couple points towards your goal.  Of course, the better you place, the more points you earn, but races are repeatable until you acquire the right number to unlock the next stage.

Right from Stage 1, you have a variety of tracks, so you are not racing repeatedly around the same terrain.  These tracks are gorgeous to look at, and a heck of a lot of fun to careen around at top speed.  As others have noted, the tricks are amazing, the air is huge, and the scenery is simply breathtaking--if you have time to admire it.  More likely, you will be looking to land your trick, or ahead to the next jump.

Your ATV is the 'main character' in the game, allowing you to build and customize it any way you like.  Winning races and unlocking stages will award you with special performance parts and items to equip, and even if you are not mechanically minded, it's a lot of fun tweaking your ATV the way you want it, be that simply a new paint job and some decals.  However, you will quickly learn the value of adding performance parts to help with your next race.  At the beginning of the game, you only have two ATV garage spots, but as you progress, more become available, so you will soon have an entire garage of ATVs at your disposal.  Some races require a certain engine qualification etc to enter, so having several ATVs of different specs is a plus.

You choose a rider for your ATV, and can change riders at any time between races.  Riders don't increase your skills as such, but each one has a unique Special Trick to add to your repertoire, so trying them all is fun.  Additional riders can also be unlocked.  One of the neat little touches I like is that your rider starts a race with clean clothes, but ends it splattered from head to toe with mud.

Overall, this is a very accessible racer for everyone who enjoys, or has even a passing interest in, the racing genre.  Good clean (or in this case, muddy!) fun."

3509,5,"I was never an arcade stick kind of guy even though i owned a few cabinets in my time. I recently bought a sega virtua stick (hss-0136) and it was good but i modded it and learned how good an Seimitsu ls-56 joystick can actually make playing games better and i bought a virtua stick pro (hss-0130) after and loooved the Seimitsu ls-32 joysticks since they were much better at shmups and in general.i heard the buttons on both were generic soldered crap buttons but i did not care.

After a while I noticed the hori vlx prem and I thought I would give it a chance....boy what an amazing arcade stick... larger than the virtua stick and smaller than the virtua stick pro.the buttons were very responsive and the joystick felt like the ls-32 and the extra r3 l3 butons were perfect for mapping coin and start or service mode etc.

My pc with windows 10 picked up the controller and knew exactly what it was.it is absolutely gorgeous in person and very heavy too.playing mame and demul and retroarch never ever felt this good.having the taito licence makes it look that much better and feels more authentic. This stick is a must buy."
3510,5,"Fast shipping, great European racer thx"
3511,5,"I was in the market for the original Picross DS or Colorcross DS after downloading the Animal Colorcross game on my dsi. Went into Gamestop, hoping they had it, but they didn't. The clerk recommended Picross 3d, so I got it. That was a month ago. I haven't stopped playing it since. I dream about it, at work I can't wait to get home to play it. I'm addicted. It is a great challenging puzzle game!

I love the collections. Every shape you unveil is added to your ""collections"" which are themed backgrounds that hold 5 or more of your shapes of the same theme. Once all the shapes to a particular theme are collected, you earn a little gold medal on that collection. It's nothing big, but I think it's cute, and it pushes me to work at unveiling the shapes within the time limit, and with no strikes, so I can unlock the bonus puzzles and earn all the shapes I can.

The replay value is high. The price is good. The game is awesome!"
3512,5,Beautiful looking headset and sounds awesome!
3513,5,"I play a lot of PC games having put together an expensive rig with 3D surround on 3 monitors.

Let me tell you, BF3 is the best game I've played so far on triple wide. Although there are some minor annoyances such as allied and enemy markers not displaying at 5760x1080, the rest of the game is absolutely breathtaking in triple wide, even more so than Crysis 2 or even Skyrim.

BF3 offers more cooperative gameplay than MW3. As a result, there is less fast-paced mindless head blowing than in MW3, so people who only spend 30-45 minutes at a time in front of their TV's on their bro-box360 may not like BF3's objective based style. If you on the other hand are a PC-FPS gamer, then BF3's deeper gameplay offers you tons more reward for simply executing strategies than mindlessly blowing the 6000th guy's head off."
3514,5,BEEN PLAYING SKYRIM ON PS-3 BUT THE PS-4
3515,5,"This game rocks! Just like the arkham city and arkham asylum, this game does not disappoint!! Story is great, action is great. Love it."
3516,5,"Great keyboard, even ordered a second one for another desktop. I am not a gamer and these keyboards were bought so I could see what I was typing without having loads of light or night time working so for me the keyboard is comfortable, the keys have a good touch and I like the choice of the 3 colors of light, (blue-default, red, and purple, the red and purple are actually a little brighter). all in all a good keyboard and the one I have had for well over a year without issue and the keyboard is used daily for several hours per day/night."
3517,5,"Everyone I know who has bought one of these is convinced the Wii Fit Plus is possessed by the devil and truly evil.  It taunts you, belittles you, and makes sarcastic sounds when you get on the board.  Comical, but hey, it works in motivating you to exercise.  I've lost 12 pounds and gotten much more fit in the six weeks I've had it.  I swear it wakes up in the middle of the night and speaks softly to you...just kidding.  The darned thing works."
3518,5,This mouse is awesome.  I absolutely love the pinky rest.  I use the matte black raised palm rest and matte thumb rest.  I also use all the weights.  This thing has worked for me for the past 2 years and also makes my desk look really neat.

3520,5,"The most important thing before buying a VR headset is to manage your expectations. I was someone who expected this to be kind of cool but ultimately feel like a gimmick. I bought Playstation move at launch and was pretty disappointed in the long run. I had the same expectation with the Playstaion VR. I thought it would be kind of cool but ultimately a gimmick. I'm proud to say after spending hours in VR that I am all in. The content currently out is small and short but I feel that short spurts of gaming in VR is the best. Some of my favorite games right now are Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, Batman Arkham VR, and Job Simulator. If your expecting full fledged experiences I would wait till Resident Evil 7 comes out or try the headset at a friends house or store before buying. If your looking for a new experience in game play and have the funds I think this is completely worth it."
3521,5,"Game is a lot of fun.  Some of the new skills to learn took a bit to learn, but overall was simple enough to understand.  In some ways yes it did feel like a reskinned Civilization 5, but it still has me coming back for more, the old just one more click and then about 20 clicks later you are ok now I'm shutting it down.  If you like previous civilizations then chance is you will like this one as well."
3522,5,"Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed this keyboard. Not only does the sounds the keyboard makes when you type sound oh-so much better, but my overall performance when I came to words per minute has improved aswell. The keyboard took some getting use to for me. I found some buttons to squeek. I reached out to the Thermaltake Facebook page and they answered a lot of my questions I had on the spot. Fast service aswell! This keyboard is still performing well in all areas, whether it'd be gaming or general typing use. Again, I really Like this as it's a semi-affordable gaming keyboard anyone can enjoy."
3523,5,"I just finished Bioshock and what can I say Bravo!  2K did a beautiful job of pulling together a wonderfully atmospheric game.  There are quibbles such as the ""Hacking"" puzzle redundancy, but the advantage is that at least you know whats coming at you so it's actually  an advantage.  The gene upgrades could show a bit more diversity and innovation, but they work. While the plot isn't overly deep,there are a few nice twists. Yes as ""Zero Punctuation"" puts it it's like system shock meets Ayn Rand- but I think in a great way.  As far as game play, There is  there no strategic element, though tactics are required when fighting.

  Importantly, this is a game that ""Gets"" that there are a growing number of gamers out there in their thirties, forties and on up who aren't looking for twitch gaming with impossible boss fights that require an exact 728 button sequence done at the speed of a nervous Chihuahua in a crack seizure to over come.

  If you'd like a great game with wonderful atmosphere- head on over to Rapture."

3527,5,"These are beautiful works of art. The limited edition Halo 5 controllers come in both Guardians and Spartan colors. Not being partial to green, the grey/chrome blue look of the Guardians controller drew me in.

I already have a Titanfall controller, and the Guardians one is the next to fill in my player two.

Compared to a regular controller, the limited edition is dimensionally pretty much exactly the same. The handling is no different, the sticks and buttons all operate the same when I'm playing games, so there is nothing to 'adapt' to. The finish is great, and covered in a thin layer of satin to prevent undue wear over time of the outer design.
There are two strange glossy rectangles on the bottom of the unit on the handle grips, not sure what they're for. Potentially for setting down the controller?

Considering the current cost of XBox One controllers right now, you may as well just splurge a little to pick up one of these 'limited' controllers, they attract a LOT of attention and just look amazing."
3528,5,"But I am more than willing to hand down 5+ stars to Okami (as many reviewers have before me).

Where to begin? Without sounding repetitive and touching on too many of the popular points, Okami is simply a piece of art. The entire concept, especially your celestial brush drawing ability, is ingenious, and the graphics are soothing and incredibly beautiful. I really can't say enough about how much I love the colors, scenery, and design.

I do have to point out, however, that Okami is generally a straight-forward walk in the park. In my first 30 hours of gameplay, I really was only ""stuck"" twice. More often than not, Issun, your Poncle guide, will indicate in highlighted red letters what you probably should be doing; otherwise, the camera will zoom in and out in a brief cutscene, indicating exactly what needs to be done in a given puzzle room.

However, I can't really say that this is a downfall. Okami is actually so -fun- that it doesn't need to be difficult: the player will enjoy themselves enough with the graphics, design, characters, sidequests, and battle sequences. You won't need to be challenged to love this game. That said, though, if you're shopping around for an artsier Ninja Gaiden, this isn't the game for you.

I have only two complaints for this game. First, the camera seems to get stuck every once in awhile in this version of the game (I can't speak for the Wii). By ""stuck,"" I mean it zooms in close enough to be an FPS and then can't zoom out--or I'll get stuck in a corner and won't be able to tell which way is up. This is really unfortunate, since the rest of the gameplay is all so smooth. Second, I take issue with the fact that some of the most fun brush techniques (and the double-jump) come so late in the game. For example, at one point in the game you can attain a holy artifact called the Water Tablet, which allows you to run across the surface of water on lilypads - so cool/so much fun! However, you don't attain this until 3/4 of the way through the game, and at that point it is practically useless unless you backtrack to the first town and re-adventure across the map once more. I can handle that, but I really would have liked to have techniques like this earlier in the game to get more enjoyment out of them.

That said, I still give Okami 5+ stars. The handling is 99.9% smooth, the characters are fun, the graphics are breath-taking, and the story is loaded. You will not regret this purchase!"
3529,5,"New arrived in a hurry, great price... And enjoy playing it ...."
3530,5,Best game ever! Except maybe for bloodborne
3531,5,good
3532,5,"wow,disk was in good shape, played this on ps2 5 yrs ago and forgot how good this game was and they need a part 2 or even a movie based on this. Thanks for the game."
3533,5,"[UPDATE 10/6/2008 - I have one big gripe about this game... there is only ONE difficulty available for the wii version!  For the xbox/ps3 versions, once you beat the game on easy, harder difficulties are unlocked.  Not so on the wii version!  this is very disappointing!  Now, I hesitate to pick up the game again other than for the versus mode!  I still stand by my review... it is a great game!  But additional difficulty options would have really increased this game's replay value!  Bummer...]

Before I say anything, let me state that I have played this game on Wii as well as PS3, and I saw the game played on XBOX 360.  The graphics presented on the PS3 version were simply stunning.  Hands down, one of the coolest titles I have seen on PS3 so far, for sure.  That being said, the reason I own a wii is that the controls are innovative and add a new dimension to game play.... this is where SWFU on wii comes in.  Playing this game with the wii's controls is amazing.  Granted, the graphics on the wii console are not on par with other next-gen consoles, so don't expect it to keep up in this arena...but despite that fact, this games graphics are surprisingly well done, and the physics engine is strong as well.  There are stormtroopers and wookies rag-dolling all over the place!  Several reviewers bashed the games graphics, but I was genuinely pleased.  The graphics are, to be honest, on par with a REALLY good PS2 game. I get the impression that, rather than focusing on pushing the system to it's graphical limits, they focused on the overall gameplay experience.  The controls are SO WELL DONE!  I really can't imagine playing through this game with a xbox or ps3 controller... it would be a waste of time and BORING.  If I wanted HD graphics, I would watch the movies!  Using the wii's controls, you really feel like you are in the game.  I know that sounds kinda lame... but the controls make all the difference with this title.  The feeling you get when using the wiimote as your lightsaber and the nunchuck for your force powers/movement... it just works. period.  You are able to chain together some really devastating lightsaber/force attacks, and it just feels natural... grabbing a felucian with the nunchuck, throwing your lightsaber at him with a flick of the wiimote, and then with a downward swing of the nunckuck, slamming him to the ground... it just feels so right.[smile]  Also, I love that the speaker on the wiimote emits that awesome lightsaber sound whenever you swing it.  Nice touch for sure.

Some people complained about the camera, but I got used to it quickly, and it worked well.  I would say that this is easily the best star wars game to date.  Lastly, let me mention that the versus mode is really well done.  My only gripe is that there is no CPU player, so this mode is really only available when you have a second human player available.  Me and a friend had a chance to play through it for a few hours yesterday, and we had way more fun than 2 grown men should be able to have playing a video game!  My wife walked in to find me devastating him with a sith lightning attack, only to choke him to death and win the match... needless to say she was not impressed with my darkside prowess [lol].

So, please, do yourself a favor.  If you own a wii, buy this game!  You will not regret it."

3537,5,"I would have liked to give it a 4.5 review for the amount of shovel ware and lack of games that were released on the system. Say what you want about Nintendo they always find a way to innovate and this system was a massive blockbuster at the time. There were some really great titles on this system like Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2, Donkey Kong Country returns, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, to games to appeal to the masses Wii Sports & Wii fit to underrated gems that deserve more praise and admiration like Sin & Punishment and Mad World (my personal favourite on the system). Also these were built to last I bought a PS3 in 2009 it conked out in me in 2013 I had to get a new one, I brought my Wii in 2007 and it still works!"

It's a very light headset, and they do feel great, even though it's all made of plastic.

The cord is really long, which I sometimes like as I can walk around the room while chatting to people, however, for the most part it gets to be too long, so a lot of it will remain on the floor, and it will get dirty. Other than that, great product."
3542,5,The wonder world amusement park is so much fun my entire family loves this game.  It like have a family game night on the Wii.
3543,5,These are a fun way to spend a winter afternoon.  I'd recommend them to anyone who doesn't want a huge challenge.
3544,5,It's virtual funds. Not much to it other than they lasted about 5 minutes in-game.

3546,5,Does the job.
3547,5,"I was hesitating to buy nier after reading the reviews. However, after beating ff xiii, I wanted to give it a try. Yes, the graphics are bad, like ps2. But the game is so much fun that it doesn't matter! It reminds me the old Amiga days.
Seriously I didn't have so much fun with a game in long long time. I definitely recommend this game."
3548,5,"I'm an old school gamer, not that old school haha but this is a really fun fist person shooter. This game should've had co-op mode. It arrived in excellent condition thank you!!"

3552,5,a  gift
3553,5,Great Fishing Rod. Makes the game way more fun. I had it for a long time now and its the best.
3554,5,"With Tales of Xillia 2 as the sequel to tales of Xillia, it is expected that some environments will be used again but the familiar faces and the entire ensemble meeting again is well worth it. The combat system is improved further with the introduction of a few new game mechanics but they stay true to the combat system of the Tales series and deliver a great story. There is also the introduction of the choices mechanic where you can choose how to play out your game, this leads to you being able to build relationships with your fellow friends and even choose between 3 different endings like how JRPGS have always been although the game does have its downsides such as being able to only choose 4 party members when venturing out into the wild, it is still a great game worth having if you are considering whether to pick up this wonderful Tales game."
3555,5,"Nintendo did it again, this game is just so much fun... no story, no streamlines, no boundaries but so much creativity, must have for any wii u owner."
3556,5,the vehicle assortment is a great addition to the Skylanders universe. be aware that these only work with the superchargers game and line of characters but they do work the same across all platforms except for the 3DS game which is strictly a racing game.
3557,5,"If you like Match 3 games, you'll probably love this. The gameplay itself is fun, and the music and backgrounds are stunning. The game looks great in HD. Totally worth buying."
3558,5,Great underwater vehicle
3559,5,nice sticks make the grips thicker like the 360
3560,5,"I swear, I think ALL the Sly games are awesome as hell, and I was incredibly stoked when this one came out. I think it's such a great game. It's easy enough for those not so great at gaming to be able to complete (maybe with some help, haha), but it's challenging enough for those intermediates. There's many details, there's a story-line, action, and lovable characters. This game is just plain awesome, so great."
3561,5,"While you read this review you are missing out on valuable time you could be playing this game.  This game by the makers of The Sims is on par with fun.  You make a golf course then you can change the holes, or even play your own golf tournament.  That is right; you can play your own golf course as you could with Roller Coaster.  It is like 2 games in one.  This game also has many different possible courses so replay is endless.  You also don't need to look for those codes to get more money; there is a mode where you can play with infinite money where you try to get your fun and skill rating up.  You can even sell homes to Movie and Music Stars on your golf course.  I knew that the programmers at EA were having a lot of fun creating this game when a ""Britney Agulara"" bought one of my lakeside homes.  I also enjoyed playing a 9 hole tournament against a ""Fuzzy Navel"".  I am not joking if you play this game, you will come across many funny names including the ones I have mentioned here.  This game is a lot of fun!"
3562,5,great

This game is awesome and i would reccomend it everyone and to all Zelda fans who haven't gotten this awesome game yet. 10/10 and 5 stars!!"
3566,5,"The game arrived within the specified range and with no defects.  I've played the game before at a friend's place, and I can say, without a doubt, that this is the best Nintendo fighting game yet.  Not only does it incorporate the classic game-play from its previous titles, but it now has an interesting adventure mode to boot.  This a definite ""must have"" for any Nintendo enthusiast."
3567,5,Another childhood game that I had to buy again. I loved this game growing up and I'm glad I bought it again The product came fast and free of damage. It was brand new.
3568,5,"A good gaming mouse is often the edge you need to be successful when playing multiplayer games with others. Typically I have seen gaming mice that are wired and have a lot of buttons that can be programmed for various functions such as auxiliary fire and the like. This mouse is different than the typical gaming mouse I have used, in that it has only six buttons and is wireless. There are other features to this mouse that I really appreciate as well.

Though this is marketed as a gaming mouse, I find it to be perfectly suitable as a business and general purpose mouse. The main buttons work exactly as expected - left-click, right-click and the scroll wheel button all are normal-function buttons. The two buttons on the left of the mouse work as navigation buttons that allow for web navigation in a browser, forwards and backwards. The silver button on the top is a DPI switch button and it allows you to change the resolution which is great if you are working in an application that requires more precision.

This is a rechargeable mouse and on the front of the mouse between the buttons is the USB port for charging.

I like the fact that there are a couple of different settings for the mouse. When using for serious gaming it can be set to glow and change colors. It also can be set to not glow at all and it does not affect the operation at all. After 5 minutes, regardless of which setting you choose, it cuts itself off and can be awakened by a button click. Since charging it completely it has been on continuously for weeks (and sleeping between uses)  and I still have not needed to charge it again.

What I like most of all about this mouse is that it is quiet. When I clock, it makes so little sound that it is possible to work away in the night and not make any appreciable noise. The cooling pad I use with my laptop actually makes more noise than this mouse.

When I plugged in the receiver under Windows it worked straight away and I did not need to do anything special. It was very much plug-and-play. I tried the same with Linux and again it worked without argument - I plugged in the receiver and the mouse simply worked.

This is a slightly large mouse and ergonomically it fits my hand very well. I have not had any cramping problems with this mouse which is a problem I have had with smaller mice. This mouse is comfortable enough that I use it full-time now.

This is a very nice mouse. It is designed for gaming but it works great as a workstation mouse too. If you are looking for a good mouse that will work either as a gamers mouse or as a workstation mouse under heavy use, this is a very affordable solution that for me has worked out well.

3569,5,"2K wishes it was like MVP. This game remains a classic and for me one of the best baseball games ever behind MLB The Show. I played with the Rockies and had a fun time playing with them. I also played with the Diamondbacks winning the World Series over Oakland in 7 games. This game is realistic, great graphics and easy gameplay."
3570,5,I love the game can't wait to play it thanks Amazon
3571,5,"Four amazing campaigns
Amazing, fun multiplayer

Seriously, what more can you ask for? Yeah it had a rough launch, but the game runs flawless for me now. Whoever says it's broken is lying out their ass."
3572,5,Game was delivered on time and I was completely satisfied with the way you all handled everything thanks for everything
3573,5,"This is one of the best games ever for PS3.  The graphics are great and make you feel like a real superhero.  You can scale tall buildings, leap between rooftops and jump from dizzying heights, all of which add to the feel of having superpowers.  While this is a standard third person shooter at heart, the game's use of lightning-based powers eliminates the need to pick up and manage weapons and ammo, keeping things flowing.  If you run low on power, all you have to do is drain a nearby generator.  There is a wide variety of tasks and side-quests, and you are generally free to roam as you wish.  You can adjust the difficulty level, and there is more than enough challenge to be found here even for seasoned players, as you will often find yourself in the middle of hordes of enemies with serious firepower (which can hurt you; you may be a superhero but you are far from invincible).  The superpowers themselves (which you can upgrade as you earn experience points) are wide ranging and a lot of fun to pull off, especially later on in the game when you can literally take down armored vehicles with a single shot.  Of course, you have the option of pursuing the path of a ""good superhero"" or ""infamous villain"" and your choices will affect the game-play and story somewhat.  The story is good and the comic-book style presentation fits the feel of the game.  Overall, a very well-designed and original game that I highly recommend for just about anyone."
3574,5,This game absolutely nailed the James Bond experience. This is a fun and exciting Bond title that has some truly engaging situations and pretty production values. Certainly worth considering if you are a Bond fan or just want a good shooter.
3575,5,can not get enough of this game
3576,5,"Soul Calibur 2 is the best fighting game ever in this reviewer's opinion. Great graphics, interesting characters, awesome gameplay. It doesn't get any better than this. The weapons-focused combat is also an absolute plus for me.
Pros:
-Some of the best graphics out there.
-Sound is unparralelled. Necrid especially can realy rumble the subwoofers if you have any decent surround sound setup.
-Controls are easy enough that new players and button-mashers can latch on instatly, while still offering tons of depth for experienced players.
-Tons of unlockables reward you for playing the singleplayer mode, which is fun and worthwhile in itself. Yes, you ""buy"" most every unlockable in the game- but trust me, the system works.
-Lots of stages and unlockable costumes/items/stages/etc make multiplayer an absolute blast.
-XBox gets a unique custom character, Todd McFarlane's spawn. With an axe, fireballs, and levitation moves, spawn brings a new twist to Soul Calibur (while remaining a surprisingly balanced characer)
-Everything has a counter. The game featues tons of options for sidestepping or blocking or counter-attacking. There is no ""one attack"" that can win a game. But, every character does have a core set of good moves- meaning everything is balanced and both offensive and defensive tactics are perfectly valid in this game.
Cons:
-The controls are a little too forgiving for beginners. Some players wind up claiming you can get through the whole game just mashing buttons. And you can, but see my note at the end.
-Only one ""unique"" character per system. XBox got Spawn, and Spawn rules, but if you want Link or Heihachi you'll have to check out another version.
-Fans of hand-to-hand combat and ""Tag"" style multiplayer need not apply. Soul Calibur has tons of modes, just not these modes.
Note on button-mashing: Although you can certainly do fairly well, I can personally attest to the fact that someone who masters the controls really has an authorative edge. When my button-mashing fiancee (who could beat quite a few of her friends) told me I wasn't allowed to take it easy on her, I beat her something like 20-0, and did it ""playing fair"" and choosing random characters. So yes, button-mashers can fair well but they can't hold a candle to someone who bothers to really learn the control system.
If you're looking for ""that one fighting game"" you can play, this is it. The graphics, the gameplay... it's just good. Did I mention there's a decent story line behind it all? SC2 is worth what you pay and tons more- I can't reccomend it enough."
3577,5,Item exactly as described
3578,5,Like old playstation games and this is one of my favorite series.  I would recommend to anyone who likes the Twisted metal series.
3579,5,Wonderful Price!  Would by from again!
3580,5,I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +
3581,5,"This game is amazing to say the least, however While going through this game i'm starting to see that the DVD disc hit it's limit with this title because there could of been so much more added to the game if they had say a HD-dvd disc.

I just wish xbox 360 used HD-dvd discs.
If we got this big of a game with a 9 gigabyte DVD disc, imagine what could of been done with a HD-dvd disc.

[They have to use alot of repeat geometry and all the free explore planets really do just look the same with different hills.(kind of bland)]

However, Mass effect is the best game the xbox 360 will probably ever have in terms of size and graphics, that being said the game is also limited by the 9 gigabyte dvd disc and that will limit future titles; we truly have seen the next-gen with this title,

The only way we will get a better game than mass effect is if developers use HD-dvd discs.

Anyhow:

I give mass effect:

10/10 graphics
10/10 sound
10/10 story, characters
9/10 combat

I really do love the size of this game, the graphics are great, and the characters awesome, I just wish xbox 360 used HD-dvd discs.
If we got this big of a game with a 9 gigabyte DVD disc, imagine what could of been done with a HD-dvd disc."
3582,5,sweet game
3583,5,"this game is awsome very unique fighting skills great story great charcters better than the first shin budokai game wow and the first was hot to great like this one but this is better with more awsome characters like future gohan, bardok, SS4 goku, super buu, majin buu, meta cooler, and more great charcters. Great game but the story mode is just a little hard at some points but this game is fun can't wait until dragonballz burst limit comes out for the xbox360 that game looks cool and fun to but this game is great very fun."
3584,5,Awesome Game Greet Story Mode and Rooster The game Was brand new when i Oder it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! played season more 5 times
3585,5,The kids will be so excited when they get this for Christmas!!!cant beat the value.
3586,5,will play after i beat origins. Started playing dragon age at inquisition so i bought this for after i beat origins because i want to experience the stories before DA inquisition.
3587,5,I have not beat this game yet but it's a beautiful game that's all I can say for now
3588,5,The game it's self is great just a pain to install. Word of caution if you buy this game used you will also need to buy it on Steam as well just to install it.
3589,5,"Where do I begin in describing this game. Great, this game is one of the best Survival Horrors since ""Resident Evil 2"". Having just played the god awfull ""Evil Dead: Hail to the King"" I needed a game that would restore my faith in the Survival Horror genre. Low and behold my hopes are brought up wiith ""Onimusha: WarLords"".  Combining the elements that made the Resident Evil series so great Onimusha bring Playstation 2 owners a true feast for the eyes. Demonstration the true power of the system the graphics are some of the best ever!  tHOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR DIFFRENT GAME PLAY AND ORGINALITY LEAVE NOW THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU! Seriously there is nothing new to the game play which steals from ""Resident Evil"", ""Soul Reaver"" and ""Tenchu"".  The game is however an awsome game if you want to have fun and become sucked into a story line with characters you can actually like. For anyone whom has seen ""Ninja Scroll"" this game is a lot like that movie. This game contains extreme scenes of graphic violence, gore, language, and some just plain down disturbing scenes! Not a game for the young crowd. Onimusha: Warlords is the game we Playstation 2 owners have been waiting for. It was well worth the wait!"
3590,5,Wonderful!  Amazon does an excellent job shipping electronics.
3591,5,EXCELENTE
3592,5,I mainly got this to match unleashed ll. Just what I needed.
3593,5,"Crash has been a series that has been hated unjustly for many years. From Wrath of Cortex to Crash Tag Team Racing, the games were hated for being too similar. But now, they're detested by fans for being too different. I don't understand it. This game is, in my opinion, the best Crash game when it comes to gameplay, ever.

You can fight with a combat moveset instead of a simple 1-hit kill move that froze the enemy's animation and sent them flying away in an odd fashion. You can now use Aku Aku to take over large mutant enemies called Titans which have their own unique moves and powers (For example, the Titan Spike has the ability to raise spikes from the ground to damage enemies as his special attack) and if your Titan dies, you can just jack (that's the in-game term. Short for hijack) another Titan to fight with, or use one you store in your pocket, which is one of the new abilities to the series: You can stun a Titan, store him in your pocket and use him to fight when you want or need to. But Crash isn't defenseless either. He has a light and Heavy combo, a block and now the ability to dodge attacks by pressing triangle at the right time (when the prompt shows itself at the bottom right or left (for the second player in co-op mode) of the screen) to dodge an attack and press it a second time to do a counter attack. According to the manual, this is Crash's strongest move. There are also collectibles called Golden Wumpa Fruit that are well-hidden which extend your life bar. Almost triple of you get all of them. They're very useful and fun to find. They also appeared as lives in the previous game, Crash of the Titans. Speaking of Crash of the Titans, this game does 1 thing Titans which, despite being also great, failed at. This game has around 50/50 platforming and combat which makes the game much less monotonous while Titans, despite being fun, gets repetitive after a while. But don't be warded off, Titans is still a great game. Both have advantages over the other, in which Titans has a better story and more polish than Mind Over Mutant. But it's up to the reader's tastes.

The game isn't perfect however. The amount of moves for Crash and the Titans individually is something you'd expect being state of the art in 2003 and the plot is full to bursting with jokes that distract from the story itself to the point you probably wouldn't care about the story. But Crash was never a very serious franchise, so it's not very out of place, just overdone. They also made cartoon cutscenes which parody other animation styles such as 1950s horror movies, Dragon Ball Z and South Park. I personally find these cutscenes embarrassing and annoying, but a good amount of people like them, so you'd really have to see the cutscenes yourself. More than one to understand, because they have around 7 different animation styles. Unfortunately, this means there are very few (about 2 only) in-game 3-D animation cutscenes. The cutscenes are gorgeous and the designs of the characters are very interesting and... Well, there's many ways to say it: Modern, fresh, new, cool, stylish. But it's very sad they couldn't put more CGI cutscenes. But I believe the deadline they were given was to blame, not so much the developers themselves (how much can you put into a game with only around 11 months time?).

The graphics for the PS2 are absolutely stunning. The only differences are no reflection in the water and other minor graphical leave-outs. But the rest is very well stylized, very detailed for the PS2 and just good eye-candy. The music is great in my opinion, fitting Crash's style. I'll admit, it's not as great as TwinSanity or the PS1 platforming Crash games when it comes to music, but it's still great.

Overall, this game is still amazing and fun. The biggest and only notable problems are the cartoon cutscenes and how short it is. Only about 6 hours. But if you like getting 100%, this game will run you about 8 and a half hours. It has complex gameplay (compared to older Crash titles), great music, graphics and enemies to control which really add flavor to the game, and a passable story that is easily ignorable, making it fun for kids (but then again, it should be. Crash has always been aimed towards kids). But if you do like comedy, this game could make you laugh at times. But in my opinion, Crash of the Titans' jokes had more thought and polish on them. All-in-all, I think it's the best Crash game yet and a great blueprint on how to improve and modernize the series' gameplay in the future. Great job Radical."
3594,5,It's all working good here and was a good deal. came here just in time and nothing was missing. trusted salesman right here doods.
3595,5,"Best gaming mouse ever, don't argue with me about it, you are WRONG no matter what. I purchased a razer ouroboros mouse and i cant even feel comfortable after using deathadder."
3596,5,Fun but different. I love the Kingdom Hearts games and have played several this is my 1st DS one. Its very DS game right now with how you care for the Spirits being similar to how you care for Pokmon in Pokmon Sun & Moon. Im not fond of the whole time limit thing and then you switch from Riku to Sora (& vice versa) and from level to level.
3597,5,"Gonna make it short and sweet. Graphics are amazing. From the stages to the characters. The Fatalities go to 30fps to make them more cinematic and the camera angles make it better. And the best part to me is the characters. 25 years are the last MK. The old school fighters have aged! NO OTHER FIGHTING GAME HAS DONE THIS YET (Street Fighter cough cough)!!! And the new comers are are awesome. This is a must have for fighters. Net code will be worked on in due time. Anyone with common sense would know that when a game is released its gonna have a bug or two. And how about the VERY informative training mode. Next gen fighters better step their game up because MKX has set the bar. Must have......

Yea, I know.... This wasn't very short lol!!
#MustBuy"
3598,5,Great Collector's ITEM
3599,5,"I got a copy of R6V2 last night and I have to say that I really welcome the only 4 new additions they implemented on this game in which are (character customation, Sprint - like COD4, co-op mission gameplay online, and online/offline rank up system.

I am a huge fan of Rainbow Six series and by far, I like this game a lot more than the first Vegas. Eventhough a lot of you might feel the game is basically just an expansion, for that reason alone is why I like it a lot better than the first. Being able to sprint was something I always wanted in a Rainbow six game, co-op mission gameplay with a buddy online is also something I really welcomed in this game, the ranking system in which is not limited to just online play is simply an incentive for playing this game. And last, but not least, I was able to use my 360 web cam to take a shot of my face and place it on the character................. yes, I know you were able to do this on the first Vegas,,,, but now it doesnt just limits for this to be just online, you can have an image of yourself on the character during the campaing as well.
To summarize, some of you might have expected a lot more, but as a Rainbow Six fan, I have to say that even if it did not change much from the previous one, the new additions fit well on the game, the graphics are a bit more polished and the game itself kicks arse. And to top it off, it runs as smooth as the first, if not better.
Stop complaining and go get this game. I tripple dare you.."
3600,5,"Been using this keyboard ever since I got my new PC. As a matter of fact, I am using it right now to type this review. Never heard of the brand before, but loved it so much I bought one for my sister. It looks like a true gaming pc and comes with a very nice mouse as well. For the price you can't beat that. Recommend it guys!!!"
3601,5,It was a gift for a niece and she was very happy with it. She wanted a Barbie game for the Wii and for her age and what was offered with Barbie this was the perfect fit.
3602,5,Loved
3603,5,Masterpiece game
3604,5,"This game is great, what else do you expect from Blizzard? With combining both ""Reign of Chaos"" and ""Frozen Throne"", its a winning combination. ""Reign of Chaos"" is a great game that takes you through 4 campaigns with 4 races, the new Undead and Night Elf races are nice introductions to spice up the game and evolve it from the times of Warcraft II. Much has changed here, this game has a little medieval touch to it which I really like, pretty easy to understand what an axe is, unlike in Starcraft(the sci-fi weapons). They made this game well because there is no ""easy"" difficulty setting, only ""normal"" and ""hard"", so you'll like trying to win the levels and put a little more effort in(unless your a ... and have to use cheat codes to spoil the game). And the campaign is definetly NOT easy, only the human campaign is truly easy. Once you get to the Night Elf campaign, well good luck, you'll need it(especially on the last level). Sure, certain missions are easy, but thats what the expansion pack, ""The Frozen Throne"" makes up for. First, I'd like to say the the campaigns on TFT are EXTREMELY HARD. You start off with the Night Elf campaign, and the first mission isn't too difficult, but if you compare RoC's(Reign of Chaos) with this one, you'll see that the bar of difficulty has been raised. Next, you go to the Alliance Campaign, which pretty much entirely revolves around the Blood Elves, which is a new, non-playable in custom games, race. You also get to use the Naga forces again as you did in one Night Elf mission. You then move onto the final, and hardest, campaign, The Scourge. Yes, the undead are still here, and DAMN is this campaign hard. Every mission requires skill, patience, and raw brutality to win. Anyone who says this campaign is easy, must be the best gamer of all time. These missions are hard, and are very long. This will keep you mesmorized in the game. There is also a Bonus campaign!! Just when I thought things couldn't get any better. This campaign is looonnnggg(if you have all 3 Acts downloaded, you can get them by simply logging onto battle.net on your account), Rexxar, a beastmaster, goes through many many levels of obstacles. This Bonus campaign makes up for the lack of an Orc campaign in TFT. This campaign is a story, and never cuts off, just revolves around Rexxar, its absolutely awesome! 4 new heros(1 for each race, and even more that you can hire!) add even more to the excitement. You should really get a battle.net account(and this is great, its totally free) so you can automatically download new patches to make your game better! I really love battle.net, no paying 20 bucks a month to play with millions of other people online, no 3 months free then pay, none of that! Its just a free gamer universe for Blizzard games. This feature here will guarantee that even when you finish the campaigns, battle.net will bring you YEARS of enjoyment to the game. Another thing to add in, this game was named ""Game of the Year"" by Gamespot, and its so true. I don't see how you could not like this game, aside from little complaints that really don't give a serious down to the game, you'll love this! This game is definetly worth your money, and putting the expansion with the original in the same box, is an even greater plus! Buy this game, its worth every penny, you will NOT be dissappointed."
3605,5,THIS IS A GREAT FIRST PERSON SHOOTER GAME. YOU ARE PUT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND SENARIOS IT'S  ON OF THE BEST TOM CLANCY  HAD MADE.
3606,5,"First of all, be aware that this game was released on August 14th 2003.  Therefore, all reviews prior to that date are from people who haven't actually played it and are usually fanboys who unconditionally love/hate this product.
Having played this year's iteration of Madden 2004, I can say that it is worth the money, even if you have 2003.  The addition of the owner mode is really nice and adds a lot of depth.  The overall interface has been tweaked and is really user friendly now, and the loading times/saving times are lightning fast on Xbox.  The only thing I don't like about the presentation aspect is the choice of music.  As with 2003, various upcoming rap/rock artists provide the soundtrack during the menu/management end of the game.  This is a personal taste thing, to be sure, but I find this year's selection to be really annoying.
Now the gameplay itself.  The first thing I noticed was that it's harder (as always you can adjust difficulty and AI with sliders, so it can be tweaked).  The running game is more realistic, and the pass rush is ferocious, making passing much more realistic (ie: practice!).  The new tackling animations are nice, and feel right.  I've noticed also that the computer will, on average, perform better than you, even with an inferior-rated player.  In other words, the PC will break tackles with a no-name back, while you struggle to get Marshall Faulk or Tiki Barber back to the line of scrimmage on a toss play.  The secondary AI is better, although even the best user-controlled players will still get burned and inexplicably miss tackles at times.  Pass rushing is harder, meaning sack numbers are more accurate as well.
Overall, this is a great game.  The graphics are better than either PS2 or GC, although the PS2 has the online multiplay option.  Personally I've never cared for online sports action (too many cheaters and disconnects), so it doesn't bother me that it's not included."
3607,5,"Same goes for Tekken 2: played but never owned. Now that I'm officially the best Tekken player period, the urge to own all of them, even the first 2, just consumed me...."
3608,5,"Ok first the game - This game is BRUTALLY hard even on normal, the game has random start locations and random missions which help reputability. The game also has excellent AI so where the enemies are, the numbers and types of them may not be the same if you reload the mission so be warned, the enemy will also move to flank you in numbers; the good thing is that you will only be attacked my enemies that have detected you so that helps some. This game so far (only 10 hours in) is everything we should expect from XCOM with some new options (such as carrying dead team members out) to being able to pick your pick up zone (on some missions) and adding twists to previous encountered enemies (such as the thin man). An excellent game and worthy of the XCOM name.
  As for Amazon customer service and delivery - I was pleasantly surprised- amazon used their own delivery service - which after reading the numerous negative reviews terrified me of even trying them to the point I contacted amazon support (via chat) to ask for someone reliable like Fedex - I was surprised the  item arrived on time and in excellent condition"
3609,5,Thanks
3610,5,I'm a die hard God of war fan so I'm most likely bias. but its graphics upgrade is awesome. now I'm just waiting for Sony to announce GOW4
3611,5,"First one came cracked from the factory, outside box was fine but inner plastic packaging was damaged. Amazon promptly shipped a replacement on 2 day and 2nd one works great.  Keyboard has enough customization options to keep you busy for weeks if you so desire. Love this thing! Check out razer chroma apps for custom lighting options for games/music sync etc."
3612,5,still playing it but I can't realy stop it to much fun
3613,5,dude its dam fallout need i say more
3614,5,Product works as expected. Worked for 3.0 and possibly other versions. And this is now getting hard to find but was a good buy
3615,5,Greate price fast shipping
3616,5,great game!
3617,5,"Negative reviewers didn't give this game half a chance(if they even played it at all). Now I admit...it has its faults, but what game doesn't? This game has blazing speeds, fantastic graphics, stunning landscapes and tons of eye candy. I never-ever feel like I'm on ice or a banana peel, as another reviewer said(I don't know what game he's playing?). Also, the UFO's, planes flying around, etc. make the game interesting and extremely entertaining, not sure what's wrong with that. In the COCKPIT view you can look all around with the right joystick. It's a little jerky, but neat. In ""FREE RIDE"" mode I like to stop on a mountain and watch all the activity for a while. There is much to enjoy about this game and I think it deserves a fair shake.
It has it's occasional slow-down/frame-rate issues(many racers do) and the menu page is a little goofy(but can be figured out if you know how to read). That's all I can find wrong with this game. The BENEFITS outweigh the negatives a hundred times over. Over 100 track variations(some over 10 minutes for just one lap), 7 HUGE locations(go anywhere you want, because there's no 'time limit' or 'check points' to worry about and there's also a ""FREE RIDE"" mode) and over 100 variations of Mercedes-Benz cars. If you like to go blazing fast, want an interesting racing game and want a game that has more VALUE than several racing games combined then ""WORLD RACING"" is a must!"
3618,5,Kids were thrilled!

3620,5,very good
3621,5,Excellent Product
3622,5,"I've played some of the other Professor Layton games and was very excited about getting the first title, Curious Village.  I was not disappointed.  The first Professor Layton has the charm, the intracy, and the quality puzzles that I found with the other titles.  The graphics are clear and detailed, I found I very much liked the quaint little village of St. Mystere.  Stopping and solving puzzles as you walk through the story made for hours of entertainment.  My favorite puzzles in this game were a series of Princess in a Box' sliding box puzzles, which progressed from easy to very challenging over the course of the game.  I also liked the 'Rooms at the Inn' minigame, collecting furniture and decorations for the Professor and Luke's rooms, then deciding who should get what.

As in all Professor Layton games, it was the detailed layering that intrigued me.  Proceed to a new scene, search for hint coins, stop and read the journal, click on character and solve his puzzle, get new gadgets for the minigames, stop and play a level of minigame, unlock a new bonus content.  So many options and so much to do before you can confidently say you've beat this game.

I would recommend this game for all ages."
3623,5,"Continuing the Resistance trilogy, this is the sequel to Resistance. The story is a virus begins in Russia in an alternate reality and spreads across Europe. The virus converts humans into mutants called the Chimera. In this game the virus has spread to the United States and Nathan Hale, the hero of the first game now must fight the Chimera on his home ground. A very good follow up game to the original."
3624,5,Works for both Rs3 and old runescape. Just make sure to link your runescape account on it. Also the credit is instant so once the paymen is process you have your credit in seconds.
3625,5,"Games like these are the reason why I am still playing my PS2. Whether you're new to baseball (like me), or a seasoned veteran, this game has depth for weeks. The graphics and animation will make you smile, and the game play is solid gold. This is actually one of the last gems for the PS2, so if you still have the classic black box sitting around, and enjoy sports games, this one is a no-brainer. It's also under 10 bucks on Amazon, which makes it amazing value for money!"
3626,5,Great game played today
3627,5,"mild scratches. scuff marks, think can be buffed out, but nice price if not working when i play  it, as i am busy playing one of many games that i bought for ps2, ps3, ps4! resident evil code veronica x on ps2/game cube is a GREAT game! no detailed explanation needed, if you played res. evil on ps1 a unique fun hard sometimes puzzle solving game. highly worth it! if you played these in the old days like devil may cry, onimusha series, this is way up there! with res. evil. 1 REmake on game cube/ps4, even the original or directors cut!!!"
3628,5,thanks
3629,5,"Works exactly as I expected. Very smooth, crisp rumble that adds a lot to gameplay. The original is superior to bulky knockoffs and it connects much better to the controllers."
3630,5,"I really have nothing to say, everything has been said. Great Game!!! loads of FuN!!! If you like stealth games or anything like that you'll Love this one. Great Story and great Characters, haven't had this much fun in game since Metal Gear Solid 4. Guns Of The Patriots. I really enjoyed this game."
3631,5,one of the best thing i bought for my computer Xbox 360 controllers are better then PlayStation controllers
3632,5,I've bought every limited edition cod game and this one is just as excellent as the others love it!  If you're a fan you should buy this if you can find it lol
3633,5,"Great game, fast shipping"
3634,5,"This game is lots of fun, even if the story is borderline retarded. The packaging is also very pretty, though it came a bit damaged when I got it. Still, super great package."
3635,5,"While the ""8th gen"" versions of Just Dance 2016 are changing up the formula with subscription services, smartphone app controls, new modes, and the removal of certain modes, the ""7th gen"" ps3 version is more of a straightforward Just Dance for those not looking for too many radical changes.  Much like Just Dance 2015 basically took Just Dance 2014 and tweaked the formula a bit with a few new features and improvements to existing features, the ps3 version of Just Dance 2016 is, essentially, a slightly improved/tweaked version of Just Dance 2015 with a new song list.

One of the most notable things about this version of the game is that it still includes the popular World Dance Floor mode (allowing you to dance online live with everyone else playing on the same console to try and get the highest score), which has been removed in the next gen versions and replaced with the new ""World Video Challenge"" mode (to the dismay of some fans).  That alone might be a selling point for the ps3 version over the newer gen versions.  It's an especially odd omission given the fact that the World Dance Floor formed the basis for the Just Dance World Cup, part of the Electronic Sports World Cup, over the last two years.

Overall, the song list is about par for the course, with a smattering of pop hits, older/classic songs, fun cultural references (like the inclusion of ""You're the One That I Want"" from Grease), and quirkiness (like songs/dances based on Angry Birds, Hatsune Miku, and fun songs like ""I'm an Albatraoz"" and the delightfully goofy and spastic ""Chiwawa"", which might, at this point, be my favorite track and dance in the game).  There's a little something for everyone, and even the tracks that aren't really your cup of tea are usually fun to dance to.

As far as other features go, they're pretty much all straight out of Just Dance 2015.  You have your standard unlockables, the ability to score extra coins by singing along to the songs karaoke-style, your wall (where you can see news, challenges, and things you have completed), an improved and more customizable sweat mode where you can create your own playlist and have an actual kcal counter (as opposed to past games, which would say things like ""you've done the equivalent of swimming the English Channel""), the tournament (where you are ranked each month based on your overall World Dance Floor score compared to other players), etc.  Really, the layout and look and features, despite a small facelift, are pretty much right out of Just Dance 2015, even down to some of the menu/intro music.

So, in the end, if you want a wide selection of streaming songs through their (paid) subscription service, the ability to use your phone as a controller, and the new gaming/multiplayer modes they've added, then, by all means, go with the ps4/xbox one/wii u version.  If your philosophy is more along the lines of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", and you just want to pick up your move controller and play the new songs in a familiar layout with familiar features (especially if you're disappointed by the exclusion of the World Dance Floor for newer consoles...or just haven't upgraded to a newer console yet), then the ps3 version is a fine choice and a solid addition to the Just Dance series."
3636,5,Very well made figure. Activision quality.
3637,5,"+Very durable/solid feeling (no creaks); doesn't move around when clamped down to a table.
+Force feedback is very powerful when turned all the way up in-game.
+900 degree turning feels more realistic than than non-900 degree wheels
+Extra tuning dials for GT5 Prologue; I think this is the only wheel that has this feature.
+Pedals have a claw that prevents it from moving forward on carpeted floors.
+Shifter stick is easily reachable with your fingers while not having to take your right palm off the wheel.
+GT logo lights up

-PS button doesn't work unless the game is programmed to use it (so far only GT5 Prologue can use it); you still need to use a PS3 controller to access the XMB.

other thoughts:
*Start/Select buttons could have been placed in a better position.
*Would've been nice if the shifter stick could be toggled to act as L1/R1 or L2/R2 buttons (most PS2 games don't recognize the shift stick so you have to use the other buttons to shift).
*Lots of wires, but they're long enough; wheel to system, pedal to wheel, and power adapter.
*The GT logo button doesn't do anything.
*Noisy, though that's probably the case will all force feedback wheels.
*These usb wheels are not backwards compatible with PS1 games because the PS1 wheels use controller port connectors instead of usb connectors.
*Some reviewers say that it will not clamp onto thicker tables, but they obviously have not read the manual. If you have a thick table, be sure to remove the two extensions on the clamps so it can fit. I have a 2"" thick table and it fits perfectly.

Games I've tested with on PS3 60GB:
Gran Turismo 3 - Works; no 900 degree steering.
Gran Turismo 4 - Works very well.
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue - Works perfectly; this wheel was designed for this game.
GRID - Works very well.
R Racing Evolution - Doesn't work well; for some reason I cannot get full acceleration.
Ridge Racer V - Not supported.
Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 - Works; no 900 degree steering or shift stick support.
Tokyo Xtreme Racer Drift - Works well; no 900 degree steering or shift stick support.
Tokyo Xtreme Racer Drift 2 - Works well; no 900 degree steering or shift stick support.
Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero - Not supported.

Fast shipping from Amazon even with Free Super Saver shipping, and item arrived in perfect condition. I was going to buy this a few months ago but I'm glad I waited because they've dropped the price now. Very satisfied with this wheel."
3638,5,"I had this item before, works just fine thanks again"
3639,5,Simply amazing. Improved upon battlefield 3 in every way
3640,5,"An amazing game with good DLC's beyond it, worth buying.
Thank you."
3641,5,"""Tomb Raider: Underworld"" picks up where ""Legend"" and ""Anniversary"" left off. It's a wonderful culmination of the previous two games that allowed the developers to polish and re-develop Lara's character, while pushing the storyline.

Each level is quite large and visually stunning. There are limits, but the levels are so extensive and detailed that they are negligible. This game is not for the novice or the person just wanting to seek and destroy. Each level of the game contains multiple puzzles that take some time to figure out. This is a game of patience and wit. Often, the player must manipulate Lara's acrobatic and nimble abilities to navigate seemingly impossible paths.

I enjoyed this game because it challenges the player to think three-dimensionally to solve puzzles, plan routes of escape, discover alternate destinations, and defeat enemies. Every room and situation involves a concealed scalable wall, path, puzzle, or clue to the games finale, while at the same time allowing the player to develop a compassion for the character so not to send her plummeting to her death or become smashed by some massive object rotating or swinging around the room.

Strengths include:
-The continuing storyline from the previous Tomb Raider games.
-Lara is better-looking and continues to appear more realistic.
-The ability to refer to Lara's PDA for clues on what the current objective is or how to possibly execute it.
-Game physics have improved and appear more fluid and smooth.
-Free Downloadable content

Semi-weaknesses:
-I would like the ability to choose between different types of hand guns or rifles. Lara's options are limited by the choice of only one type of each: An AR-15, a Remington 870, spear gun, tranquilizer, Uzi's, and H&K's. It would be nice if you could choose between a Desert Eagle, 1911's, Beretta's, or the H&k: or AR-15, M4, Spaz 12, or a sniper rifle. -I would have liked the ability to use Thor's gloves indiscriminately, but I guess that would have made the game a little too easy. Maybe this can be explored in later installments.
-The outfit selection introduced in ""Legend"" and continued in ""Anniversary"" wasn't exploited anywhere near where it could have been. Unless you're conected to Xbox Live were you can down load other outfits: you can only choose between 2-3 outfits per level unlike ""Legend"" were you could wear pretty much whatever wherever after you unlocked it.

Weakness:
One thing I am not happy about is that Edios signed a deal with Microsoft to release two expansion packs for the game but only for xbox live customers. Now, it is cool to add more to the game, but the fact that it is only for Xbox 360 stinks for other platform owners. I don't feel it's fair business practice to deny other platforms the extra content.

I have always enjoyed the Tomb Raider games. The storylines are interesting: though fictional they are respectful to the audience. The creators do a wonderful job of creating tension and compassion for the main character, while not turning her into a cyber-$lut. The puzzles are always challenging and fun to solve again and again. This game is well done and I look forward to the continuing saga. I recommend it to players 12 or older, but that's up to the consumers discretion."
3642,5,great game.
3643,5,"We just got this game for my son yesterday, and it is so addicting even my husband and I can't quite put it down.  LOL  It is fun and now that you can compete online with others around the world.  The fun has only begun!"
3644,5,"Awesome game, great for any Marvel fan!
Great gameplay, great selection of characters and powers, and a cool plot."
3645,5,I LOVED IT!!!
3646,5,Fun game. Rockstar games are for the most part always quality especially the GTA series.
3647,5,"Boxed beautiful well taken care of like brand new he loves it it's the
The price was right"
3648,5,"With over 150 games due out by the end of the year, it's a very exciting time to be a DS owner. Nintendo's latest handheld is something totally different and never before attempted. It allows games to be played with two screens and further immerses the gamer in the game with touchscreen and microphone capabilities. Unlike the PSP, the DS is a reasonably priced handheld with reasonably priced games. Very afforadble and very durable, something a handheld needs to be, something that is stardard for all Nintendo products. Nintendo is a company that is all about innovation and finding new ways to increase the gamers interaction with the game, while having lots of fun. The DS is further proof of this. I highly reccommend Nintendo DS to anyone who wants a handheld that is actually worth you time and money. And for those who may think the features are gimmicks, please play ""Yoshi's Touch n Go"" ""Kirby's Touch"", ""The Metroid Demo"", or ""Wario Ware"". These are great games only possible on a DS, and yes, DS will also have more upcoming ""traditional"" games if that's all you're into."
3649,5,"You have all heard of this game. May have played it, many have praised it. But here's my take on it. I bought this game when it first came out. I hadn't heard of it til GS posted their review. I heard great things about it and had extra money so I went out and purchased it. It was one of the best blind buys I have ever made.

From the opening scene I was drawn into this world. It is one that we have rarely scene: it is beautiful, but I'll get to that later on. The storyline is very simple: driven by revenge, Kratos (the ""hero"" of our tale) embarks on an epic journey to bring down Ares, the God of War. There is more to it than that but you need to play this game in order to truly appreciate it. I won't ruin anything here.

Graphics. This is one of the best looking games of this generation. Period. Second only to, IMO, Metal Gear Solid (I'm talking consoles, not PC games remember). Everything is just gorgeous. The characters move ever so fluidly. The character models are great to look at. Some of course are less detailed than others but its easily able to overlook these as you'll be caught up in everything else. The locales are beautiful. More than once you'll stop and just looks around and take everything in. This also leads me into the art of the game. The art direction is fantastic. There are normal cutscenes and there are the different ones (you'll know these). The art direction in these different scenes are simply captivating. The style of art used is one of which I myself have never witnessed in a game before. The characters and environments are 2D but are treated as 3D. It's elegant really. A sight to behold. The worlds look wonderful as well. Everything is so lush and beautiful, just like Greece is made out to be. Everything is detailed down to the last rock or brick (or whatever they used back then). No detail is too small, which is quite commendable.

The sound in this game is again, IMO, second only to MGS3. The music in this is comparable to that of a big budget Hollywood production. Everything music-wise fits perfectly with the situation at hand. Sometimes it is quite subtle too as to where you don't directly notice it but sets the mood and would hamper the game were it not there. The voice acting is strong as well. Everyone fits their role and not one that I can remember seems awkward or out of place. Linda Hunt is wonderful as the narrator. Her distinct voice fits perfectly and is a joy to hear every time she speaks. Kratos' voice actor (Terrence Carson) is great as well. He brings his own personality to Kratos and it fits like a shoe. Everyone else is strong as said before.

Gameplay is amazingly fluid. Combos are awesome looking yet simple to pull off. This is great for someone like me who was never too fond of game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat's complex combo controls. I never liked have to push up, down, left, right, left, left, left, diagonal up left, diagonal down right, B, B, A, up and B to pull off a combo. In God of War it is as simple as O,O,O. That's it but it pulls off an amazing looking combo. Its all fluid and a true joy to use. It makes the game that much better.

One very large fault in this game is its length. It can be beaten, first time through, in less than 8 hours. I am now at the point where I can beat it on God Mode in under 5. On all the difficulty levels (except God Mode) it's way too easy. Yes there are some choke points but overall, its too damn easy. I like a challenge in my games and definetly want them to last longer than this did, expecially if it is this good. There are some graphical glitches every now and then and not all the characters are up to par. Some are downright muddy, but miles ahead of other games'. The level design in Hades is the worst part of the game. Its some horrible platforming that goes on and on. The wall of spikes annoyed the hell out of me, it's damn hard.

This game is an instant classic. Its how games should be. Its fun, it sounds amazing, it plays great, it has wonderful characters, an awesome story and a heart. If you like action games you need to pick this game up, there's really no two ways about it."
3650,5,As good as the original
3651,5,"yes, I like it... the premium edition is nice and the game with the new update is enjoyable.. good job"
3652,5,"While at first it seemed like a pain to have to buy this to get any headphones other than ms to fit in the controller, I'm so glad I I did. Having instant mute and volume buttons right there is awesome especially when playing with others online. A busy family around can get loud sometimes and a lot of times I have to answer questions and quickly solve problems while playing. A quick tap on the mute button helps to take care of things without disturbing anyone online. It's also handy when I need to grab something to eat and not bother anyone with chewing sounds. Also, if you have an older controller, it will help you get away from crappy ms headsets that seem to break far too easily."
3653,5,Great
3654,5,"Worked great on my Wii. Have had a third party large memory card, and multiple card 59's, and I still play many GameCube games today on my wii. When I ran out of room, I had read some cards had issues with the wii, but the reviews for this were great, I decided to purchase it. I'm happy to say it works flawlessly on the Wii. Managed to transfer many games from the third party card to this (I'm afraid to remove it from my wii as I once removed it and it gave multiple errors when trying to put it back in). I never had issues with third party on the GameCube, but on the wii its kinda finicky. I highly recommend this, please do not go for cheaper memory cards for the wii, stick with this official card."
3655,5,Great Product
3656,5,Bought this months ago for 3yr old nephew to aide him in racing games which he loves. It is still in brand new condition and used constantly. The steering wheel helps him keep confidence and skill level closer to his older brother. Very pleased and worth the money.
3657,5,Good product
3658,5,"bryanreo@sbcglobal.net And I say that Resident Evil 2 is perhaps one of the best resident evils for the PS1. The sheer horror of the initial run to the police station is just the beginning. Then you must fight your way through the zombie infested maze. This game will have you jumping when you hear a noise outside. This is the game to get if you want to be scared for a few weeks after beating it. It took me about 5 hours I think it was, perhaps 6 hours. But I like to make sure all the zombies are dead. This game is a must if you are a fan of RE-1"
3659,5,"""As usual the PS3 exclusive takes the cake for another great game. Both graphically and game play wise there is not a funner off road game out there. The psychics are incredible and never the same twice. Puts you right in the race. Awesome."""
3660,5,had a blast playing it
3661,5,Excellent!
3662,5,Works great.  Glad I got this at a good price.
3663,5,Ive been a fan of the series since its debut and even though this installment was developed by different people it still lives up to the quality and legacy of its predecessors.
3664,5,"Ryse was the most visually stunning game I've played, and to have as much action and explosions as it had I can honestly say it's a great game. I gave it 5 stars, I have two small problems however which if I could I would put it at 4.5. The first one is the story, there's only eight chapters in the game, however they're long I wish there was a thicker story. The second is multiplayer weaponry. In the game you use sword and shield, which you can't change. In multiplayer you get swords through packages which you buy with gold you earn in game. There's nothing special about these swords, all they have are different bonuses. And they're not speed or damage, they're XP bonus and crowd appreciation bonus. There are others but you get the point. Overall it was a great game, good story, good combat system, and impeccable graphics."
3665,5,Love this game
3666,5,"I recall this getting panned when it released and wondering why. I personally thought this was a brilliant expansion. The epic journey to find the cause of the rise of Vampirism was incredible IMO. Travelling to another world as part of that was cool as hell. Also, this game reveals the actual origin of the Falmer, which was incredible IMO. The new areas, the awesome journey, the intense battles....they really amazed me. Plus, being able to join the Dawnguard and use their fortress as a base of operations just made it even better. Really a must play."
3667,5,"Tired of wading through endless and trite back-stories with relentless and ubiquitous cut-scenes and overtly complex fight/gear management systems? Want to be hacking through foes, collecting loot, and leveling up nearly every step of the way from the outset? Did you like Titan Quest or the Diablo series? Then Torchlight is the game for you.

Classes - In Torchlight you assume one of three different classes. Within each class you gain skills that allow you to fine tune your play-style through acquiring abilities from three different trees. The higher your level the more options in each of the trees become available to you. Any skill in any tree is available to you at any time, so long as you've gained the level necessary to open that skill. The classes are well balanced, though my limited experience with the ranged class led me to believe it might be a little under powered.

Loot - Very much like any other game from Diablo to World of Warcraft. Enemies, some quest-givers, and chests drop loot. Weapons and armor come in a variety of flavors from plain to epic. Gear can be enchanted and/or socketed to gain new abilities and/or powers. You can sell items in town or transmute them to create new gems.

Pet - This is probably the most significant change from Diablo found in Torchlight. You choose a cat or dog and it follows you throughout the game. Fighting along with you, storing extra loot for you, or returning to town to sell loot. You can equip your pet with spells as well as rings and amulets to increase it's ability in combat. In addition you can feed it fish to grant it certain powers for a period of time.

Etc. - One feature that really stands out is the shared chest. Each character has his/her own personal chest as well as a chest that can store items for use with any of your other characters. This is incredibly useful as you're constantly picking up unique or rare items that other classes can use. The shared adds alot of replay to the game. The graphics are great as well.

The only areas that I might knock are level design, and lack of multiplayer. Dungeons are randomly generated, but I've seen alot of repeats in a short period of time. Though each level feels just about right in terms of size/time spent, I think some levels could have been made larger/longer. Especially those levels which precede entirely new areas.

Games like this really benefit from the option of having multi-player. The lack of it doesn't hurt the experience, but it's inclusion, especially after beating the game solo a couple of times, would greatly enhance this game. My understanding is that multi-player is a planned expansion, so I wouldn't knock the developer too much for that miss."
3668,5,"It was exactly what I expected. A nunchuk controller for Wii in black. Not a lot to say about it, but it works well and was the official brand."
3669,5,I love this system. I have an xbox 360 and I love this one more. It's not so much the gaming aspect but the fact that I don't have to pay Sony in order to use the network benefits. I can play games and stream with Netflix or Amazon at no additional fee. Wake-up Microsoft!
3670,5,"When I first got into Heroes of the Storm I wanted to support the game and purchase a few skins, but I found that adding funds straight to your battle.net account could be somewhat of a hassle. These cards are massively convenient as there's no waiting period and you get your code instantly. They also make great gifts for friends, since at the time of this review HotS doesn't have a real gifting system yet. I can easily purchase a card and send the code to my boyfriend, so he can treat himself to a new skin or hero, it's very convenient."
3671,5,This game is a must have. You won't want to put it down
3672,5,works perfectly
3673,5,Very long game for your dollar. Good story line good graphics.
3674,5,"I loved the gameplay for both campaign and multiplayer. Enjoyed this multiplayer better than AC: Revelations. Game storyline is very well written, and the new platform even when not perfect (you will see) presents more versatility in the game and movements. I will buy all DLC."
3675,5,"I bought this game for my niece who is 8 years old and she loves it. I decided to give it a go and I am hooked on this game. I am 35. My middle school niece and nephew also loves to play this game. It has become a household favorite with the players ranging from 8 to thier 40s with both genders loving this game. It is simple with some difficulty that keeps it interesting along with it just bieng a nice change of pace. Thankfully they have fashion contest in the game that doesn't require one to use multiplayer unless they just want to. We are in an incredibly small town and never have much luck finding anyone hosting a fashion show through multiplayer. So having a contest in the game play was great for us. The boutique part is fun and there are so many styles and clothes that keeps the game from becoming routine and boring. With the clothes, apartment redecorating, remolding choices for your store, the hair and makeup salon, the game has so much customization and that is something I personally love in a game. The more customization the better in my own opinion. The only thing that has been a problem is there is only one save file for this game. When you have only one Nintendo in a large household you need more than one save for a game. Right now the shop is is like a community boutique and this causes some problems at times. Why game developers create games with only one player is beyond me but I sincerely hope that there will be a way to create other players that does not involve any hacking or whatever. We need more than one save file!! But other than that this is a great fun game that has something for everyone despite age or gender."
3676,5,Loved this game on the ps3 now i can take it to go. Have the 1st ninja garden sigma for vita great game. wish more games were coming out for vita but it looks like thats drying up. decided to go back and get the classics before they're gone
3677,5,"Superb!  I loved the elevator which played typical elevator music while changing floors and then it bumped each time it started and stopped.  I laughed every time I rode it.  Great storyline and ending.  It was strange how the subject wanted out of Shady Pines, but when she got outside to go to the garage, she went back in the hospital.  Why didn't she escape then and bring help?  Great game though.  Worth every penny."
3678,5,Works nicely with the Mario Maker Wii.
3679,5,Product arrived on time and as described
3680,5,"Two words come to mind when playing silent hill homecoming, holy crap. This is above all one of the scariest games I have ever played. Around almost every corner you come face to face with a hideous creature, other than Brittney Spears :O.(LOL):D Anyway, this is a really good game and I love playing it. It is a heart-pounding, breath-taking game that is really fun to play. I give this game 2 thumbs up."
3681,5,"This game reminds me so much of the Virtua cop and Virtua squad games from back in the day, I used to love those games and play them over and over trying to beat my score. I like the fact that you can calibrate the wiimote to get it to work more accurately then other wii shooter games. I tried it with the wii zapper but found it easier with out it."
3682,5,good
3683,5,"Yeah! Back to those days when there wasn't other game so exiting like this one. It's happening again but kinda reloaded. The graphics and details puted in this version are awesome! Playing again the campaign, feeling again the frenetic slaughter! Playing this game back makes me stand in the past but in ten future..."
3684,5,"I have a general question about the Wii that hopefully someone can answer.  I understand you can play NES and SNES games on the Wii that are being released each week.  Now, let's say you purchase a game like Zelda for the NES or SNES.  Will the Wii save your progress on these games, or is it just a play when you want then shut it off and have to start over every time type thing?  I know the Wii will save it's own games, but does it also save older games??  Thanks for any info anyone can give.

P.S. I had no idea you could download older games, that alone makes this system blow Xbox and PS3 out of the water!"
3685,5,"This is my favorite of the Playnix games, and I have about 10 of them.  Find-an-object games are more interesting to me than match-three games, and taking care of the fish, decorating the tanks, and watching the fish swim around makes the game satisfying and addictive. There was no problem at all downloading it with the Amazon downloader, and it has worked perfectly for me. Lots of fun!"
3686,5,Its just perfect and more comfortable!
3687,5,Product was very nice
3688,5,Best game 10/10
3689,5,Good game. Great copy.
3690,5,"It saddened me to hear this compilation was discontinued.  However, in the back of my mind I always knew I would end up with this game one way or another.  When I saw my local game shop had one last copy of this for $49, I had to buy it.  It was cvompletely worth the purchase.

Metroid Prime 1 + 2 were among the best GameCube titles ever in my opinion, so those were my two main drives at buying this.  It also includes the third game, which is exceptionally awesome as well.  The controls from the third game (which is a Wii-exclusive) carry back to the first two games.  The implementation of motion controls for this game is immaculate.  There's only a few moments where I felt like it'd be better to use the GameCube controller like 'back in the day', but I quickly got over it as I found myself digging deeper into the game (once again).

Also coming back for this, is the multiplayer mode from Metroid Prime 2.  Basically, you and three of your friends can grab a remote and nunchuck each and shoot at each other.  It's very fun, however it'd probably be worth constantly checking back on if there were some form of Nintendo Wi-Fi connection compatibility.  So you cannot take the multiplayer online, which is kinda sad seeing as how everyone else seems to be bringing retro gaming online.

What else can I say?  Hmm... the game comes in a very heavy-duty metal case, with a plastic slip-cover.  Inside the case is the game, an instruction book (not a manual, or a booklet even, this thing is quite seriously a book.  Probably the thickest instruction manual I've ever seen!), an art booklet, and of course the usual Nintendo inserts.

Aside from the lack of online modes, my only complaint (which doesn't really affect me) is that this was discontinued.  Now the price of this game will probably skyrocket because people are greedy and think that because a game isn't in print it means we'll pay outrageous prices for a game disc.

The sad thing is, it'd still be worth it.  This is the most incredible deal you could find in Wii gaming, not for the price but for the content.  Metroid Prime is one of the best game trilogies of all time, so whether you've already trekked through Tallon IV or not, this one's definitely worth your time!"
3691,5,Great for world of Warcraft and everyday use i highly recommend :)
3692,5,works great i am never leaving controllers laying around anymore!
3693,5,"it didn't come the way they said it would, but its fine anyway"
3694,5,"While there a are are racing games (PGR), driving sims (Forza), and a boatload of street racing games (NFS), there really aren't any true racing sims for todays consoles.  Simbin has created many of the finest sims that call the PC home, but until this release, they haven't made the leap to consoles.  Was it worth the wait?

Yes, and no

Yes, Simbin racing simulator fans will enjoy the challenging gameplay and simulation of racing with the convenience of playing on a console.  While challenging, various levels of difficulty opens the game up to all players, and the ease of Xbox Live makes the outstanding multiplayer experience all the more accessible.

No, its not for everyone.  First off, it is needlessly rough around the edges.  As others have noted, more time or money could have given the game polish both in the menus and while driving.  If you enjoy Forza, but want a bit more of a challenge, this may be a good game to try."
3695,5,"The Titanfall bundle is a fairly good value. The game Titanfall delivers a fun, fast-paced FPS experience. The Xbox One was better than I expected. It has a sleek interface, runs quietly, and the Kinect functions better than I thought it would. I have not had any problems with it recognizing my voice or doing anything weird. I love this product so far, and I recommend others look into the Xbox One as this generation of consoles goes forward"
3696,5,Bought for my son for christmas. Havent okayed it yet buy iy came fast and was greatky pre packed.  Cant wait to play it!!! He will be so exvited!!!!!
3697,5,"If you like games that are innovative and unique, you'll almost definitely like Animal Crossing.  If you've ever played ""The Sims"", you already have a good idea for the basic concept of the game.  It's not so much about achieving a specific objective (e.g. fighting bad guys, saving the world, etc.) as it is about just hanging out, making friends, living your life, and having a good time.
The cool thing is that this game makes use of a concept that doesn't exist in The Sims.  Namely, the entire world operates on a real-time clock.  As it says on the box things happen ""whether you're there or not"".  This means that the game world is constantly changing from day-to-day.  When the seasons change in real life, they change in the game.  When there's a holiday in real life, they're celebrating it there in the game, too.  Things you do have long-lasting consequences.  If you plant a tree one day, you will notice it growing for several days afterwards.  If you're mean to someone in town, they will pack up and move away.  This isn't the kind of game you get through in a week.  This game is fun to play for an hour or two every day so you can see what has changed since the last time you played.  Also, unlike The Sims, you don't have any annoying meters telling you what your hygiene, hunger, sleep, entertainment levels are.  You don't HAVE to do anything.  You can just do what you want and have fun.
I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age. One word of caution, though.  This game is extremely addictive, especially because of its ever-changing nature.  Be prepared to say goodbye to your free time for a while if you get this."
3698,5,"Warning: Don't buy this game if you don't have a lot of free time, because it will suck up major amounts of time. AC:NL is the best Animal Crossing game yet for many reasons, not least of all the addition of bushels, which allow you to collect large amounts of fruit (9 per slot) and sell them at a time. The Island is fantastic. If I didn't already have a 3DS, I would buy it solely for this game. I have a good amount of 3DS and DS games and they just don't get played any more."
3699,5,this is a great attachment for the Kinect.  and it dose what it says.
3700,5,Love this game. I put in over 1000+ hours and still finding new things all the time also now they let you use mods for this game and the content just keeps rolling in.
3701,5,Great
3702,5,"These are great and add great length to your gamecube cord, That way playing with 4 people won't feel nearly as crowded as it would before."
3703,5,"Bought this instead of 12 Months because mom had the extra 60 to spend while I was gifted 50, so why not make it 10 dollars less for her and buy myself a 2 Year card? I'll surely be playing my Xbox One for a long time, and this'll help me do it. Love Microsoft and it's products, more than satisfied w/ an easy buy and code option. Amazon work's wonders."
3704,5,This was a great product that exceeded my expectations. It really is great for a gift.  I love it and will buy more.
3705,5,I enjoy playing this game. It is one of my favorite games. It is fun and entertaining.
3706,5,"I am not sure exactly what I expected when I got this game, but it definitely leans toward a mathematical mind.  I am no math genius, that's for sure!

All in all, I love the sudoku and virus blaster!  I could play virus blaster all day long."
3707,5,"I bought a used Wii-U and it works perfectly. My daughter had been wanting a Nintendo so that she could play Yoshi's Wolly World, and my wife and I really wanted to play Mario Kart since we grew up playing it. I have to say that this system does not disappoint."
3708,5,"Well, they do if you don't take care of this disks....

After all these years, Final Fantasy Tactics is still a game I enjoy returning to every once in a while. The engaging story and unique characters make it a truly enjoyable experience no matter how old you, or the game, get. And because of the class system, it can be played differently every time. Ever done a solo calculator run?

The simple graphics are reminiscent of a time when story mattered more than how the game looked. And even today, many games are attempting to recapture that ""retro look.""

Let's face it. This is a game you can come back to again and again and enjoy it every time. There are very few games that can make the same claim."
3709,5,As described
3710,5,Very good game
3711,5,good
3712,5,Awesome game!
3713,5,excellent!
3714,5,everything as advertised
3715,5,"Wow, where did this brand come from? For the price, this mouse is revolutionary.

Pros:

VALUE. For what you get, the price of this mouse doesn't even make sense. 9 buttons, ergonomic semi-vertical layout, detachable wrist rest, a DPI button, sensible software... holy cow.

Ergonomics. Previously I tried an Anker vertical mouse. I hated the Anker because my hand would still rest on the desk, putting pressure on the bones of my wrist and actually put some pressure on my pinky finger. This mouse has shaped spots for your thumb, ring, and pinky fingers. These natural resting spots allow for a lot of comfort. The wrist rest keeps my hand off the desk, so when I'm moving a lot I'm not dragging the heel of my hand. That's great.

Design. Although the mouse looks cool, every single aspect is functional. The cutout for your thumb has two buttons on either side of your thumb, and by default these are set to volume up and down. It's one of many smart, straightforward design decisions. Slightly above your natural thumb spot are the forward/back buttons, a nice way to make sure you don't hit them accidentally. Again, simple but brilliant.

Customization. You can toggle the DPI between four presets, all of which can be customized, with the touch of a button. The wrist wrest is removable. The included software is very easy to use, and quickly lets you customize any button. The mouse even has 3 removable weights in the base, in case you want it to be lighter. This is way more than you'd expect at this price point.

Better-than-price materials. Sure, the plastic feels a little cheap, but it's what you'd expect at this price. But the buttons feel good, the scroll wheel is great, the wrist rest is rubberized, and the cord has a premium braided cloth feel. Astonishing for the price.

Cons

Only for right-handed users.

I'm a guy with big hands, so I could use a slightly larger model. I feel like the mouse buttons slope down a bit much, so that if you rest your wrist on the rest, you have to reach really far forward to hit the buttons, farther forward than the scroll wheel, so you have to pull back to hit the scroll wheel again. I think if the mouse buttons didn't slope down quite as far, things would be a little more natural. The comfort is still good, it's just not perfect for me.

Overall, WOW. Tons of features, good materials, great sensor, great software. It's near perfect, and an amazing deal at its price."
3716,5,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game I have ever played in my entire life.
I have been playing nintendo for years and I have played some of the older Zelda games before but I never owned any, as soon as I tried this game - I immediately loved it and I've played it millions and millions of times.  I am so obsessed with it, I went out and pre-ordered the Wind Waker to get the Zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to Nintendo Power to get the Zelda Collector's Edition disc.
There is no need for me to review this game - all I really need to say is buy it.  You will not be disappointed (if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain).  Definitely be sure to get the follow up Majora's Mask and the Wind Waker.  A must play and Link is the best hero ever."
3717,5,"With these sorts of adapters, there's two keys to me ... is it truly plug-and-play, and does it introduce input lag to your game? Thankfully, the answer to both is good.

* The plug-and-play is accurate on Windows 7. Just make sure your single pad is plugged into the device before you attach via USB, and you should be all set. You will want to make sure to keep a picture or a scan of the back of the packaging so you understand how to change how some of the keys work, it's not terribly intuitive, but it's also necessary.

* In playing some emulated shooter games, where input lag is the most noticeable, and did not see any. As a result, this is one of the best ways to get some great old controllers like the Dual Shock 2, or the 6-button Saturn pad, into your newer games.

Expect some configuration with each game or each different pad you setup, but if you're experienced with emulation and these types of devices, that shouldn't make you reticent of getting this, it's worth the purchase."
3718,5,great price.  fast delivery.
3719,5,"Great Grip Caps, these are the larger version so they fit the PS3 and Xbox 360.

For the PS4, XBone and Switch (Pro Controller), you want the slightly smaller ones.

3720,5,none
3721,5,greate mistery game
3722,5,"This game was awesome for it's time. It was visually amazing, the sounds were sharp and realistic, and everyone was unique. If you used the cheat, you could unlock the two headed boss, Eyedol. That made the game experience even more fun. The CD it came with has awesome tracks to play as well if you manage to find one with it."
3723,5,Excellent
3724,5,"I bought haunting gronud because I wanted a little spin off of Silent Hill. This game is much like Silent Hill with the same creepy feel.

Because of the very mature themes expressed in the game I would not recommend this game for younger players. Suggestive themes, and violence. Also the characters that chase Fiona are pretty scary too.

For the more mature gamer this is a very fun game to play and allows you almost complete control over the plot of the game. Depending on the relationship you make with the dog companion, Hewie and the choices weather to show mercy to some of the characters makes this a fun game to play over again and explore the diffrent options you have.

Also after completing the game the first time through you are rewarded with the ""Secret Room"". I wish all video games were as rewarding when it came to completion! ""Secret Room"" gives you little extras about the game, mini games and a chance to look over the cut scenes you had seen while playing the game.

This is a very fun game to play and is fun to play with a partner (which I myself had done) with you."
3725,5,"Great product if you don't like using your debit/credit card, always a bonus to rack up the veteran bonuses, 3 months at a time"
3726,5,"After ZUMA's success, a number of clones appeared - but the LUXOR series is the one that actually improved on some aspects of the concept. As the series progressed, LUXOR games became more and more self-reliant. With LUXOR 3 the franchise finally comes to age.

A series of colored balls (with the number of different colors increasing every few levels) gets pushed and you have to match them in sets of three or more in order to remove them - and prevent them from reaching the end zone. Instead of having the ""shooter"" in the center, it is located at the bottom and it slides left and right. This makes for some quite difficult shots (especially when obstructed by the advancing row of balls) and raises the difficulty of the game.
On the other hand, the power-ups are more powerful, at the end of every round a number of coins and gems drop and ""catching"" them add lives to your paddle. It seems pretty straight-forward yet it can become highly...addictive!

Compared to the first installment of the series, LUXOR 3 is graphically more impressive, enriched as to the dropping bonuses (and...penalties) - yet it will seem somewhat easier to seasoned players of the series; nevertheless, it will fulfill the fans craving for more pharaohnic fun!

This is an example of what has come to be known as Casual Gaming: small, resource-light games that are fun for the whole family.
It would be a good idea to download the 60-min trial version from a casual games site, such as REFLEXIVE (you can Google it), and decide for yourself whether this is indeed your cup of tea. It wouldn't hurt to wait for the price to drop either: most casual games sell for no more than $10.

RECOMMENDED!"
3727,5,ok
3728,5,"These are AWESOME! Sure there are some bad reviews on these, but I think these people may have got the bad apples out the bunch.  I love them, they were cheaper then the Nintendo brand, and they just feel better in my hand.  The rubber grip, the buttons, the weight, it all just feels better then the Nintendo brand.  Plus, the ones I got, came in a kit which had the gun accessory and protection guard.  All this and it still was much cheaper then the Nintendo brand controller by itself.  These are a GREAT. 5 stars from me!!!"
3729,5,Great Game!
3730,5,"This game can be fun. Scare the crap out of you. And ultimately prevail. To me it's not the success, but the attempts and figuring out the weakness' of your Demons. It requires a lot of leveling and that is fun too which helps you practice and master techniques. It a nut shell, this game is awesome. You will die, die and die more times than one would in a platform game your trying to learn. But way more fun. It's not the challenge so much, but the experience of this masterful game. You either love it or hate it. I happen to love it."
3731,5,Purchased as a gift .  This game system allows you to play previous PlayStation games.  The PS4 does not allow you to do that.  This system comes with one controller and the The Last of Us game ( zombie game)  My daughter loves it.  I bought it for the capability of playing play station 2 and play station games.
3732,5,"I've been playing SWTOR since before launch, and I still love playing it. It's by no means perfect, but I've found it far more enthralling and satisfying than any other MMO I've ever played, which includes WoW, Rift, LOTR, and DDO; all of which I've played and enjoyed (except maybe for DDO). It obviously helps if you're a Star Wars fan and you enjoy games with interesting stories and characters. Also, don't forget that by MMO standards this game is still in its infancy: it's technically only been out a little over 4 months. The devs are listening to the community (ie the recent Guild Summit) and are adding tons of new things in upcoming updates. Even as the game is now though it keeps me coming back and I always enjoy myself. Like all MMOs it's obviously better with friends, but I still enjoy it almost as much when I'm soloing."
3733,5,"Before you download this game, you should definitely just go to the lotro website and get it there.  After you start downloading the game, it will give you the opportunity to play before the download is done.  I recommend not doing that because it will take even longer to get it downloaded.  The game is about 18gb to download.  Other games have that option and works well but with this game it doesnt.

I tried the game out back in january and played it for one day making a lvl 10 hunter.  It was weird playing it at first because the character graphics weren't very appealing.  After spending time with it though, i got use to and enjoyed my time.  I noticed when playing the game, nobody chatting and barely saw anyone.  The community is really small.  You should check out the forums to see which server is pretty active.  I went to the elemindir server because my friend had a character on that server.  So i played hunter to lvl 10, the game was getting a little bit harder.  So after one day i stopped playing and moved on to something else.  I've been mmo hoping for awhile now and was anticipating ESO release.  When eso released, it was fun at first but i got annoyed with it due to player bots in the dungeons and gold spammers and maintenance every few days.  Also, for the price of the game, i didn't feel like i got my moneys worth.

So i decided to give lotro a try again.  This time i started over and went with a hobbit burglar and the story appealed to me more.  So i spent the weekend playing it and got to lvl 15.  The game does a good job on its tutorial and showing you where to go to do certain things.  The game really grew on me so i decided to get the vip account plus the quad pack.  I was going to wait on the quad pack but i noticed a horse comes with it and its cheaper than the one they sell in the market.  So i went ahead and got it.  I am a little disappointed though because it didn't give the horse riding skill with the pack and i had to either wait to level 20 or spend TP on it.  So i spent the points and got it.  Trust me, you'll want the horse early on.  The world is huge and its a lot better to have a horse.  If you want to skip out on the quad pack, you could just get the sam wise pack which gives you a horse and the skill.  I would have figured the quad pack would have given the skill.  I haven't invested in the helms deep expansion and i won't till i need it.  More than likely i will wait for it to go on sale.

Playing the burglar is a lot of fun.  You can stealth your way through mobs and on the advanced skill traits, you can invest in it and make it harder for you to get caught.  The game also offers a lot on the crafting system.  My friend made me some high quality gear yesterday and it turned out very helpful.  With the game game being free to play.  The store offers a lot of make things easier for you.  For example with the crafting system, you can buy advanced ingredients from the store so you don't have to go collect it.  I was curious and tried it out.  The developers protected the game with making the items produced being bound to your account.  So you cant take advantage of it and sell it on the auction house.  Actually, you cant sell anything from the store to the auction house.  Makes it a little rough for players who cant spend money on the game.  However, the game does offer a way to earn TP points by doing your deeds but it can be very time consuming.  On the forums, a lot of people came up with a way on how to collect a lot by doing multiple characters. You can make 2 characters on each server and the tp you earn goes to your account.  So thats an alternate way of doing it.  Anyway, i'm really enjoying this game and the story line does keep you interested.  Just remember, the game has a small community so it may be wise to plan on which server to play on and to find a guild before you get fully started."
3734,5,Play it all the time
3735,5,Dead Space 3 is a very good game if you like these kinds of game then you will love this game. If you played Dead Space 1 and 2 then you will love this game too.
3736,5,"Great device. Easily setup by plugging into USB slot and downloading appropriate drivers (easily located with Google search). From there, it functions as an Xbox 360 would; you can just sync wireless controllers to it as you would a system.

I have been using mine for a long time now, and have hooked up somewhere between 4-6 controllers to it, with zero problems. Product works like a charm, and has been a godsend for allowing me to hook up my pile of Xbox controllers to my PC.

A must-have for PC gamers who like to use Xbox 360 controllers for some of their games."
3737,5,Great pricing. Awesome product quality. Fast shipping. Will do business again.
3738,5,Thank you it's amazing item
3739,5,perfect game
3740,5,Cool oldschool game! Plays on 2nd generation PS3! Needs a mouse to really enjoy!
3741,5,"It's really difficult to find these in stores due to how outdated the GBA and Gamecube are these days, but I'm glad I found them here.  Now I can play some older games with my friends!"
3742,5,Just what was needed. Thanks!
3743,5,excellent game only issue it's that most part of the game is in Japanese language but main menu have parts on english and that makes playable
3744,5,great!
3745,5,"On both my big gaming rigs it works great, on the ps vita is pretty fast paced and playable, it has kept me entertained  during long journeys, and having good old bloody fun on the road."
3746,5,Good character for mario party
3747,5,"It was great to be able to play this game again! I played it the first time on the GameCube and that was probably my favorite console to play it on since having a controller made it much easier. After that I got a Wii in college and picked it up and beat it again, I'm a huge Legend of Zelda fan.

Playing it with the Wii U gamepad and updated graphics has been a joy so far. Let me say I've heard from people that played it before that they really don't care to play it again but if you're a big fan of this game it's got some cool updated features and amiibo compality extras."
3748,5,Fits perfectly on the 2 screens and gives excellent protection from the kids scratches and fingerprints.  This is a must have if you buy this for children and or for yourself.
3749,5,"I bought this for my 5 yr old son. We are huge Super Mario fans. This has alot of replay value, and you can play up to 5 players. Great mini games also. Highly recommend for any and all Nintendo/Super Mario fans."
3750,5,"This was the 1st game I played on the xbox one.  I was blown away by the graphics and I like this Far Cry even better than FC3.  Spectacular scenery and outdoor sounds that I just wanted to immerse in.  It does follow a formula seen in other Far Cry games, but that is ok with me.  This is some of gaming's best AI for making you feel like you are really being hunted down by pursuers.  This is Ubisoft, so there are lots of drug trips to Shangrila if you choose to do the side missions.  Those scenes are spectacularly beautiful, but the gameplay there is so frantic you can hardly take it in.  The only thing I did not love was the ending with the procedural boss battle.  Voice acting is Hollywood quality.  Watch out for the freakin rhinos--they don't give up once riled.  :)"
3751,5,"Castlevania - Portrait of Ruin is a classic side-scrolling adventure pitting Jonathan and Charlotte against vampires, skeletons and other baddies.

If you haven't played the other Castlevania games you might be a little lost going into this. They don't spend a lot of time on plot development or letting you know who is who. It really comes down to Jonathan Morris being the 'fighter' while Charlotte Aulin is the 'magic user'. You can have one or both of them on screen at any given time. Not only do they fight together as a team, but they can puzzle solve as well.

For example, you can have one of them stand on a pedestal, and use the other one to push the pedestal along to a new ledge. There aren't tons of these puzzles, but enough to keep things interesting.

The graphics are engaging enough to keep you interested without getting overly complicated. They do a good job portraying the skeletons and other monsters with the pixels they have available.

One of the fun aspects of Castlevania games is the level design. Levels have multiple tiers to each area and you go up, down and around trying to figure out how to progress. It's a logic puzzle to figure out how to get past blocking obstructions.

If you're addicted to three dimensions then this old-school fun might not be quite your cup of tea. However, there really is a simple elegance to a side scrolling adventure. It's a puzzle, how to navigate through the maze, how to use your pair of skills to overcome different types of enemies.

Also, the music and sound is rather well done. It helps draw you into the atmosphere of the game.

The game is super for what it offers. Monster-killing fun. Side-scrolling puzzles. A good team of characters. If this is the kind of game you tend to enjoy, then Castlevania will be right up your alley."
3752,5,Would buy again. No problems.
3753,5,I think Pop Cap makes the best Hidden Object Game .... just straight forward find the objects and move on ... no silliness in between. Some views are a little dark and hard to see ... but still a good game.
3754,5,"The first baseball computer game I ever owned was ""HardBall!"" for the Mac.  Black and white, two teams, cheezy as all get-out, but I loved it.  I played a whole season once, 162 games, tracking home run stats, with those two teams.
Since then, I never owned a baseball game...  until now.  And man, Sammy Sosa's High Heat 2001 is one hell of a game.  The depth and breadth of the game is incredible, from the accuracy of the  team rosters to the inclusion of the newest ballparks to the trading  model... *gasp for breath* ...it goes on and on.
To the folks below: If  you computer is crashing, it's not the game, because SSHHBB2001(for short)  has never crashed on me.  Try a clean reinstall of your system.  Any true gamer knows that the real heart of any game is how the  game PLAYS.  Graphics mean absolutely diddly.
And anyway, SSHHBB2001 has  great graphics!  Players faces are mapped onto their bodies, they run,  throw and bat realistically, different batters' stances are accurately  depicted, the stadiums are accurate down to the advertising and the color  of the infield dirt... what game were you playing?
And as far as the  gameplay goes, SSHHBB2001 has wonderful gameplay.  You can play as pitcher,  batter, pitcher and batter, or manager.  There are myriad options for  customizing your game, making management decisions, etc etc... Plus the  game offers X different modes: Exhibition mode to play a single game  matching any two teams, Season mode to play a whole season, career mode to  (theoretically) play as long as you can, creating your own stats, Hall of  Fame, on and on and on.  There are also batting practice and Home Run Derby  modes.  Man, I've had this game a week and I already know my girlfriend  will kill herself for buying it for me. :)
Bottom line: Great graphics.  Stellar gameplay.  Incredible depth, plus infinite tweaking available in  the tune.txt file.  This game has it all, and I suspect I'll be playing it  even more than I played HardBall!."
3755,5,"You can go anywhere on Talos I in the similar way to Metroid Prime.

From recycling trash so can you can use stuff for anything, scanning species to see what makes them tick, & using neuromods to grant yourself amazing abilities Human or Typhon.

The game itself has themes that really question about your own choices, what is reality, who is deceiving you and who isn't; including what it means to be a Being.

Overall the game is outstanding, and I recommend it.

P. S. Why do they have needles in neuromods to shove stuff into my eye just to gain an ability?! Why is that a thing?! I HATE NEEDLES!"
3756,5,I bought the amiibo for Nintendo Switch game called Splatoon 2. I bought used amiibo and this box set was not available from Craigslist locally. I tossed the packaging and got the game bonus and now sits inside my large drawer with other Amiibos. Set works with Zelda and Mario games.
3757,5,Wife has her game now.  Xbox family
3758,5,my best game
3759,5,All the Lego Series Was Purchased For 4th Year Wedding ANNIVERSARY Gift Thank You!  HE Loves Them All! and I'm Learning to Play
3760,5,Bought it for a student of mine and it worked great. It was cheap in price and so far it's still working fine.
3761,5,Love This Game
3762,5,fine
3763,5,"I have looked everywhere for a controller like this for a reasonable price and got exactly what I wanted. The controller works great, it shipped on time and I couldn't be happier."
3764,5,"Got it for my son, he love it"
3765,5,perfect game
3766,5,"if you played any of the original Serious Sam games, then I highly recommend this game.

I probably love this game just because I grew up with it. But I must warn you right now, if you are into Serious FPS games, then do not pick this up unless you enjoy some humor and random events.

This bundle is definitely worth the price! And I must mention that if you are a fan of the Duke Nukem series, this game follows the same concept, but follows its own path, making it have variety."
3767,5,"I own every single Spider-Man game to date. I'm a Spider-Man nut and the moment any of these games hit the market they hit my system for some swing time. This is one of the better Spider-Man games on the market and certainly the best Beenox made Spider-Man game. There have been some big changes this time around. For example you actually have to think about which hand to use while web slinging since you can shoot webbing with your right and left hand using the right and left triggers. And attempting to shoot a webline from the wrong hand can make you fall. It also helps while turning corners to shoot with the corresponding hand. The web rush is back from the previous game which is a plus. Although I have noticed it doesn't work as well as it did in the first game. I put the first game back in my system to make sure and as it turns out the web rush system worked much better in the first Amazing Spider-Man game. Every time you'd push the web rush button in the first game it worked. It seems like half the time you push the web rush button in this new game it doesn't work. I'm glad the web rush is back, I just wish they took the time to make it work as well as it did in the first game. So what about the improvements?

Unlimited crime! Better swing mechanics! Smoother combat! A better story line! More classic villains! More than a dozen different costumes that actually effect gameplay! Stealth gameplay has been vastly improved! A nice variety in side missions! And Peter Parker missions this time! Oh, and let's not forget the fact Stan Lee makes more than just a quick cameo in this game. He plays a big role this time around and it's great! I won't spoil it for you but let me just say it is all very clever and adds lots of replay to this game.

I am thoroughly enjoying this game. I have run into a few minor bugs but nothing game breaking (which will probably get patched anyway). The ability to choose dialogue ala ""Mass Effect"" was a nice touch as well. If you are a Spider-Man fan there is no way you will not enjoy this game.

*update

I'm much further into this game and I have to say the story line is great! What they do with Kraven and Spider-Man is just fantastic. The debate they get into over whether or not they should ever take a life, and if it is ever justified is just flawless. I was not expecting this caliber of writing for a video game movie tie in. I also really enjoyed what they did with a certain serial killer in the Spider-Man universe. Normally I don't care for changes to story lines and characters from the comics but what they do with this character was very inspired. I don't want to ruin who and what they did, but let me just say the writing for this game is top notch. Best Spider-Man game story since the Ultimate Spider-Man game which was written by the great Brian M. Bendis. So that's saying a lot. You know Beenox has done this game right when, more than once, I actually thought to myself the story line in this game improved upon the story line from the movie. That's all, I just wanted to give an update.

*update 2

I've finished the game and put a lot of hours into the game after having complete it. I love swinging around New York (and replaying missions) but what is starting to drive me crazy is before every random crime it has to load. Which is weird because you can see the guys you are about to fight in real time before it loads. But any way it loads to show you a small cut scene when you arrive and then cuts to another small cut scene when you win and then has to reload the city. When in ALL other free roam Spider-Man game there is no loading to fight the random crimes and loading when you finish the random crimes. It's time consuming and annoying. It also pulls you out of the game. But worst of all is the Daily Bugle news spots they play OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER...

and over after each crime resolved. There really should be a way to turn those off. Or at least skip them the moment they start. Instead you have to watch at least half or sometimes more of each of them before the game lets you skip it. And for someone like me who plays this game non-stop for hours and hours it can get pretty annoying to have to watch those Daily Bugle news reports 1000 times.

So over all this is a great Spider-Man game (possibly the best Spider-Man game yet right along side ""Web of Shadows"") and unlike the Amazing Spider-Man game before it, this one lends itself to being played non-stop like most of the other free roam Spider-Man games because of the unlimited crime. I just wish they didn't have to load every time I wanted to do a random crime. And every time after you complete a random crime.

*update 3

Ok, last update. I've put a ton of hours into this game even after finishing it. There is lots to do after beating the game. And the swing mechanics are actually much more dynamic than how they first appear. I find myself looking for the tallest buildings to shot a web onto so I can swing around it giving me 360 degrees of movement from that one web line or holding the ""B"" button to twirl around a corner while wall running instead of jumping off when you get to a corner. The web slinging only seems shallow to those who haven't mastered them. Beenox made them easy to use but complex to master. I can now do all kinds of neat tricks while web swinging around the city that I had no idea I could do when I first started this game. Possibly the best Spider-Man game so far."
3768,5,nice
3769,5,They love it.
3770,5,Works like the original. Win 7 and 8.1.
3771,5,Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed..all ok
3772,5,Great Product
3773,5,Gifted this to my fiance who is a hug fan of the series. Received in mint condition. No problems with shipping or anything!

The lights that change color add a ton of cool factor to the keyboard. Good tactile feedback on the keys. The placement and soft touch of the keys are comparable to a more expensive Logitech keyboard.  In terms of quality, this keyboard is easily a mid-tier keyboard. It's definitely nothing to laugh at. The keyboard's selling point, its backlighting, comes in 7 different colors. You hold the Fn key and press the ScrLk key to cycle through them all. Then at the end, there' s an option that continuously cycles through all 7 colors on a timed interval, giving the keyboard a really cool look and feel to it. You can also opt to turn the backlighting off as well. IHold Fn and press PaUp/PaDn to adjust the brightness of the backlights as well.here are stands on the back of the keyboard that you can push up and down if you want your keyboard to sit on an incline. There are also 2 big red bumper arm rests on each side of the keyboard. The left one is primarily for your left hand on home row, while the right one is primarily for your right hand on the numpad. Ultimately these kinds of things all depend on the user. You can choose where to rest your hands and you can choose whether to use the stands or not. This is a pretty oversized keyboard so even users like me with big hands should have no problems whatsoever. The USB cable cord is a pretty decent braided fiber cable. You won't need to worry about it breaking, shorting out, etc. for a long time.
 I am giving thiS A 5 star review based on its current price selling point. Want to save some money and dump that money into new games yet still have a sweet keyboard? Here you go!

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. Let's keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!
I received a sample product to test and evaluate and give my unbiased feedback to you. This is my honest opinion of the product. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review."
3775,5,"This is possibly one of the nicest game collections I've ever purchased.  Everything, from the packaging down to the game content itself is top notch, obviously intended to make the fan boys drool.  I personally don't care about the collector's aspect of the game.  It's nice, but I am more interested in the upgraded controls.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Much like the Pikmin remake, the upgraded controls rejuvenate the experience.

Most of this review focuses on this product as a collector's pack or compilation since there is an abundance of good reviews on each of the individual games.  For anyone who hasn't played any of the Metroid Prime series of games, here's a really quick summary.  You play as Samus Aran, a bounty-hunter in a power suit that must save the galaxy from immense and epic danger.  THREE TIMES!  The game is played from a first-person perspective, and althought you kill a lot of Space Pirates with a variety of weapons, it is quite different from many FPS titles out there.  Exploration of the environment and discovery of clues, countless upgrades, intense platforming sections, and backtracking to find new paths are the name of the game.  In my opinion, the Metroid Prime series is possibly the only FPS title out there that really manages to get platforming right.  Almost never do the jumps feel cheap or impossible, even when they are challenging.  Combat controls are tight and responsive and I never found myself struggling with flaws in the controls.  Each of the three games play essentially the same, but the story is slightly different in each with some different weapons and item upgrades found throughout the title.

WHAT'S NEW IN THIS?
- Wii pointer controls for aiming and some limited motion controls.
- Achievement/Medal system has been added to the first two titles
- Widescreen support for the first two titles
- Minor graphical upgrades
- Metal collector's set box
- Collector's artwork
- One of the nicest and heftiest instruction manuals I've ever seen in a console game.  They don't make them like this anymore.

THE GOOD:
+++ Amazingly tight and precise controls, but more customization options would have been nice.
+++ Split-screen multi-player in Metroid Prime 2.
+++ Three of the best and most critically acclaimed Nintendo games ever made all on one disc.
+++ Amazing graphics which... well, they're really old and show their age but the artwork is stunning.
+++ At least 60+ hours of game play.

THE BAD... SORT OF
--- No online multi-player.  It really feels like the only thing missing from the game.
--- Lots of back-tracking.  It's not really that bad, but some people can't stand it.  Be warned.
--- You may have already paid for this and beat it at least once before.
--- This set proves that most developers are lazy on the Wii because the graphics on some games produced last generation mop the floor.

IS IT WORTH THE PURCHASE?
That depends on who you are.

* If you have never played any of the Metroid Prime titles and are looking for a good adventure game or a FPS title and you don't mind lots of exploration, pick this up.
* If you tried either Metroid Prime or Metroid Prime 3 - Corruption and didn't like it, I doubt you'll like it this time either.
* If you tried Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes and didn't like it or got frustrated, I recommend at least renting this one because Prime and Corruption are much more approachable than Echoes was.
* If you beat all three Metroids before and you never play through a game a second time, you may want to stay away from this title. For those who rarely replay games after beating them, the new additions are nice, but nothing except the controls are earth-shatteringly new.
* If you enjoy replaying some of your favorite games over again from time to time and you consider Metroid to be one of your favorites, the control upgrades alone are reason enough to justify the purchase.  Much like Resident Evil 4, the remake for the Wii makes this the definitive version to own.
* If you enjoyed Metroid Prime - Corruption and never played Metroid Prime 1 & 2, this game is a must buy.
* If you're a Metroid fan boy/girl, yes.  This game was made just for you.  I'd tell you to buy it, but you probably already had a copy pre-ordered months ago.  In fact, go buy two copies, keeping one sealed in the original shrink wrap inside a sealed vault.  I also recommend getting some therapy."
3776,5,Great product. Extremely durable. I can tell the travel bag will last a very long time. I'm very glad I took a chance on you guys. I use the bag every day
3777,5,Great price... pretty cool game.  Tons of DLC is available for this game now on PlayStation Network.
3778,5,"Classic SNES game, awesome soundtrack!"
3779,5,"This game offers free to play or a sub, this card makes it easy as it allows you to bypass the auto renewal so if you ever get bored you can just live and forget without the added chore of having to convince the website shes just not right for you. 10/10."
3780,5,"Came in a nice Nintendo box, so you know it's legit.
It works, can't argue with that.
It charges my new Nintendo 3DS XL just fine"
3781,5,As expected and fast delivery
3782,5,works great
3783,5,this is a great game and its a blast to play.
3784,5,THIS IS THE BEST BRAND TO GET.  WE DON'T BUY ANY OTHER BRAND OF CONTROLLER. IT MUST BE LOGITECH!  THIS IS THE ONLY BRAND THAT YOU CAN TRUST TO LAST FOR A DECENT PERIOD OF TIME.  IT IS A LOT OF FUN TO USE AND WORTH THE MONEY THAT YOU PAY FOR IT!
3785,5,the kids love this game I'll can love minecraft  you can play with the people on PC version.  So if you want your kids to build there own world online.  Great game.
3786,5,Good! I can use this to play some games that are not available on PC
3787,5,"This game is actually pretty fun. I would classify it as a very beginning RPG for kids who are ready to get into RPG's and teens or adults that can appreciate the quirky humor. The story is just as basic as it comes. You get quests to fulfill and you go about completing them. The control is entirely stylus driven and, for the most part, works pretty well. There are times when I would have preferred to have button controls as well but I did not find it so frustrating that it impacted game play (although I do need to point out it *is* noticeable).

Where this game shines is in gameplay and sound. The battles are quite funny and the music is truly amazing. It is definitely more kind of hip-hop/rock and overall its got some really great beats. The animations of the characters in battle are quite funny. They would get old if you weren't allowed to switch out the characters in your party but you can. The rock/paper/scissors battle combat system is as basic as it comes and standard for a lot of RPG's or action game. Zubo goes the extra mile and puts a + or - on characters so you can tell which of your party will ""beat"" the enemy--no guesswork needed. Want to do the most damage--use the character that has the +. Adults may find this a bit juvenille but I didn't mind at all.

In terms of the rhythm type stylus action--that was just o.k. You are not doing it to the beat of the music (EA--next time if you throw this in make sure it relates to your music) but it never gets to a point where it is so frustrating--I'm a little less than 1/2 way through and I'm having no problem getting the hang of it.

In terms of game length it seems fine. I've only played about 5-6 hours. If I remain on track that means I could complete in as few as 13-18 hours (assuming I take the same pace) and that's not too much for someone just getting into RPG. Please keep in mind folks this is NOT Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy and it really doesn't set out to be so that's o.k.

I am finding it a very enjoyable funny game that does not take a ton of concentration or planning (like those others I mention). The music is a blast, characters are pretty funny (even if they all look pretty similar), and I'm motivated to continue.

Verdict: Funny game, good music, enjoyable. It's not deep or engrossing but I'm happy to go forth and complete the quests and have a good time doing it. I should note that this is NOT the same type of 5 star rating I'd give to something like TWEWY---but that would be an apples to oranges comparison. I'd probably actually give it about 4.5 stars--but I want to support new IP's---so I'm giving it a 5."
3788,5,Thanks
3789,5,Single player mode is amazing. The difficulty increase is at the right pase. Tons of weapons that you can use. Every level felt challenging but never too hard.
3790,5,This is a good wire very very good i bought the sony wire for 20$ did not work at all i used this one work great buying this wire is better than spending 20$ on a sony plastation 3 hd wire
3791,5,"Previously I've bought a Wii Remote Plus from a somewhat sketchy seller and, while it worked, this was a much easier piece to use. The extra inch or so adapter on the end is slightly funky but I don't really notice it when playing and it's a very cost effective way to upgrade old Wii Remotes for newer games, specifically Wii U titles. Comes with the extended rubber case which is awkward but not unreasonable, and you can just slip the adapter out if you want."
3792,5,Ok
3793,5,"I don't get all the hate... You can't judge this game poorly because it's not Modern Warfare. It's not, get over it and play it how it's been developed. It's a pretty good installment in mt opinion. The maps are small but it has decent sight lines that can be used for long rifles too. The story is well done and it doesn't feel like you're fighting endless waves of bots like BO3. You're back to spilling blood."
3794,5,"First off, I don't like going to the gym.  The sweaty used machines, the gym rats giving normal people their looks of pity, I can do without.

After playing Wii Fit for just an hour, I am sweating as much as I would be at a gym.  A gym is $80 a month.  Wii Fit is $100 once.  Hmm, what a hard decision!

The balance board is a great idea, but I'm not sure how accurate it is with the weight thing.  Wii Fit doesn't know the difference between muscle and fat.  So if you're 6'3 215 with decent muscle tone, it'll call you overweight, and tell you that you need to lose 30 pounds.  Don't take this information to heart.  Shoot for losing SOME weight, any number, and don't worry about what it says you should lose.  Any off is good.

The presentation itself is cute.  I like the little ""whoa"" the balance board gives when you get on.  Nice little joke, there.

I don't like that you have to work to unlock features.  Then again, if all features were available to me, I probably wouldn't use ones I didn't like more than once.  So, I guess that's the reason.

I don't see a person getting ""buff"" with this system.  It is not meant for weight training, or building muscle mass.  However, it is excellent cardio, and the yoga/balance exercises are neat too.  Considering how many of us really need to get up off the couch (like me) it is an amazing system to start some sort of fitness regimen with."
3795,5,My son is a Sonic enthusiast and this edition where he can become wheredog only heightens his enjoyment of Sonic and keeps him waiting for another edition of Sonic.
3796,5,My kids love this game. They can build many habitats and learn what animals like what.
3797,5,very good
3798,5,Simply amazing. One of the best I've ever played... even though I grew up playing the old ones the new 3d format never bothered me because the game was simply just so well done. Game is waaay to easy though. I would recommend everytime.
3799,5,"This inexpensive case is much better than others that cost much more.

For $9 you get a case that can hold a PSP, at least four UMDs (one in the system), a spare battery, ear buds and a few memory cards. Watch for the rivet issue discussed here. I simply stuck a piece of foam on top of it and the issue was rectified. The only other con is the weak looking zipper but what do you expect for the price? Buy two."
3800,5,"**As a special side note please be aware that ONLY the PlayStation 3 version includes all the content on 1 disc, the 360 version of Gold Edition comes with a download voucher, which requires High speed internet access and a Xbox Live account to download the extra content without those you can not access the extra content on Xbox 360**

This game is essentially a HD version of RE4 with a co-op (2 player) online or AI (computer controlled) partner. This game is best with another player controlling Sheva but its perfectly fine as a single player game too. This Gold Edition re-release includes the following:

Lost in Nightmares bonus mission

Desperate Escape bonus mission

Mercenaries Reunion battle game

Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers and Excella Gionne as playable characters in Mercenaries Reunion mode.

4 new costumes (2 for Sheva and 2 for Chris)

Extra in game figures to collect

Online player vs player Versus mode.

Overall this is a very good deal for those that passed on the original release."
3801,5,"A bit confusing to assemble, but these make the game much more fun to play on the drums.
The assembly instructions in the book that come with this leave a lot to be desired. Look it up on YouTube. Much easier."
3802,5,Pretty cool. I got my room mate a pair (in blue) and he loves them. It would be cool if the lights flashed to music and sound but that is okay.
3803,5,still using it
3804,5,"I havent' actually played this yet. I JUST received it actually, but I wanted to let people know in as many spots as I could so....

I'd like to point out this info (a 1 GB update taking up memory card space) is false now in case anyone is thinking about getting this game. Yes the first two updates were both 1 GB (and apparently the second overwrote the first)..... however I JUST got the game today. There is now a third update, and it is the ONLY one you'll download. It's only 385 MB or so. And from what I've read elsewhere it will DELETE 800 MB of the other 1 GB update, freeing up space.

So..... for those that already had it and have the huge update... update the game again. You should get about 800MB back. For those on the fence about even getting this game cause of a giant update, dont' worry about it anymore. You'll only download ~380 MB. And the game card itself is 200 MB. My guess is they just shipped new batches of the game with most of the data on the card updated from those giant updates. Either that or they found a way to compress all that data into 380 MB and overwrote the previous update.... Idk...... but it's only ~580 MB in total now."
3805,5,"No games provide as much fun and ease of play as the Lego games.  There are many challenges, but none of them require great gaming skills, so they are fit for the very young or the very old.  5 year olds play this game at our house and 70 year olds take whatever turn is available.  Go Indiana Jones!"
3806,5,"Project Revolution. That was the title given to the Wii before ""Wii"" was revealed to a mocking world. But it would leave other consoles of that generation in the dust sales-wise (though I love my PS3 to death). The controls would be considered revolutionary, but we all know that when the console released they weren't exactly what we thought they'd be. The MotionPlus rectified the issue, but few games of merit utilized the feature.
Upon release, it was seen as a party machine, a new form of the karaoke machine, if you will. Many members of my extended family had one, and plenty of friends had one too. My first experiences with the Wii as a gaming machine rather than a party machine were from a roommate's loaner. Because the Wii was backwards compatible with GCN discs, I got to play the NES Zelda and Ocarina of Time to completion for the first time (thanks to the Collector's Edition). Galaxy was the first title on the Wii I played in full, and it took my breath away. I was hooked.
Of course, like many, I was confused as all heck when I found out the remote didn't generate 1:1 accuracy, especially when I played the Wii version of Twilight Princess for the first time, but I got on just fine. In fact, most of the games I played I ended up using another controller, like the GameCube or Classic Controller (and Pro when it was released). Only for games that required it, like both Galaxys, did I use the remote and nunchuk combination.

At that time, I was a senior in undergrad, and the years prior I never let my gaming interfere with my education. But the Wii and DS destroyed that rule. After graduation, because I couldn't get a full-time job right away, I had to settle and wait for a while before buying my own console. It's funny, though, as I already owned Twilight Princess (Wii version) and Brawl for quite some time.
Finally, my sister realized she wanted to get one too and we split the cost in July of 2008. This was when the Wii, over a year after its release, was still pretty popular and hard to find. We had to call our local Target almost every morning for two weeks before we landed one. I was eager to get one as I never really owned a Nintendo console as a kid, having only a hand-me-down NES which rarely worked. I was impatient to play all the Ninty games I missed out on.

It's a fantastic system with a buffet of a library able to satiate any gamer's fancy. The gamer like me? There's Zelda, Metroid, and even the ""kiddy"" games like Mario. It's because of the Wii and its backward-capabilities that I'm a huge Mario/Nintendo fan, and Zelda has become one of my favorite game series--alongside Final Fantasy (pre-XII). Also, when I purchased it, I still lived at home and my kid sister and I had a blast playing games together. In fact, she's currently borrowing it right now and plays hours on end of Mario Kart and Wii Sports.

One would think that with the Wii U available it may be a bit hard to sell the Wii, but that'd be wrong. The Wii is still priced competitively, and is probably the biggest bang for your buck if you want to play first-party titles. I have a setup of the Wii and PS3 and couldn't be happier.
Of course, even from its launch, the Wii isn't known for its powerful graphics. Blame the hardware limitations; even if you get component cables it won't look that much better. In fact, on a flat screen LED or LCD TV it looks actually *worse* with component cables because there's so much jaggedness. I remember plugging in component cables for the first time on my new (at the time) Toshiba LCD and was appalled when playing New Super Mario Bros. Wii. I had upgraded my tube from an old 32"" CRT Zenith and the Wii looked better on that with composite cables. But you always can go the way of the Dolphin.

So, in 2014, is getting the Wii worth it? It depends; how caught up are you with Nintendo games? Sure, you can get a Wii U, but there aren't as many games on it as there are on the Wii if you get just the older, cheaper console, especially if you get the older GCN-compatible model. I invested heavily in peripherals, so that made my gaming experience much more enjoyable and competitive.
I used the white GameCube controller and WaveBird for Brawl and Mario Kart, as well of course for any GameCube titles. For the Virtual Console I used primarily the Classic Controller and its variant the Pro, and I imported the Club Nintendo of Japan Super Famicom controller for the Wii. For fighting games and arcade titles that used a digital signal rather than analog (e.g., Tatsunoko vs. Capcom), I used Hori's arcade stick. So my experience may or may not differ from yours.

Even today I think it's worth getting. There's at least ten solid titles for any kind of gamer. Sure, there aren't many M-rated games on the platform, but that's not why I got it. I consider myself a gamer whose sole intention is to enjoy every and all kinds of games available; I'm not a fanboy of any brand, and am open to try any games from the `70s and `80s to today. That's why I got a Nintendo console: to play all the games available on it that I missed in the years they were released. I can enjoy arcade and NES titles as well as the limited number of N64 emulated classics (I say ""emulated"" because it's not the same thing as playing on the good ol' N64). I have a 3DS now and play that more often than the Wii, but I still have a number of games I haven't completed to which I plan on returning; once those are out of the way, the Wii U will be my next purchase.

Thus ends my review. I guess this isn't as much a review as it is a catalog of my experiences with the console the past half-decade, but I couldn't write it any other way."
3807,5,Totally
3808,5,"Having played electronic baseball games from the days of Coleco and Matel with LEDs, various baseball adaptations from the Super Nintendo, Genesis, Dreamcast, Playstations, and XBox 360.  I have been amazed at the realism that this game has.  From the various stances and batting styles, to the actual execution of fielding, pitching and batting, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Teams can be managed or actually played.  The Home Run Derby as a pitcher or batter, fielding, pitching or batting skills can be practiced in subsets of the games.  Graphics, sound effects and physics are excellent.  The interface with the controls are responsive.  Replay factor is high.  I find this game to be one of my favorites in the library of Playstation Vita titles.  It would be nice to see Classic Teams from the beginning of the rich history in Major League Baseball.

I look forward to future versions which can only get better."
3809,5,Even tho this game was intended for little kids is loads of fun I kept playing it over and over again trying to complete all the mission.
3810,5,That game is very usefull for mys boys. Thanks for send to me quickly. I`m from Venezuela!
3811,5,all good
3812,5,Works as expected. Recommended since you can't find too much color variety in-stores.
3813,5,Decent inexpensive mechanical keyboard.
3814,5,"The goal is simple: capture the beat and you will advance through dozens of brief mini-games in this addictive rhythm game on the Nintendo DS.

Originally released in 2009,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rhythm-Heaven/dp/B001P1ZE68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rhythm Heaven</a>&nbsp;holds up well, partially because it relies less on graphics and more on catchy tunes and clever gameplay. The game requires you to hold your DS sideways like a book as you tap and slide the stylus to keep the rhythm. Each of the mini-games last no more than one minute, which makes Rhythm Heaven a great distraction if you are sitting in a waiting room, looking to kill time.

The game tests your musical abilities as you flick, slap, and zap your way through ""10 sets of rhythm games with 5 sub-rhythm games per set,"" according to the description on Wikipedia. No one in our household has come close to finishing the game - you have to unlock one mini-game to reach the next - and everyone has tried! (We pass the DS around the family until one of us succeeds in unlocking a tricky mini-game.)

In summary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rhythm-Heaven/dp/B001P1ZE68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rhythm Heaven</a>&nbsp;is an excellent game because of its catchy music, addictive gameplay and appeal to all ages.

Rating: Five stars

3815,5,"Ok let me start off by saying that Final Fantasy 6 or 3 here in the U.S. is the best ever.  This game is tied for 2nd place with Final Fantasy 4 or 2 in the U.S.
 Theres just so much in this game that i love.  The artwork has gone back to the series roots.  FF7 and 8 had too much a futuristic look to them.  This game get back to the hardcore fantasy world with knights, castles, wizards, and swords.  The cinematic scenes are awesome as well.  But for hardcore RPGers like myself the most important aspects are story, and gameplay.  The storyline is strong and makes a great deal of sense.  You actually care about the characters you are playing with, unlike FF8.  The battle system has gone back to the series roots as well.  There are now 4 characters on screen during battle, unlike 3 in FF7 and 8.  Each characters plays differently and has unique abilities, unlike FF8 when everyone was the same.  There is actually armor, experience points and money in this game and they mean something, again unlike FF8.
 Some argue that this game is meant for children.....if they did they obviously haven't played it.  This game can get tough at times, and even the most hardcore RPGer will see the Game Over screen a few times.  This game is SOOOOO deep.  Unless you cheat and use a guide then this game has major replay value for someone who likes to find everything.  I could have done without the silly card game, but i guess some people just love collecting stuff.
In conclusion if you love the Final Fantasy series, but are in doubt about buying another one after the debacle that was Final Fantasy 8, trust me buy this game and you won't be disappointed"
3816,5,Not the best game I've ever played but definitely fun. Way overrated but I enjoyed it.
3817,5,"My system is in my bedroom and sometimes my wife goes to bed early (she has to get up for work at 5AM). Lights keep her awake sometimes so this LED lighted keyboard is a huge bonus. Also the keys are quiet so my typing doesn't bother her either. If I have anything bad to say about it, it is that it does not come with a manual to explain how to use all the gaming features, i.e. all the G1 thru G6 keys, M1 thru M3, MR, etc. The quality of the build is excellent -- the keyboard is solid. My latest rig is lit up all in Blue LED's, this keyboard is green, but considering it is the exact same keyboard as the blue LED version at less than half the price, it was a no brainer, after all, it is still just a keyboard. Serious gamers are using controllers or joystick anyway. My purpose was to be able to see it in the dark, for it to be quiet at night and not cost me an arm. Since I game sometimes late into the night (I am nocternal), and my wife by occupation is not (She's a morning person). Keeping peace was key. Mission accomplished"
3818,5,Loved it. Was in very excellent condition and no problems loading it. Played wonderfully. Nice addition to my sims 2 game. Thanks all so much.
3819,5,grandson loved it.
3820,5,"You have to be a real jerk to not like this game. It has smooth and good graphics, craploads of weapons, enjoyable mini-games, an awesome geomode(or whatever it's called), and lots to do and explore. The bad stuff is that the dungeon exploring starts becoming a chore after a while, the characters you get in your party don't have any real use other than puzzle-solving, the controls need work(the square button uses an item, X uses weapons, and sometimes I accedentally press square!), worst of all, it's very, very frustratingly hard. Overall, this is a must-play for anyone who likes RPGs."
3821,5,"this is absolutely amazing, the gravity and real world driving simulator is incredible, these cars act like they are real and the gameplay is very cool.
BUY IT NOW!"
3822,5,Excellent game based on the Beetlejuice movie that would eventually spawn into toys and cartoon shows. Originally I have the game up to my middle school days and traded games with classmates for other games.
3823,5,"I Have Nothing Negative To Say..Everything Was Perfect! Packaging Was Perfect, The Game Is Awesome To Play, And All The Codes Worked Perfectly :) Great Buy, Seeing How Its More $$ And +Tax Everywhere Else :D"
3824,5,Great service and great product...
3825,5,"This game is fun and fits right in with the other tow. I heard a lot of griping about the end, but I didn't mind it so much. Graphics are good and even thought it gets a little repetitive its fun to play. The only major complaint I have is that it was about 30% shorter than I thought it should be,"
3826,5,My Kids Love it!
3827,5,Great...
3828,5,Interesting premise for a game.
3829,5,"It's cool, you kill bugs"
3830,5,"This was the first Lego game I saw (although not the first I played). A friend was playing it at our house and it looked really fun, so I made a note to buy it when I got the chance. Another xbox we bought came with Lego Batman which got me hooked on the Franchise. This game is a lot of fun, challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so easy that I just flew through it. I'm a completionist (have to get all of those achievements!) so it definitely provided enough hours of play time for me! Now that my oldest is starting to play Lego games, I still have this and will allow him to play it if he wants. I'm sure there will be parts that he may need my help (he is five), but for the most part, I think this would be easy enough for youngish children too."
3831,5,"A great installment in the Pokemon series, fantastic new storyline and Pokemon and wonderful graphics."
3832,5,i absolutely love this game. installation through amazon's proprietary whatever installer was easy enough. i'll keep this game installed forever.
3833,5,Very fun game.
3834,5,i love it
3835,5,"The best 3DS game I have ever played. Great story, excellent gameplay. If you want to try an outstanding Strategy RPG, this is your game."
3836,5,"I did not play any of the BlazBlue games before, man was I missing out. This for me is what a really fun fighting game is all about. If you like fighting games you need to pick this up, it takes some time to get the hang of it but that come with every game you play."
3837,5,I like this! It works great but hard to come by since there are no more games coming out for it som=nce the Switch
3838,5,"Guns, bullets, and explosions. The barebones essentials to make almost any FPS great.

I have grown extremely tired of the Call of Duty/ battlefield/ Halo debates. Gamers have become quite cruel to each other when it comes to these games and they seem to worship these games like they are their holy grail of shooters. I myself miss the days when a new FPS was coming out and EVERYONE was excited about it. There were no flame wars about which game was better or whose graphics were just a bit better, people just wanted to have a good time. Isn't that what games are supposed to be about? I guess I am just a wishful thinker, I better get to the point here.

Bodycount throws everything about modern day shooters out the window and I am 100% ok with that idea. This game is all about pure arcade action! Think about the game as a modern day Metal Slug and you will understand what the guys at Codemasters were trying to achieve. Even the ammo and intel pickups you recieve from killing baddies make arcade-like sounds when you pick them up. The game has next to no story, but thats fine with me, in fact im GLAD there isn't a shoddy attempt at a ""story"" because the most popular FPS games these days have poor excuses for stories anyway. At least codemasters had the dignity to just focus mainly on the gunplay and not waste their time on a story that no one would care about, I play most FPS games for the gameplay only ( except for a few good ones like bioshock, half-life,etc. )

The graphics are good, they are no Crysis 2, but they get the job done and the game is still very enjoyable. Guns looks great and sound great too. There are plenty of explosions and it will be hard for you to run out of ammo. When you kill baddies they drop orbs that fill your ammo and your special skill slots. Skills include, explosive bullets and even an airstrike! Just know that this game was not aiming for much realism and you will have a great time!

Here is where people are gonna whine about this game, when you ""aim down the sites"" of your gun, the camera jusy zooms in on your target reticule...just like the old days of shooters! Remember when ""iron sites"" didn't exist? Games like Timesplitters 2 and Black were fantastic games, and they didn't have iron sights. It may take awhile to get used to, but this aiming system is still awesome. Which brings me to point #2. When you pull the left trigger all the way, you can't move your character withthe left stick anymore. You go into a manual cover mode where you can dodge in any direction, which is quite awesome and inventive. Do not fret though, you can still aim and move if you only pull the left trigger half way down. Its a new control scheme and its nice to see something new.

Basically, there is not much more to this game that I can tell you about. There isn't much of a story and the gameplay is solid. The guns look and feel great, and the action never stops. If you are looking for a game that embraces the FPS style of yesteryear, then do not overlook Bodycount!

New: I see the big time reviewers already bashing this game for lack of story and simple multiplayer. Even Official Xbox Magazine said that you can only strafe while aiming down the sites, obviously they didn't take the time to even play the game because you can move around with the trigger half pulled. Do not let the big time reviewers persuade you, play this game for yourself."
3839,5,"Halo 4 gets 5 stars on its own, but I am going to write about the extra content.  You get a download copy of Forward unto Dawn, edited into a movie - AMAZING.  You also get the next 3 upcoming map packs, which is a good deal.  There is some upgraded in game armor and such as well.  Unquestionably worth the extra cash if you are into halo."
3840,5,Great product.
3841,5,"Then u will not be disappointed. I love my pink 3ds. All of the 3ds colors are pretty, but pink is feminine. The 3ds is wayyyy more sophisticated than the dsi. Swapnote, video, Netflix, 3d... An amazing device, whether it's pink, or not (pink is an added bonus)."
3842,5,it works fantastically and arrived very promptly :)
3843,5,"Singstar has been around for a while and they seem to have fine tuned it pretty well. You can sing along with the artist or you can turn their vocals off. Keep in mind this is not s trainer or anything, it's a game, so even when I croak, occasionally, I get a good score. 25 songs included on disc (listed at end of review).

****** THIS GAME REQUIRES MICROPHONE ACCESSORIES ******
There are both wired and wireless mics available. The wired will run you about $25 US. Wireless is a little more. There are packages that come with the Singstar discs and the wired mics for about 30 bucks.

Pros:
-there are 2 player and party options
-actual music videos for the songs
-video quality is usually pretty clear (i guess as clear as an ABBA video could be)
-Singstar software allows you to purchase more songs and other artists online so you can expand the game

Cons:
-additional songs are $1.49 US each.

ABBA GAME song list:
-Chiquitita
-Dancing Queen
-Does Your Mother Know
-Fernando
-Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie
-Happy New Year
-Head over heals
-I do. I do, I do, I do
-Knowing me, Knowing you
-Mama Mia
-Money Money Money
-One of us
-Ring Ring
-SOS
-Summer Night City
-Super Trooper
-Take a Chance on me
-Thank you for the music
-The day before you came
-The name of the game
-The winner takes it all
-Under Attack
-Voulez-Vous
-Waterloo
-When All Is Said and Done"
3844,5,Lots of fun for entire family...
3845,5,Got this for my boyfriend. I also got him the keyboard. He needed a new set up and I couldn't afford the high dollar products form other companies. So i tried this with the mechanical keyboard from Redragon. He loves it. The quality is better than Razor in my opinion and he used it every day. I got it in January 2017 and its still like its brand new. It also came in a nice storage box as well so great packaging. You cant change the colors on it but not a big deal. His whole set up is red so it worked out. Would recommend this to anyone needing a gaming mouse or a mouse in general.
3846,5,"Great game system. This is perfect for my 7 year old. He wanted the DSi but was not going to be able to play all his older gameboy games on it, so he opted for this model and loves it. We paired it up with the Nerf cover case..... now totally indestructible."
3847,5,"A lil awkward at first since its a gel grip but you'll get use to it, your gaming experience gets better, and it protects that crappy ps4 grips that it comes stock with. Which peels off very easily after heavey use"
3848,5,Great fun.
3849,5,LOVE IT
3850,5,Much more memory...should have went with the 1019 to begin with...
3851,5,scored this for 1 cent and it gives me a crystal clear picture and great audio thumbs up all around
3852,5,great story modes forgot some of the episodes that played on their brought back memeories even tho I'm 36yrs old I still remember some of the Hulk Hogan moments on their
3853,5,The item is great.
3854,5,"I have an ATI card and had some problems running the game.  But the folks at CivFanatics.com have a screen-by-screen ""how to update your drivers and get the game to run"" section that is easy to follow.  After updating all the things I should've updated anyway, the game runs fine.

The game itself is great fun.  It can be played on a variety of difficulty levels, so everyone can win.  It got rid a lot of the tedium that plagued the end-game of Civ III (and Civ II and Civ).  There are nice graphics, and the music is WONDERFUL.

If you have any problems, contact the people at CiVFanatics.com.  They will be glad to help.  In addition, the site continually posts tips and hints for improving your play."
3855,5,I had the Xbox 360 version and loved it so automatically when I got my Xbox One this was a must. Battery life is pretty good. I've had no issues with the charge base. The design is not like the Xbox 360's version. You have to place the controller in and adjust it if you see the front light up letting you know the controller's charging. Other than that its a good product for all gamers.
3856,5,Great gaming experience as you can change your Sims from human to werewolf and everything in-between
3857,5,"Without going beyond the fact that this is a controller, it is a controller.

That being said, I find the updates made to the X1 controller to be great!  Tactile feedback in the triggers makes for a more exciting FPS solution.  The controller will last a good 30 hours or so on batteries, but I highly recommend getting the charge and play kit.  So far I have had 0 issues with my controller, and the plug in and update option is amazing."
3858,5,"Yeah, this is a little late, and The Sims 3 is already full-blown, but hey, there may be some of you out there still unfamiliar with the franchise. Believe me, you are missing out.

This game was a superb advancement of the original ""Sims,"" a game in which you, the player, are quite literally a deity controlling the lives of your hapless sims, or simulated people. And yes, with all the mods and skins available, you are a god.

A more powerful game engine enables much more beautiful character models, 100% customizable character appearances, and 3-dimensional view of the game world. This game is everything the original ""Sims"" should have been, and more. But of course, without the original, we would never have had this one.

Excellent work, Mr. Wright. I salute thee.

Recommended for all control freaks and anyone with a god complex."
3859,5,"Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos."
3860,5,"Grab yourself a tasty beverage, sit back and relax while reading my review of the Japanese Import Neon Orange Sony PlayStation Vita Slim (PCH-2000).

Pros:
-Build quality is phenomenal! The unit feels sturdy in your hands and has just enough weight on the handheld to not feel ""cheap and flimsy"" like some may think, due to the systems noticeable weight reduction as well as overall thickness. The neon orange color looks amazing in person and commands attention of onlookers around you when you play your PS Vita in public. It screams ""I am a gamer!"" I even had a few folks ask me ""What new phone is that?!"" They thought it was some sort of new hot phone on the market apparently. The buttons on the unit feel more tactile and responsive as well as the ""select and start"" buttons are far easier to press now that they are more protruding from the system vs the same button layout on the older PS Vita original launch model which were almost flush with the system face. The notification lights have been removed from the ""PlayStation"" button and instead are now two LED indicators on the top of the system near the game port. One always stays lit green while the system is running on a full battery, and turns orange when charging. The other flashes blue intermittently if a notification is received while you are away from the home screen and in an app. The reduced size of the rear touch pad is awesome! More room on the back of the system to rest your fingers with far less accidental activation of rear touch pad commands in games that use the rear touch pad as a control method. For gamers like myself with much larger hands? (I wear a 2XL glove size) this is a most welcome upgrade. Expect longer hours of gaming time as well since the this new PS Vita Slim has been reduced in size and is substantially lighter in weight and easier to hold for longer periods of time.

-Charging and Battery Life: This new slim model PS Vita now features a Micro-B USB charging and data port at the bottom of the system instead of the proprietary charging and data port of the older original PS Vita model. Charging times from a low battery vary, but here are some estimates based on my testing. Charging from a USB 2.0 port on a PS3 game console takes around 4 hours. Charging from a USB 3.0 port on a PS4 game console takes around 2.5 hours. Charging from the included wall charger takes around 2 hours. Again, those estimates are from my testing and your actual mileage may vary. You can also charge the system from a desktop or laptop computer's USB port, a powered USB Hub, or USB portable battery bank. This new PS Vita system doesn't appear to be very picky on the power source of your choice, just as long as it's USB and outputs at 5v and 500mah or greater. The system takes advantage of ""Smart Charging"" power negotiation and can accept charging at up to 5v and 2000mah for a more rapid and less time consuming charge. This rapid charging does not cause the system to get hot, nor very warm for that matter and is perfectly safe for the handheld. This new PS Vita Slim also makes an extra 1 to 2 hours of useable battery life while playing games on the system over the older original model. (Pro Tip: Switch off ""Use Wi-Fi in power save mode"" in the power options to increase wireless transfer speeds, but take a small dip on battery life, which is negligible at best. The wireless transfer performance increase is far worth it, in my opinion.) The new LCD screen on the device doesn't display colors quite as beautiful and natural as the OLED screen of the original model, but in all fairness, for the amount of energy savings the LCD screen saves and adds to game time from battery? It's a worthy trade off in my opinion. Also, if you've never seen the original launch model PS Vita in action, you won't even notice the quality loss difference from OLED to LCD. Less contrast and color saturation on the LCD is all, but again, the additional added gaming time from battery makes the LCD panel worth it!

-Game Library: This PS Vita slim unit as well as ALL PS Vita handheld systems in general are region-free in regards to game card and PSN digital library compatibility. This system plays ANY game from ANY country, no matter the language barrier. (Pro Tip: Asia (Hong Kong) ""English"" physical game card releases are more often than not fully localized for the English language in regards to subtitles, menus, and sometimes even spoken language in games. Consider ordering these titles to pad out your game library with physical game cards if that's more so your style vs digital downloaded games. A good source to acquire these games is from Play-Asia or even from Amazon. Limited Run Games is also another company to look into for physical PS Vita game cart releases of downloadable digital only titles from the PlayStation Store)

-Community: For ALL things PlayStation and PS Vita, check out the following websites; ""Kinda Funny"" (PS I Love You XOXO) with Greg Miller and Colin Moriarty as well as ""PSNation"" with Glenn Percival and Josh Langford. They are the kingpins within the PlayStation community IMO. Both the site's staff and community at those websites are very knowledgeable, intelligent, and are PlayStation and PS Vita lovers, fans, and enthusiasts. At these websites and their respective podcasts, you'll find tremendous love and support for the PS Vita handheld and all things PlayStation. Not even on the official Sony PlayStation blog or website will you find this level of love, dedication, and commitment to the PlayStation and PS Vita.

Cons:
-System Storage Memory: The system only has 1GB internal flash nand memory useable by the end user for save games, game patches, and downloads. My advice? Completely disregard this ridiculous low amount of memory and purchase a PS Vita memory card at a larger capacity ASAP! (Note: Installing a memory card into the PS Vita will disable the 1GB built in system storage memory and that memory will no longer be accessible by the end user. You are given the option to transfer all of your content from the 1GB storage to your memory card, so there is no need for a backup/restore procedure upon initial storage memory upgrade of your handheld) Unfortunately that is another con to be noted. PS Vita memory cards are crazy expensive beings that they are Sony proprietary technology. So be ready to open up your wallet again.

-LCD Screen Display: The screen is definitely large and high enough quality to display games in near HD quality, but the resolution is only qHD at 960x544p and 220 ppi. Which isn't the worse image quality on a 5 inch 16:9 LCD panel, but is definitely worth noting the visual dip in quality vs. screens we are use to looking at daily on our smartphones. Overall brightness is another issue with the LCD screen on the PS Vita Slim. Is the system playable outdoors in daylight? Forget about it! The screen might as well be a mirror. Okay, so what about on a cloudy overcast day or playing outdoors in the shade? Nope! Still not happening. The screen not only doesn't get very bright on the highest brightness setting to begin with, but brightness is actually forced down by the system's firmware / game software to dim to around 80% brightness level when you start most games on your handheld. To sum it up, this system can't be played outdoors in the daylight, plain and simple. A very unfortunate situation for sure.

Other Thoughts: Beings this system is a Japanese import. The ""X"" and ""O"" buttons are inverted for accept and cancel commands vs button command configuration on a NTSC: US/CAN (Region 1) PS Vita system. This inversion typically only applies to system level commands and doesn't effect game controls while playing in game for most games. The system's initial language is in Japanese by default, so upon first boot or fresh set-up / system restore, you will have to scroll all the way up towards the top of the language list to select ""English"" or whatever language you prefer.

Conclusion: By in large, I highly recommend the purchase of this handheld gaming device. Whether you are a PlayStation fan or you are just looking for a portable handheld that has graphics and performance nearly on par with a PlayStation 3 game console and has an amazing game library of several hundred PS Vita games to choose from. (Not failing to mention even backwards compatibility with several hundred PSP and PSone video games) There are really amazing, high quality, and AAA production games to choose from as well on the PS Vita. There are virtually no shovelware and low quality ""free to play"" game titles like you will find on your smartphone's App Store today.

[Overall Review Score: 4.5/5]"
3861,5,Good
3862,5,"Great game.  Just like the other Sim Cities, only improved graphics and control."
3863,5,"Fits like a glove, can't even notice it after putting it on."
3864,5,"This is the second game in the Legend of Spyro trilogy and is difficult, though not as hard as the third one. It still focuses on combat using attacks and elemental powers, but there are more bosses, and the enemies are harder to defeat. In this game, Spyro can temporarily stop time to slow down opponents and get the upper hand. The elements usable are fire, ice, earth, and electricity. The second attacks for these moves have drastically changed, but are just as useful. Health and breath bars can be increased with masks obtainable in the game, and another elemental power is available if you defeat the game. In the bonus features, artwork and five specialized fights are availabe when meeting certain conditions. All previous characters are in the game, plus a new character called the Chronicler. There is more of a variety of enemies and bosses. The graphics are very good. This game may dissapoint the old Spyro series fans, but anyone who likes a good storyline and tough battles will probably like this game. It recommended that you use the classic controller, not the Wii remote and nunchuk. Note: a movie will come out in theaters on April 10 of 2010 about the previous installment unless it is delayed."
3865,5,This game is super dope!
3866,5,Good  product
3867,5,"This video game was ordered as a bundle created by my fiancee and myself. We are both huge fans of video games, and all of the games ordered on Amazon arrived on time and in brand new condition. We are very satisfied with the games, and continue to enjoy playing them even a year after their original purchase!"
3868,5,excelente producto!!!!
3869,5,Thanks!
3870,5,A+!
3871,5,good as expected.
3872,5,The wife loves it
3873,5,Came in great time and works prefect. What more could you ask???
3874,5,Nice game
3875,5,Pure Awesomeness.  Only wish my Forza 5 cars would carry over.
3876,5,Great
3877,5,"This game is the best Ive played so far, it is so fun,you get to do fun missions and ride motor bikes and trash machines( mostly yours, hes always destoring Q's gadgets he gives him )and use remote spiders and detonate them, and use sleeper darts, and dart guns and gernades disguised as coins. Me and my cousin like to play two player coop, and beat people up on 3 or 4 player deathmatch( We usually gang up on people and blow them up and down and all around, and we electrify them and beat them up to death with crowbars and throw magic lamps and pipes and candles at them. This game is great."
3878,5,Perfect
3879,5,"Metal Slug Anthology brings all the Metal Slug fun from the arcade directly to the PS2! If you haven't played Metal Slug before, it's basically a run-and-gun shooter game.
PROS - It remains true to the run-and-gun formula, and retains the arcade feel (except that you have unlimited continues: no more running to get more tokens to continue playing!). The graphics suit it well, and the different scenarios are different throughout each stage.
CONS - It may take a little bit longer than expected to load stages. Once I waited for 10 seconds for the next stage to load, but it doesn't happen all the time.

Overall, this game is recommended for those seeking a pick-up-and-play experience, but not enough time to dedicate hours to a single game."
3880,5,I wait until it come down to $30 or $40.
3881,5,it is a great game for anyone who want  to play a the godfather 2 pc video game on of the best
3882,5,"This Product, Works Perfectly, On My Retron 1 Game System, As Long As You Flip It, And The Famicom Game, Backwards."
3883,5,"Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series. Brings back a lot of good memories. I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own. This sequal is too good to miss out on. Buy it before it's gone for good."
3884,5,"This game is aimed towards a younger audience. That much is a given. What you probably don't know however is that older people such as myself love this game! Yoshis story succeeded in bringing the world an original fun game with amazing graphics. Yes you do eat your enemies, but hey if they're tasty..........anyway yea. Get this game for your own good and find out for yourself how much fun it is! You won't regret it!"
3885,5,"I never played any of the Gears games and was not expecting to like it but when I saw Gears 1 tru 4 on EBay for $15 I decided to give it a try.  I played all 4 games and liked them all okay but really liked Gears 3 and 4.  I thought those were great.  The stories, graphics and gameplay mechanics were very good.  The stories were somewhat short but I like short games.  I also appreciated the different gameplay choices.  Im 70 and my reactions aren't what they were when I was younger so I play most games on Easy.  Some games on Easy are about the same as Hard and there have been a few I did not finish.  This one, while challenging, was easy enough almost everyone can get through the game.  I hope they continue making the Gears games.  I found them as good, if not better, than the COD games."
3886,5,It ok
3887,5,"We are seniors, and my wife and I both enjoy this game.  The demo doesn't show the unlocked games.  My favorite right now is the tightrope walk. The balance games and aerobics are fun.  The strength training looks like a workout, and we haven't done them yet.  First impressions are very positive.  The directions say do it barefoot.  For group play-athlete's foot, anyone?"
3888,5,my first Tales game and is still my favorite so far.  I love the music.
3889,5,GOOD!!!
3890,5,I loved startrek tng for a long time. This game helped live some of the old memory's. It's challenging and fun to play.
3891,5,"People say this one is better then Judgement, which i agree mostly because of horde mode."
3892,5,"This style of RPG is my favorite, great game."
3893,5,Works as described.  Combined with a Nyko Powerstand.
3894,5,"I LOVE this game.  Full stop.  Here's what I look for in a RPG in a nutshell: 1) is it immersive? and 2) is it fun?  This game is YES and YES!  This game is addictive as well, which is an added bonus.  PC-based, single player RPG fans, you can really stop reading here.

To me, the reason to write a review is to warn others NOT to buy something or, preferably, to sing the praises of a product that is really outstanding.  This is the latter.  Others have commented on all of the amazing things about this game: beautiful gorgeous visuals, vast world, good story, plenty of opportunities for ""loot"", etc. so I won't spend any time on that.  This review is purely for those who are on the fence about getting this game.  If you love RPGs (especially on the PC), this game is a MUST.  There really is nothing else to think about.  Games this thorough and well done are a dying breed.  I didn't even see this game on the radar so that makes it even more of a pleasant surprise (as of today the two major game review sites in the States still don't have a review.).  There is nothing particularly groundbreaking here, but the gameplay is soooooo worth it for those looking for a fresh RPG.  If you're not into RPGs, (especially ones that aren't MMORPGs), then maybe you should wait for more thorough reviews.  But if you're generally a PC gamer, then, again, I don't see how you can possibly regret this purchase.

So please don't even click on ANY review under 4 stars since that review is GUARANTEED to be a waste of time and a crock of #$%^.  Are there some stumbles here?  Of course, but they are minor (needs a better tutorial, combat is hard to figure out, so much is unexplained and left to be figured out, and it begins pretty linearly for the first few hours).  But I haven't encountered a single bug or glitch so far (after an embarrassing amount of hours of play) - that's so rare for a launch (and my computer is about 2 years old by modern gaming standards).  Also, the premium package includes a very good user guide and game guide, and a DVD Rom with developer videos, soundtrack, and a coin.  These guys really went out of their way to make a great game and give user a tremendous value.  So, again, IGNORE all reviews under 4 stars, and get this game!!

EDIT: I should add that there are a couple of ""fair"" criticisms (though neither worth docking more than one star).  The first is the ""save"" mechanic.  It is really bad that you have practically no-control over saved games (e.g. no modifiable slots, etc.) and that saves eventually take up a ton of space.  This is a easy fix with a patch and a small price to pay for such a great game (you can simply delete the old files manually - annoying but minor).  The other is the combat.  Most of the negative combat reviews are clearly people who just started playing (only a few hours).  It is punishing at first (I play on normal).  But is that really a negative???  I've eventually been able to win all my battles so far (sometimes after a dozen tries) because I finally learned SEVERAL things early on.  First, how to dodge and parry.  Second, how to use bombs in combat and also use traps.  Third, how to use signs/magic (e.g. 30 secs of relative invincibility).  Fourth, how to flank.  Fifth, how to occasionally avoid combat. Combat in TW2 is WAY more strategic than mere button mashing.  If you want to run in and button mash, you will die - over and over and over.  You need to think and be creative, and - GASP - strategize.  And, ultimately, is DOES get better.  This, to me, is a reason to GIVE stars, not take away.  I'm sitting here at work just itching to get back home and play this amazing game!!

EDIT 2:  There are clearly trolls lurking on here and deliberately dinging all 5-star reviews.  I'm not sure of their affiliation or agenda, but it's pathetic."
3895,5,"This time there is actually a story behind all of this. The problem is that the story is difficult to follow the first time through. After you beat the game once your gonna want to play it agian, and this time your gonna understand the story real well. All those dips*it's that say it was to short HAVE YOU BEATIN THE GAME ON EVERY DIFFICULTY? I don't think so, you would be a freak if you beat it already on every difficulty. I pre-ordered this set because of the case, but the disc is very cool too. Now the gameplay is very cool, and if you want a sweet tip go to [...] and look for my hint it's under mightytoaster91. Overall though Halo 2 is overated, so buy it, but you might just see it as a rehash."
3896,5,"We have the pc version and the PS2 version.  Graphics on the pc are flawless but character is so much harder to control using default mouse and keyboard setup.  I also tried using my Microsoft steering wheel and my joystick and its still hard to control.
On the PS2 the graphics are less but the console game controller is so much eaier to to work with.
Other then that the game is great, if you liked the Two Towers, you won't be disappointed."
3897,5,Perfect! Thank you! :-)
3898,5,"Love it!  It's small, quiet, and looks great.  A great improvement over the original model  It runs very quiet and they even got rid of the power brick.  You can't go wrong!"
3899,5,A classic n64 game.
3900,5,"Ok, first off, this game has to do with one of the most creative and innovative superheroes on the market, Spider-Man, created by the comic book genius Stan Lee.  Now combine that with superb graphics, intense and non-repetitve gameplay (minus the cheesy sayings...blech), plus the ability to climb walls, swing from building to building like an urban Tarzan, and you have one of the greatest games for GameCube, or any system for that matter.  Shortly after I got this game I went to see the movie.  I was utterly amazed with the fact that this game was able to stick to the movie so closely without giving critical points away, as well as add even more than was shown on the big screen.  So if you don't have this game, either 1) you don't have a GameCube 2) you have a GameCube and something is seriously wrong with you or 3) you're on your way to the store to BUY THIS NOW!  Good luck webheads!"
3901,5,"This an amazing mouse, and for the price I don't think there is any better deal. I've purchased mice that cost over $100 dollars in the past, but I would chose this mouse of them any day. I bought this recent one for my boyfriend since his Razer Naga finally died on him. But I've personally been using this mouse for over 3 years now and it's still working just as well as the day I bought it. I even bought one to replace my mouse at work because it's so comfortable. Definite bonus that it's a very cool looking mouse as well. Highly recommend it."
3902,5,Tons of fun for everyone in the house!
3903,5,This was an exellent game! the graphics were awsome and so were the sound effects and weapon choices. everything was good except that if u didn't use the slowmo bullet time u lost to much health and u would die fast. if u are a blood and gore fan (i am) than don't turn the gore section off! i highly reccomend this game!
3904,5,"Gotham City.. its a dark and snowy christmas  eve  christmas carols are being sung  churches are ringing bells ..trees being decorated....you look up and you see a 6  ft bat swinging  overhead  in the moonlight...not what youd expect to see eh?  then again in gotham  thats exactly  what you  experience  when you play  Batman: Arkham  Origins.

this ""prequel"" to the  fantastic arkham game series...  Finds  The  Batman  in his second year as Gotham's  guardian ...but alas..theres no rest for the worlds greatest detective..not even during the holidays...because thats when all the Nut jobs  really come out to play..

 the set up is pretty simple  Black mask , who at this time is the crime lord of Gotham..puts out a contract..a very BIG contract  50 million dollars for one night's work...the job  to Kill  The  Batman... some of the worlds top Hitmen and psychos are up to the task  but theres one thing..they NEVER tangled  with the bat.. until now !

the gameplay in this one..is smooth as silk..the combat system is basically retained from the first 2 games  so its easy to pick up and get in on the action..the combos are incredible..you can feel the bones  break in this one...especially when those full screen takedown come into play...can you say OUCH....  there are the usual puzzles, detective work and the like...that puts you in the heat of the action..if your a batman fan, this is a no brainer to pic up...its really a great game..  there is a lot  to enjoy in this one..feel free to explore gotham.. solve some of the riddlers challenges..stop crimes in progress...Lots to check out...plus the score is brilliant  errie and somber..and it fits the mood of the game perfectly..

since, at this time batman is still a so called outlaw by the police..  capt gordon is still trying to figure what to make of him which makes for a great side storyline as well...also, you have many firsts  including meeting up briefly with the joker(epic!) , firefly, Killer crock, the penguin  etc..  alfred is here too with his dry sense of humor that always makes me smile...  batman has the batwing in this one to get around...and it looks amazing...

the graphics here are outstanding  and shine on the Xbox 360...proving that some good games are still being ported to this system even during  the time of the Xbox one(i have both)  ...i have to address  whole Glitch issue freezing  etc...sure, it happens  but,  i didn't have any problems so far  and im almost finished with  it already.. all my saves work as well... .  the online challenges and gameplay are top notch.. and are worth checking out..  ignore the negative reviews and check this one out  for yourself.  chances are youll be glad you did,,,

 Batman: Arkham origins  is quickly becoming my favorite game  in the series..because well, lets face it  the origin stories are  usually the best :)

cant wait for the next in the series for the Xbox one...."
3905,5,Great gate instant classic. Must have for PS1 or survival horror collecters.
3906,5,Everything seems to be in order no issues when plugged up.
3907,5,"This is one of my favorite hidden picture games.  I have played it start to finish a few times now, and enjoy it every time.  The graphics are stunning, and each time I play I do my best to finish each scene just a little bit faster.  I also challenge myself to not use hints because you lose points each time you do.  I don't think anyone buying this game will be disappointed with it."
3908,5,Great game
3909,5,Good seller nice and reasonable price mouse
3910,5,One of the best N64 games ever.
3911,5,Thank you.
3912,5,Tried to wear this game out.  You are only limited by your own imagination.
3913,5,"This game has a little something for everyone. The visuals are superb,  the story is engaging, and the gameplay is spot-on. I cannot reiterate enough how good the visuals are in this game. I have a gaming PC that is very high-end and I have never played a game that presents the visuals that are in this game. Whatever settings that I would initially think would put my PC above a console be it physx, tress effects and such do not compare to what naughty dog has done. The character models are eerily realistic comma the movement is almost life-like comma and the realistic physics almost mirror real life.

If all you like to do is play single player grand Epic Adventures then this is your game. If you prefer fast-paced multiplayer action then this is your game. Even if all you like to do is watch a cool story and you are not much of a gamer there is Easy Settings that make you auto aim on targets thus progressing you very quickly to the story parts of the game. This allows accessibility to almost everyone who would want to enjoy this story.

If you have the extra money then the Uncharted collection 1 through 3 plus this game is some of the greatest gaming experiences you will ever have.

While it is sad that this franchise is over comma it is one that is filled with highlights. It is never dull and you know that naughty dog is presenting you with their very best and is not just trying to milk a franchise."
3914,5,"I don't know if there's any reason to get the SNES version now that Super Street Fighter II has been included in so many newer compilation sets, but in its heyday this was arguably the best fighting game you could own on 16-bit consoles. Sure Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Street Fighter Alpha 2 eventually offered more playable characters, but those ports were visibly incomplete and hampered by limited cartridge space. With Super Street Fighter II, you'd be hard-pressed to tell anything was missing or changed if you hadn't played the arcade original.

So we have a mixture of 16 new and returning fighters, with the old ones slightly tweaked in typical Capcom fashion. Levels and music have also been slightly remixed, and you get redrawn character sprites for the versus screen. There are also bonus tournament, battle, and time challenge modes which would become a staple in all fighting games. The only things missing are the faster turbo mode of the previous installment and Akuma, who wasn't included until the next iteration of the game.

A very meaty and worthwhile fighting game. This is a required play for fans of the genre, whether on the SNES or newer editions."
3915,5,"I have a rule that if I own ONE of something that says Pokemon, I keep it.  PokeFan forever and always.  I never had this game, but I know I need it to trade up all of my retro styled Pokemon.  I clone them in Silver or another later game, and I can transfer them up to the current games of X or Y.  This game was missing from my link of being able to do so (like trading a Charizard to Silver, teach it fly, and then trade it back), and now, it's a worry no more.  Decided to do so while the prices are still cheap (under $100)."
3916,5,Very nice with this little thing PSTV. I love it!
3917,5,"This is my first Dragon Quest Heroes that I have from the line. The graphics are so sharp and beautiful. The gameplay is very friendly and entertaining. You start having fun from the beginning without getting frustrated or stock from level one. It is a lot more to do that just smashing bottons. I love anime, love this game. A must have."
3918,5,This game is fun to play. Grand kids love it!
3919,5,I love It
3920,5,Grandson LOVED THEM... They were here FAST!
3921,5,"Good product, thanks"
3922,5,"My 10 year old son loves this, and anything Skylanders, of course.  He is very happy with this character."
3923,5,Delivered on time. Great game for children.
3924,5,its awesome!
3925,5,Fantastic!
3926,5,The Wii to HDMI converter does exactly as expected. Great product!
3927,5,To me and my eight year old Lego games are the best.  Not to hard for him to lose it and not to easy that he finishes it in a day.  Have all the Star Wars ones and this one is just as good as the rest.
3928,5,"My son uses this controller more than the Halo controller that came with his Halo-edition xbox one.  He loves the unique styling of this one, although I think the functionality is the same.  Great product - highly recommend."
3929,5,"I've read the X-Men comic books religiously since I was a wee Irish Child.  I will say that although Banshee is not in the game, very many X-Men are mentioned and Very Many X-Men are playable in the game.  The story is very consistent with the comics, and everything said in character conversations were again exremely consistent with how they behave in the Comics.  The best X-Men game ever that puts together the incredible story as well as character complexities, as well as the spirit of teamwork and diversity that is the X-MEN!!!  Aye laddy!"
3930,5,"After all the delays and speculations its finally here. If your a rpg fan or a south park fan you are doing yourself a big disservice by not picking up this game. The gameplay is great as is the story/writing.

now the collectors edition I think its worth the ORIGINAL asking price not what the prices are now. The figure is cool as is the map and box."
3931,5,"Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is really thin on content for anyone who just came off Gran Turismo 4 or even Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec. So, if hundreds of cars, thousands of aftermarket parts, and dozens of tracks is mandatory then don't consider GT5 Prologue.

However, what's actually on the disc is almost perfect. The driving is excellent and the force feedback with a wheel is tremendous. The technology is great, with gorgeous lighting and the best looking cars I have seen in a game. The challenges are easily beatable depending on your skill, but I have tons of fun just trying to do hot lap and rise up in the rankings.

The only place I can really ding the game is in online play. There is no way to make a private lobby, and early races are plagued with people who play like its Burnout. But it's in there, and you can earn money for better cars quickly. A better online system would give the game a lot more replayability.

So, basically, the physics, look and feel, and feature set are all greatly improved over past games. It doesn't have much content but the core driving experience is as usual superb."
3932,5,"Crisis Core is the most fun I've had with a game in years. Sure there are some flaws in the gameplay, but the story, characters, side quests (missions + materia fusing), and the music (my favorite OST in years!) absolutely rock me. The ending is just immensely well done and makes up for any gripes I had with the Digital Mind Wave (DMW). It's just such a beautifully tragic finale.

Unlike most PSP RPGs, this game can be played in quick bursts, making it ideal for a portable system. The game has a group of bonus missions that can be played any time you're at a save point. Most of them take five to ten minutes, with the later ones requiring more time. It actually takes more time to complete all the bonus missions than it does to beat the story mode. Of course the missions aren't as exquisite an experience as the story mode.

I guess that's what's so unique about the game -- it's an emotionally moving tragedy. From Zack to Genesis to Angeal to Sephiroth, things just end on such a sad note. It was nice seeing how awesome Sephiroth was before he lost it. It just makes his character in FFVII all the more pitiful. And poor Aerith...she just can't get more than two days of happiness at a time.

I've beaten the game twice -- once to experience the story and a second time to complete all the missions and bonus quests. I'm actually halfway through a third run since the game is fantastic for quick bursts of play. I don't see the game coming out of my PSP for a long, long time."
3933,5,Excelente
3934,5,great deal and fast delivery
3935,5,"You know this game is scary? Don't worry, I will enjoy this game."
3936,5,"Features are as realistic as ever. Love how the crowd and the atmosphere is so realistic. Gameplay is awesome. Especially love how you can play with old-school controls for long-time players like myself. Do not like the GM function, but other than that, it is masterfully done. Excellent music in the soundtrack as well."
3937,5,This game was awesome. I couldn't stop playing it from start to finish. I am so happy with the direction Crystal Dynamics is going with this series and I can't wait to see what is next.
3938,5,"Back in the early 2000's, Sega released Phantasy Star Online for the Dreamcast, and it was met with great critical praise. The concept was relatively simple: kill things, get loot, kill more things, get more loot, etc. Of course, the higher level you got, the bigger the things you could kill, and the better the loot you would receive as a reward. And it was addicting. VERY addicting. And the best part was you could play it online with up to three other people for free.

Several iterations of the game have come and gone on various platforms including the Dreamcast, Xbox, Gamecube, and even the PC. Slowly but surely, Sega started to shut down its servers, with the final servers going offline on April 22, 2008. Unofficial servers are still around, however, and hundreds of people are still playing it online.

Some fans of Phantasy Star Online moved on to Phantasy Star Universe, but it changed a lot of the things that people liked about the original. For example, Phantasy Star Universe had a separate offline story mode with different fixed characters, and you could only use your custom-designed characters online. Also, there were failure rates for improving/synthesizing weapons, which often required ultra rare items found in the game. Lastly, mags were done away with in favor of ""partner machinery"".

Thankfully, Sega returned to the Phantasy Star Online roots when it unleashed Phantasy Star Zero upon the world. You use the same character online as offline; synthesizing and improving weapons has no failure rate; and best of all, mags are back.

There are some welcome changes from the original, although there are some awkward design decisions made as well.

One change for the better is the ability to lock on to enemies and strafe using the L shoulder button. This handy little button also allows you to shoot gun weapons while moving (though you can't combo moving shots), which makes combat for rangers a little less harrowing.

Another change from the original is a significant increase to the number of rare enemy drops you'll find. You could quest for weeks in the original Phantasy Star Online hunting for a particular item with no luck, but in Phantasy Star Zero, you're far more likely to find the items you're looking for (provided you're playing in the appropriate area and on the appropriate difficulty).

Up next are titles, a far more productive take on the Achievements system popularized by the 360 console. In Phantasy Star Zero, you can complete various objectives ranging from the simplest of things like trading a certain number of photon drops or petting all the cats in town, to more difficult things such as getting a 10 hit chain in battle or defeating a boss in under a minute. Unlike Achievements on the 360, which are usually entirely useless in the context of the games, for every title you earn in Phantasy Star Zero, you are given a reward. The rewards can be rare weapons or armors, materials to boost your stats, or even items which can improve the power of your weapons.

There are also two new weapon types - Shields and Gunblades. Shields allow you to block attacks using the L button, and Gunblades are exactly what you'd think they are - melee swords that can also be used to shoot at medium range by holding the L button. Apart from the new weapons, there are also special attacks on many weapons which can be used by holding the attack button to charge it.

The charging technique also works for all the techniques (a.k.a. spells) in the game. For example, if you use the healing technique Resta, you can choose to heal just yourself or charge for a few moments to heal everyone around you. Likewise if you charge an attack spell, it changes to a more powerful version that can damage multiple enemies.

Unfortunately, with the addition of charging the techniques, Sega also decided to disallow their use directly from the menu - meaning you have to put them in one of your action palette slots in order to use them. This can be a little annoying, particularly when you simply want to cure someone of a status condition, since by the time you've swapped in the Anti technique and gone back out of the menu, most of the status effects will have worn off by that time.

Another unfortunate loss is the ability to bring up a ""quick switch"" menu. In the original Phantasy Star Online for Dreamcast, you could hold down the R trigger and press the Y button to bring up a quick menu for weapons, armor, items, techniques, etc. and you could easily and quickly use this feature to switch weapons in less than a half a second. (if you use melee weapons, for example, and needed to pull out a gun to destroy a trap at a distance), or quickly cast a technique or use an item not regularly in your action palette. This was an essential tool for higher level play, and it's sad to see that it has disappeared.

The rest of the game mechanics remain quite similar to the original Phantasy Star Online, although the story is far more involved than the original game. Phantasy Star Online sort of had hints strewn throughout the game as to what had happened and it was up to you to put together the pieces if you wanted. Phantasy Star Zero has an actual story (split into three storylines - one for each race) that you go through to complete the game, and it doesn't really leave any loose ends for the player to try to puzzle through at the end. Do take note that Phantasy Star Zero is NOT a remake of Phantasy Star Online - this is an entirely new game with a completely different storyline, enemies, areas, characters, etc. It just plays a heck of a lot alike.

Of course, everyone knows that the true fun of Phantasy Star Online was in the multiplayer, and the same is true with Phantasy Star Zero. It is fully compatible with the Nintendo Wi-Fi service, and playing online is once again completely free. You can play with strangers (with appropriate options as to what difficulty or area you want to play in), or you can play with friends (either using Friend Codes on the Wi-Fi Connection, or using the DS system's local wireless if you've got people nearby. If you're playing with friends, you can use the game's built in ""picto-chat"" to send messages to the team, and even have some ""standard"" messages saved for quick access (such as ""HEAL ME!!!"" or ""Careful! Traps Ahead!"") in situations where you may not have much time to dilly dally.

No matter who you're playing with, the game solves a problem that has persistently plagued multiplayer RPGs for ages - who gets the loot. In Phantasy Star Zero, everyone gets their own set of item drops, so there's no more issues with one obnoxious twit hanging around and grabbing every rare item before you can get to it.

After you've beaten the game, there's still lots to do in the hard and super difficulties, and lots more loot to be collected (and naturally, to show off or trade to your friends). If you were one of the many folks addicted to Phantasy Star Online, chances are you'll get hooked on Phantasy Star Zero as well. It's every bit as good as the original, just in a convenient to-go package."
3939,5,arrived fast and was exactly as described
3940,5,"Excellent product is very good, works fine I have no problem with its use, which is recommended for all ."
3941,5,"I saw this was on sale and threw it in to bring my order over the threshold for free shipping and thought I'd give it a try.  I was happily impressed with the improvement it made.  More comfortable to hold the controller, especially for an extended period of time. The foam is soft, but firm and not bulky.  Very easy to apply and it appears to have a strong adhesive.  I will be ordering another for my other 360 controller, as well as for my two PS3 controllers."
3942,5,"If you are an action-adventure-puzzle gamer, then Castlevania Lords of Shadow is a great game to get. The gameplay is very fluent. God of War like??, yeah... but that doesnt mean is bad, it's actually a formula that works very well. The graphics, music and narration are very well done. The gameplay, for me at least, its very well paced, and the boss battles, Wow Shadow of the Colossus big, maybe bigger.

I saw some of the reviews, specially the one at IGN and i really can not understand as to why the 7.5 score. I mean, if you want to take points off because of lack of originality.. fine, but I think its fair to bring the score up for one thing that many of these games these days do not have and that's the 16 to 19 hours of gameplay in a single campaign. I think C:LOS is about the same lenght as all of the God of War(1,2,3)games combined. Also, this new Castlevania might not be the castlevania we knew previously, but I myself, welcome the new facelift it has been given, and hope that they make a sequel in the near future. I would definitely say give this one a try."
3943,5,Good copy...lucky me.
3944,5,"This collection contains the three most enjoyable games ever concieved. First, the Ultimate Doom which set the world ablaze with its sharp visuals and pulse-pounding single and multiplayer gaming. The second game, Doom 2, was not as good as the original -- it was better. A host of new, more deadly, foes and even more creative maps make it a worthy addition to the Doom franchise. The last game of the set, Final Doom, is an interesting work. It was not made by Id Software, but rather, a set of maps produced by a team named TeamTNT. It's essentially two 32 level episodes that are based off the Doom storyline. The maps are of the highest quality and due to their difficulty on the higher skill levels, they're great co-op games.

In short, if you don't have all three of these games, buy this collection. It's great as a single player game, but when you've got a LAN party going, coupled with one of the modern source ports (Doom Legacy is a good one), you can have some of the most intense gaming moments you've ever experienced -- outdoing today's top titles.

I state again for clarity: buy it."
3945,5,"Ok so this is my first fire emblem game. So far, it's great. I grew an interest in the series when two of the characters I use in smash 4 are from this game. So I just had to buy it so that I could know the story of their game and get into the series."
3946,5,"It seems that the biggest criticisms of this game are the lack of challenging puzzles and the amount of ""walking"" that Kate has to do. Since I'm terrible at puzzles that have nothing to do with clues that are part of the storyline, this was fine with me. In additon, anyone who complains about having to ""walk around"" a great deal, shouldn't be playing adventure games. That's simply part of the genre. If the player happens to move in the right direction and collect all clues and inventory the first time, there are fewer trips from place to place. If the player isn't that lucky, then they end up visiting locales numerous times - that's just the way most of the adventure games I've ever played work.
As everyone has pretty much mentioned already, the graphics are astounding! I enjoyed all the characters and locales. The music was unobtrusive and the dialogue made sense. My biggest complaint with ""The Longest Journey"" was the amount of dialogue - volumes - Syberia was a great inmprovement in this regard.
I agree with some of the other reviewers that the cellphone started to get on my nerves - but once we see that Dan and Olivia are having an affair, I got a kick out of it. It also helped to demonstrate how Kate evolves from a mousey woman who had never been adventurous before to an independent woman who is ready to chuck everything to go join Hans and Oscar on the train instead of returning to New York. I can't wait until Syberia II comes out in April 2004 to see what awaits them."

3948,5,"One of the best games I've played, hands down. The procedurally generated adventures ensures that each expedition will be different from the last. Play for hours to unlock all of the ships, layouts, and achievements. The advanced edition expansion also adds new weapons, ships, and crew for free."
3949,5,"6/28/2016 - I haven't gotten far into the game yet, i'll update as I get further into it. I've played all the star oceans (Except psp ports). I've always been a huge fan of the series. Seeing it come to life on the ps4 with enhanced graphics is wonderful. It still has the live fighting, but even better. Now instead of running into a mob and it loads the fight up, it instantly goes into battles (Kinda like monster hunter). It still has all the star ocean tid bits such as the berries for HP and MP healing.

You start off in a village by the ocean, you're the blue haired swordsman named Fidel. You're good buddy's name is Ted, The two hear rumors of an invasion, Fidel decides to investigate  the rumors.  (star ocean always has some of the most unique names)

This game is the perfect mix. Live action fighting, (not turn based). Set in space, lots of cool stuff to see. Quality graphics. Lovable characters!

What's in store for you in this game:

 Character development, this game always delivers on this point. Already the game shows a lot of promise on character development. I think i'll be a little sad when the game ends.

The storyline, so far the storyline hasn't developed a ton; however, in all other star oceans it's been a roller coaster ride.

Tons to do, these games are jam packed with cooking, events, tons of other types of things. I haven't gotten into a lot of that yet, but I will update as I play the game.

If you're a fan of RPG games and haven't played star ocean before, I recommend it 100%. This game is beautifully designed. The characters are great so far, I'm going to have a blast playing this game.

7/01/2016 - Update.

There are a few things that bug me about the game, but over all I still have a fun experience.

The characters voices are well recorded but some of their emotions don't seem to come through as well as I'd hope. Sometimes characters are excited but their voice isn't, or scared and their voice doesn't relay that to me. (Mainly non main characters). I'd have to say I wish they spent a little more time on this.

The camera - I don't really have a lot of issues with the camera, I usually just keep my thumb on the right analog to counter act it. But it seems they put in a system to accommodate the camera position for you running up and down stairs and over rocks and what not. So sometimes it likes to jump forward on your character which can be annoying, (not a big deal in my opinion).

The party - So far I hadn't had to do anything special to get party members, they just kinda randomly show up and join up and then leave and come back. I do wish there was secret characters like in star ocean 2.  (If there is, I hadn't encountered it yet.)

Still a fun game, one of the best jrpg games on the ps4 that I've played. If you're  a fan, still worth taking a chance for."
3950,5,"Yakuza 3 was my entry into the Yakuza series.  I did not have a PS2, so I have not gotten a chance to play the first two.  There was much controversy about the cut content in Yakuza 3, and at the time, I did not understand the significance of what I was missing.  Nevertheless, I fell in love with the Yakuza series with Yakuza 3.  Now, with Yakuza 4, I got to experience what I was missing, and also got the opportunity to play as other characters with different fighting styles.

This is a great game.  You start off as one character, and you switch to other characters as they are introduced into the main story line.  Near the end, all four story lines converge for a finale.  Each character has a unique fighting style and weapons; one uses his feet to kick and jump, one uses his fists and pure strength, and one uses his speed to dodge and uses the momentum of the opponent to quickly dodge and throw the enemy.  The fourth character Kazuma is skilled in all of the weapons, and has his own fighting techniques from the previous game.

I played this game for over 200 hours to clear out all of the side quests and get the Platinum Trophy.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and if you like RPGs, Brawlers, mini-games, and gritty mob stories, take a chance on this game and hopefully you will have as good of an experience as I have."
3951,5,I must say I was skeptical at first after playing the first one. I was not a big fan of the first zumba. But this one is awesome. The only thing I am not a huge fan of is the music selection. It would be nice to have more well know people or to be able to purchase other songs for it. But it is a great workout. I highly recommend it. I own a bunch of wii exercise games. But this is definitely one the best.
3952,5,"I had gotten this at the time as a collection. (I like to collect the physical boxes of the games I purchase). I originally obtained the game digitally (before it was Free to play).
The game itself was pretty good. Haven't played in a while, but from what i've seen there are a lot of new additions and features."
3953,5,As described
3954,5,"I love Resident Evil, and this one is my favorite. I play it back in years, but i was very young and i never knew how to play it. So now, i finish the game and i can say: This is the best !!"
3955,5,"Demon & Dark Souls fans: praise the sun and rejoice! An exhilarating, horrifying jaunt through a gorgeous Gothic nightmare, Bloodborne is a fittingly brutal follow-up to From Software's household name action-RPG series. From the terrific and terrifying art design to the swift, palpable combat, Bloodborne eschews the broad sweeps of its fantasy brethren in favor of viscera-soaked terror, and it's all the better for it.

Bloodborne's story is every bit as opaque as its Souls predecessors': a tellingly labeled ""hunter"", you're loosed upon the city of Yharnam to fell all manner of horrors that lie within. These range from deranged infected townsfolk to massive werebeasts, and each foe you face is entirely capable of slicing you limb from limb unless you're careful...

... Or quick! Unlike the Soul's series, Bloodborne makes it clear from the get-go that speed and aggression are your two best friends on the night of the hunt. Gone are shields and tank-like heavy armor-- instead, you're supplied with a firearm and a ""trick weapon"". While firearms are excellent tools for stunting enemy attacks and stemming their charge, trick weapons offer two switchable forms, each with its own unique set of moves. Learning to mix-and-match your trick weapon forms is a must, as some enemies won't play nice up close (or afar, for that matter). Aggressive play is also highly encouraged with a newly implemented regeneration system. If you're wounded , you're given a chance to regain lost health but getting up close and personal with your attacker. By literally bathing in their blood, you regain health... I can't make this stuff up.

Unraveling the secrets of the world is one of the best parts of Bloodborne, and there's a large spool to pull from. The game is rife with hidden passages, cryptic story bits, great NPC dialogue give-aways, and some excellent nods to Lovecraftian horror. Bosses, while terrifying surprises in their own right, are incredibly rewarding to best: you'll be whooping with joy once you topple some of these monstrosities, and with good reason, too. Bloodborne is a game crafted so deftly, its hard not to walk away a little dazed. For those seeking more, there's plenty to be had: New Game+ offers a fresh chance at perfecting your techniques, and the just-release Old Hunters DLC makes for an absolutely essential buy with fans of the main game. The hunt is on: get to it!"
3956,5,"product arrived on time and are very good, a responsible person is recommended."
3957,5,I like the wired controller better than the wireless that came with my Xbox because there is no delay when I move a control.
3958,5,"Oh man.

As soon as you turn it on - it's like your childhood went full-tilt insane.  Those of us who played Zelda: Link to the Past as kids (or young adults, what have you) will have your minds blown the second the game queues up.

It's the Link to the Past overworld, reimagined and presented in some of the cleanest 3d i've seen yet on the 3ds.  It's mindblowing that Nintendo can get such great visuals out of its largely-crap hardware - while other studios struggle to maintain 30fps with crap visual fidelity, this game pulls a solid 60fps at almost all times and looks great while doing so.

Why, again, was the Ocarina of Time remake so hideous looking, at 30fps nonetheless?  /sigh.

Biggest change to this game is that you have almost immediate access to all subweapons.  Rather than lock each subweapon to each dungeon as a treasure - they require heavy use of one subweapon PER dungeon.  You rent them from a rather hilarious NPC - and can later buy them (so you don't lose them if/when you die).  Tons of good collection mechanics, including age-old heart pieces and these new little snail-looking guys that allow you to power up your subweapons.

The game claims you'll have a lot more to do with your Ruppees than ever before, but I still found myself hopelessly overloaded with money the entire game long with little to use it on.  I still think the best Ruppee-vs-buyable-crap balance was in Zelda: The Minish Cap.

My main dislikes are that there's almost too much content.  There's a veritable cornucopia of puzzle devices, enemies, etc. - but each one gets used once or twice, then abandoned.  It's really a shame they didn't reuse more devices - as the game feels like it could've been bigger.

Still - without spoiling any enemy types / plot devices, this is the current gold standard for Zelda games.  It'll make you realize how subpar every Zelda has been since Link to the Past - you go back and play Ocarina again and it's a slow-paced ugly looking snoozefest with entirely too much dialogue and combat you can fall asleep during and still win."
3959,5,Works Excellent  with my Brand New Xbox One Controller in play and charge sequences.

3962,5,"Unlike others on this site, these fit very good and the material is durable, which is of utmost importance to me.  I'm glad I found this item."
3963,5,"I've spent a lot of time playing ME1, ME2 and ME3. Thoroughly enjoyed all of them. It's hard for me to understand why so many people reviewing this game on Amazon trash ME3 because of the problems with the ending, which were subsequently addressed, although not completely fixed.

I completed ME3 before reading any reviews on Amazon. I also completed it after Bioware released the updated ending. So when I read all the negative reviews here, I was shocked. To me, Mass Effect is one of the best game franchises of all time. I don't know how I'd feel had I completed ME3 with the original, half-baked/contradictory ending. I hope no one skips playing ME3 because some reviewers are bitter about the first ending."

3965,5,"HP Lovecraft's work is an inspiration for this 3D action adventure game, perhaps the first game which could be termed 'survival horror' and thus an inspiration for hits such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion. You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape.

The graphics combine 3D people with pre-rendered backgrounds in a manner that was new at the time. Limited weaponry means that you can't go in all guns blazing, you have to plan your attacks. Books in the rooms are not mere props, they can be read to gain further information and clues to solving the game's puzzles. Most of the game is non-linear and encourages exploration."
3966,5,"Not much to review, it arrived on time and works!"
3967,5,"From the treks through steamy jungles to the endless wisecracks, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has a lot in common with its 2007 predecessor. You're still controlling the rugged everyman Nathan Drake in an Indiana Jones-inspired adventure, and he hasn't learned many moves since his first outing. But while the sequel may sound by-the-books on paper, the actual results are astonishing. While the original was competent and easy on the eyes, Uncharted 2 is a game that should sell consoles. I cannot believe how well the final project came together.

Uncharted 2 wastes no time throwing you into the action, as Nathan awakens in a wrecked train dangling from the Himalayan cliff. After a harrowing climb back onto the snowy ground, the game flashes back to a tropical beach. Here, he and new ""friends"" Chloe and Flynn discuss how to steal a lamp that may hold Marco Polo's secret directions to Shangri La. From this initial meeting, you'll be struck by how well-written and delivered the dialogue is. Not that the first game was a dramatic slouch, but because you're more familiar with Nathan and company, their actions have much more resonance.

After the beach rendezvous, Uncharted 2 whisks you away to Nepal, where you'll explore temples, a mountain village, a militarized city and a heavily armed train. The level variety puts the original to shame, as if Naughty Dog was trying to address a complaint nobody even had in the first place. And more impressive, every inch of the additional real estate is populated with tons of furniture, fauna and other assorted knickknacks. Though it's hard to stop to look at the rooftops when a missile-launching helicopter is pursuing you, a quick glance at the Nepali skyline will astound with its level of detail.

The presentation has received the biggest boost, but there have been subtle improvements to the combat as well. Melee combos are much more forgiving, so that you can mostly get away with mashing the punch button instead of needing split-second timing. Enemies also absorb fewer bullets than before and are now susceptible to stealthy attacks from behind. The sneakier options and smoother controls mean that combat zones suddenly become Nathan's playgrounds, letting you pick and choose how you want to dispose of your enemies.
Unfortunately, while Nathan's fighting skills have improved, I do wish there were more footholds when it's time to climb. To go from a sprawling arena to a single, linear path can be frustrating, especially when this path is obscured by plants and debris. The game always gives you hints if you're stuck, but I think giving the player a few more entry points would have been the way to go.

The main adventure's 20-plus chapter journey is riveting. It delivers all of the thrills that we had hoped from Indiana Jones last summer, and Nathan's band of sidekicks exudes warmth that other story-driven games lack. But if video game storytelling isn't your thing, the new multiplayer options may hold your attention for a little while. You have standard death match and capture the flag variants, but the real treat is co-op, where up to three players can team up to score some treasure. I don't think the gunplay is going to lure anyone away from holiday biggies like Halo 3: ODST and Modern Warfare 2, but there's some to be had for casual shooter fans.

Even if you never go online, Uncharted 2 arguably offers the most PS3 fun this holiday season. The set pieces are exhilarating, the scenery is gorgeous and the characters play off of each other beautifully. Like Marco Polo in his quest for Shangri La, the industry will release an impressive fleet of games this fall, and only a handful will survive on the shelves. Make sure that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of them.

3968,5,"Works perfect, this came with a CD and sync'd with my Xbox 360 controller right away. It is also the black model and is actually made by microsoft and not an off brand company. I had an issue with motioninjoy cancelling out previous drivers and not allowing me to use the controller at first but after I uninstalled motioninjoy the device detected the controller and was good to go."
3969,5,"This game too is one that I purchased for my cousins, and they like it a lot, so it is safe to say that it is a great play."
3970,5,"Fantastic mouse.

I purchased this to use with my laptop, and was truly surprised at how well this works. Wireless is now viable for gaming.

I had tried wireless mice in the past but they were never quite accurate enough to be used by me for gaming. This mouse absolutely is.

The battery life on this mouse is also unbelievable. I only had to change the pair of AA batteries after almost 6 months had passed."
3971,5,"This product has been excellent so far.  The batteries charge up fast (after the first charging) and last, saving lots of cash on batteries.  I really love this so far.  It is very convenient and plugs right into the USB slot on the back of the WII console with the included cable."
3972,5,"God of War is my favorite ps2 series, now I can enjoy it on my ps3 at 60fps and in HD!
The only downturn was that the in-game movies didn't get remastered, but it didn't bother me at all."

3976,5,"Astal, Nights into Dreams, Burning Rangers, the Panzer Dragoon trilogy...so many games in the Saturn's short lifespan (same with the Dreamcast). SEGA was the go-to company for quality gaming experiences in the 90's. Most people would say otherwise, that Nintendo deserves that title. However, SEGA held their own in the software department. The company's bad marketing decisions were endless, but at least we got some great games out of their self-destructive tendencies. The Saturn, like the N64 and the Playstation, would easily have been a mainstay in my home, if only it was more affordable back in the day, rather than nearly double the asking price for Sony's Playstation. Oh, well, at least I can play these games now, as an adult. Too bad the game prices (mostly) are so high due to greedy sellers and annoying collectors. I blame them for the outrageous jacking-up of the prices. Shame on you people! :P"
3977,5,"An excellent product , recommend  100%"
3978,5,"Holy crap....addicting game. This review is not for the long time fans, but more for the first timers like myself just wondering if it is worth getting or not. Or if they should just wait until the price drops (I usual wait 1-2 years after a game comes out before getting it.

Hint: Get it now. Screw waiting. It is one of the few games you don't want to wait.

My first Fallout game. Bought it on a recommendation from a friend. I was expecting a straight FPS- which I am not a fan of or some MMO- online only.
Thankfully, it was none of these. It is an open world, single player, thinker game. Yes, there is some FPS aspects, but it is not a run-n-gun. Still learning the crafting aspects. They are interesting. Good skill progression. You will revisit areas time and time again. Example: clear it the place out for a mission. Go back for looting of needed resources. Go back again once your skill for pick/hacking a lock is high enough. There is a lot of replay ability in it so far.

Lot of good backstory I am learning. Games like this make me go back and play the previous versions.

There are a lot of references in the game to Americana.

Resources: What you would initially think of as junk. Items like duct tape and table fans are very valuable...for their component parts. Adhesives and screws...never find enough. At least in the beginning.

Settlements: Finding a new settlement. Set up, build, learn the spawn points to concentrate your defenses. Drop in some traders (trade, bars, and clinic) to make caps.

Back to the open world, I played World of Warcraft for years. Loved how you could literally just get lost wandering around seeing all the attention to detail the programmers put into the game. Fallout: its there. They did a lot of work.

One of the few top game I really love enough to say it was worth buying and not waiting.

Update: Now that a bunch of the DLC content has dropped an update is due.
Still addicting. Still addicted- no not going to seek treatment.

Keep in mind, I am a slow player. Level 100+ at this writing. I still have not sided with or against the institute. Nor have I even traveled to Far Harbor.
Every time I think I have mined out the bulk of the main game...surprise. New missions I missed (yes, at level 101) earlier in the game.

Mechanist- great addon. Lets you tinker and build your own robots. Get the hacking skill. It will save you a lot of hassle. Hack-shut down. Now in the middle of fire fight you do not have to fight a big nasty robot (who also gives two fusion cores).
Lots of repeating missions (hunt down robots)

Fight Pits- decent. But I like the fact I can capture brahim (cows) now for my settlements.

Raider DLC- In the middle of this one. Enjoying it. Gage is decent companion who only ""dislikes"" your actions when you take mentats (I usually do for a critical charisma check or maxing a sale with a merchant). Otherwise, kill, pick locks, whatever, he is good. Too bad I will need to kill him later when I burn the raiders to the ground. Spent too long building up my settlements to raid them and unalign them."
3979,5,"When I first began speculating about this game with friends way back in 98'. All I heard was it was gonna be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like X-Wing or TIE fighters. Man, I still will never forget the looks on their faces when I showed them how the game ran and just overall was a masterpiece of graphics and gameplay for it's time anyway. So your saying, yeah well what's the story with this game? Well, you start out as a GTA pilot (Galactic Terran Alliance) fighting a 14 year war against the Vasudans. The AI is impressive as is the combat animations and cutscenes. All I can say to anyone considering buying this is to get it before it is no longer made considering it's age. Enjoy!"
3980,5,"awesome keyboard, takes a while to get use to the keystroke, but worth the crisp clean feel"
3981,5,"I think that everybody that buy this game is only for the wiimote, but is fun to play it for a while...."

3983,5,awesome

3986,5,"This game is one of many that i am taking the liberty to review, that i have owned now for atleast five years.  Vandal Hearts (VH) is a one of a kind game.  Even though there is a second VH out, there is no link whatesoever in the two stories.  If you get sucked into this story, don't expect anything after the end, because that's all your getting.  That is really the only bad thing about this game, because everything else is great.  I am now going to give you a low down on the game.
You are playing the character of a man named Ash.  He is the head of a security force for a local governement.  The game starts with you pretending to be merchants, taking goods across to another town, when your suddenly ambushed by cutthroat thieves.  Little do they know, is that they were the ones ambushed.  When you suddenly reveal yourselves and attack them first.  From this point on in this game, the strorie becomes very interesting.  Eventually your sent across the sea to discover the wherabouts of a missing person, and then to ancient tombs, and just about anywhere else you can imagine.  Along the way you pick up allies that help you along the way.
The intersting thing about VH is the battling system, and the way you upgrade your units.  First you start with a basic class.  Like Archer, Knight, Sorcerer, Priest...etc.  Then you can upgrade their classes once they hit a certain level.  In this case, levels 10 and 20.  The only person with a special job class is your hero Ash.  Also he is the only person with the opportunity to upgrade three times, instead of two.  The problem with this is that you have to unlock six differnet keys.  One for each chapter, and then you have to hope that you can defeat all the enemies behind each of these ""locked doors"".  If you can do that, be can upgrade to the ultimate class, The Vandaler!  This class is godlike.  You basically become damn near impossible to kill.
This game is wonderful and very intense.  I suggest you order this from Amazon as soon as you can.  This game is awesome and will make you very happy to have bought it.  One of the main reasons for that is the replay value.  It is very high.  Higher than most games created by Konami.  ENJOY!!!"
3987,5,Great Price fast shipping
3988,5,"This Is the best HD remake ever, and one that is well deserved. Most developers should learn from this and make the HD remakes that other games deserved (And bumping up the resolution doesn't count).-Andrew Gavin"
3989,5,"Mass Effect 1 open the door for great action, game play combined with the best story telling done in a videogame and this sequel ups it in almost every way. You get to pick who you play as a male or female version of Commander Shepard and must search distant planets out recruiting only the best fighters to help ensure you can save humanity from certain doom. Sounds failure I know, but Bio Ware has done a great job doing it. For starters,Your action has consaquences. Again I have seen this in many games but never felt it really did much of anything other than show a meter go good or bad big deal. But in ME2 even stuff from the first game can effect you, like when I killed one of my members for not agreeing with an order I gave. Very cool! your companions you are picking up actually can kick ass unlike most other games where they don't seem to do much more than stand around and get killed. From there you can do research for gear and upgrades. I found this a bit confusing on how to do it at first but its pretty simple wants you do it a few times. The controls are spot on and head shots are no problem at all. I don't want to give away any of the story but ME1 I thought was the best game I ever played and now this one tops it. And I have been playing since the Atari 2600"
3990,5,Best keyboard ever for a gamer!
3991,5,"In a way, Jak 3 is more of a direct sequel to chapter two than it is a continuation of the storyline that was established in part one. I realize that this was meant to be the end of a journey, a ""coming of age"" story that follows the title character through his innocence, his adolescence, and finally his ascent into adulthood. Bearing in mind, it's only natural that he'd want to distance himself from the people and places that make him feel like an adventuring child, rather than a self-assured saver of globes. ""When I became a man, I put away childish things,"" after all.

Where the inspiration behind the storytelling of Jak II was unquestionably Blade Runner, the main source of direction for this final chapter comes largely from Mel Gibson's The Road Warrior. The outlanders who rescue the title-endorsed duo from their exile and drag them back to their own makeshift shanty town are the textbook definition of an early '80s burly man. They adorn themselves with hundreds of pointy edges, enormous, hopelessly detailed weapons and layer after layer of questionably-hemmed leather. They puff out their chests at every opportunity, and speak like a cluster of throat cancer survivors.

These new characters are just overflowing with personality, which makes the minor cutscenes and motivational speeches entertaining, but I couldn't shake the feeling that they were just going through the motions in an attempt to mimic the successful main cast of the second game. It's like they were trying to match the edge of the gritty, sullen warriors of Jak II, but were missing some intangible element that kept them from reaching that full potential. The twists and turns of their storylines were somewhat transparent (I'd figured out the major twist in Damas's story within an hour of meeting him), their importance to the central plot is thrown into question fairly early on, (when you return to the city around the three hour mark and only occasionally return to the desert thereafter) and for all of their gusto, their emotional impact on the player doesn't hold a candle to the inner-city gangs that ran chapter two.

As the ""last"" game in the series, (Daxter on the PSP and Jak X: Combat Racing have since been released, continuing the saga, and there are rumors of a new game on the PS3) Jak 3 is an atypical grand finale. A lot of things didn't happen that I expected to during the ""wrap up"" cutscene at the very end, and vice-versa... I was caught off guard by more than a few revelations, including the Wizard of Oz-styled reveal just before the final boss. For the first time, I think the series found its stride in the vein of comedy it had sought since day one. The character interactions are actually very funny in places - I legitimately laughed out loud on more than one occasion, which is not something I'm known to do during a game.

With the outline in place and the unexpected twists and turns counteracting the few more obvious revelations, Jak 3's story would have set the stage for one of the greatest final chapters in video gaming history - if only it were a bit longer. Jak 3 weighs in at about a dozen hours, which is less than half the length of Jak II, and that results in a much less rewarding experience than you'd hope for in a final episode. It also wasn't nearly as difficult as its immediate predecessor, which means less screaming and shouting, but also less relief and self-assuredness upon reaching that final scene. After completing part two, I had a sense of accomplishment, almost pride, at having finished such an elaborate and difficult game. I didn't get that same sensation upon putting this one to bed.

One area in which Jak 3 doesn't disappoint is the ""holy crap"" department. It just spoils you with these things - you'll control Daxter as he clings for dear life onto a speeding missle, (a live freaking MISSLE!) you'll leap onto a teensy platform while the camera leers above you and displays the dizzying heights below, you'll take down creatures the size of a whale... just unimaginably cool stuff. It doesn't overload on the action in quite the way that God of War did, but it's pretty close, and the last full hour of gameplay is one of those long moments that transcends mere video gaming and puts the player right into the middle of a summer blockbuster. I've long considered the last stage of the original Halo to be one of the, if not the greatest level in the history of gaming, and I'd seriously consider the closing moments of Jak 3 at least on par with that. So, yeah, very high praise indeed.

In both the grand finale and throughout the entirety of the game, there's a lot of variety in the gameplay. This is not just your standard jump, shoot and explore adventure game. You'll bump into an odd blend of flight stages, DDR-style coordination stages, racing levels and railed first person shooter segments, in addition to the exploring, jumping, punching, shooting and all-around adventuring levels. And, while this is something I had a big problem with when it was shoved into the mechanics of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, it doesn't bother me so much here. The main reason is because the Jak series has always had some sort of similar variety ingrained within it, but it's also a bit more admissible here because the setup actually works. Nothing feels like it's been needlessly crammed into the proceedings, like the dance stages or the workout levels of San Andreas... it all just works together, several parts of a whole.

While the basic gameplay model (and its dedication to consistently bending genres) has remained mostly intact, there are two notable variations from the functionality of Jak II that become abundantly clear within the first couple of hours. First and foremost is the much, much heavier emphasis that's placed on the driving stages, more so than in The Precursor Legacy and Jak II combined. In this third chapter, they're vital to the completion of half the game's levels, including the final boss fight. It's almost to the point that I'd call this an ""action / racing"" title, because you'll find yourself spending as much time behind the wheel as you are on foot.

When it was successful, the vehicle-based gameplay was a blast, something that's never really been tried before - a sort of supercharged platformer on wheels. On the few stages that failed, however, the wheels felt like a gimmicky death trap. Incredibly frustrating, like trying to shove a square peg through a round opening. Largely, the vehicle stages were a roaring success, however.

Secondly, there's the revelation that there is a ""Light Jak"" to mirror the beastial ""Dark Jak"" that was unveiled in the second game. Where Jak's darker persona brought with it a variety of new attacks and offensive maneuvers, his light side focuses more on exploratory aids and defensive mechanisms. As such, it's not quite as exciting to play as ""Light Jak"" for the first time as it was to burst into ""Dark Jak"" mode near the opening of Jak II. It's just not as much fun to grow wings and casually flutter around a room as it is to fire purple lightning out of your fingertips and fry the opposition. These light powers enable a few new modes of exploration for the die-hard fan, but are generally fairly useless and go unused until the situation demands that you employ them. F

As far as controls are concerned, it's a pretty tight ship at this point in the series. Most of the infuriating glitches and bugs from the first game were ironed out in the second chapter, and the third game actually improves upon the near-perfection attained by the second. A few jump commands go unrecognized, and I had some problems with touchy collision detection during the faster races (which meant I had to hit the checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again) but those are minor gripes at best.

Visually, this could pass as Jak II's identical twin. The characters look almost exactly the same as in the previous chapter, and all of the little quirks, cartoony exaggerations and background puns that gave the first two games their identity are here in living color. It's not the best looking game I've ever played, and I didn't notice much of a difference upon switching to progressive scan, but it's near the top of its genre all the same. I'd imagine the phrase ""ain't broke, don't fix it"" could be applied to Jak 3 without hesitation

The voice acting is one area that's been kept fairly high in quality throughout the series, and that legacy is kept up here. Where the story falters, the voice actors often revive it, and vice versa... it's a good collaboration. The scenes are routinely stolen by Daxter and / or the villains, who go above and beyond in their pursuit of a good reading that matches the circumstances, while Jak is kept fairly low-key and stoic. It's for the best, too, because on the few occasions where he does decide to go all macho and tries to spit out a line like ""let's go kill us some metal heads,"" it doesn't fit and he comes across as awkward and unsure.

Upon completing the second game, I likened it to The Empire Strikes Back, in that it took a fairly light-hearted series and transformed it into a more adult-oriented saga, with incredible results. For what it's worth, that Star Wars parallel carries over fairly accurately with this third chapter - you'll get lots of warm fuzzies at the end, and it's not quite as weighty or substantial as the second chapter, but overall it's still a very entertaining experience with a cast of characters you can't help but love. The big action scenes are really done fabulously, and there's rarely a dull moment, but this game suffers from the unbelievable quality of the game that immediately preceded it."
3992,5,good
3993,5,"Meh. it looks good but the story starts off slow. still playing through it but I'm not really playing it all the time. just every now and then. They could have done way better. It's almost like they didn't know the PS4 was releasing.

Update: Never mind played through the game looks great, really great, the storyline is not as good though but I play just to awe at the graphics, Awesome game awesome machine"
3994,5,Great Amiibo It is a little smaller than I expected after seeing the Wolf Link Amiibo But still that great nintendo quality great for your Amiibo Collector or Animal Crossing fan out there!!
3995,5,This game is one of favorite wish they can remake it for ps4 and Xbox one
3996,5,"I first got this game thinking it would be stupid.  I rented it from the library and after playing it, I loved it so much, I had to buy it.  I'm not even a super huge fan of Indiana Jones, but the game is so fun for any age and like any LEGO game, is adorable and funny.  If you're considering it, buy it!"
3997,5,pefect game old of course had to keep trying it over and over but works as expected and would buy more!!
3998,5,Everything he has gotten from you works great except one controller but it's no big deal he has three still!
3999,5,"The graphics are amazing, gameplay runs very smooth, and the new powers are awesome! Honestly I can say that this is the first TRUE next-gen game for the consoles. And Sucker Punch released an update of 19 bonus missions today (Day One) totaling about 5 more hours of gameplay, more computer character density and better graphic performance. If you were a fan of Infamous 1 and 2 you are not going to regret buying Second Son!

EDIT: In case anybody is wondering. I picked up Infamous Second Son at GameStop at midnight launch."
4000,5,need a AGES OF THE EMPIRE 4 !!!!!!!!!
4001,5,"I bought this system the other day because I have been putting off buying an Xbox360 for a while now.  This pushed me over the edge to buy it.  This system is free of flaws (red rings of death, overheating) and has an HDMI port to it.  I'm about to get an LCD HDTV so am loving having that option.  Also, this system is so quiet and runs so smoothly.  This is the same system as the normal premium only for the Halo fans.  The color scheme of this system is what made me want to buy it before I knew it was a Halo 3 system.  Buy this system if you're wanting a new XBOX or just love Halo that much."
4002,5,Purchased this as a Christmas present.  Was on his Christmas list.  He was very happy
4003,5,I purchased these cymbals to add to my existing Rock Band 2 drum set when I bought Rock Band 3. Adding these cymbals allows you to play the Pro Drums mode. I also bought a second pedal which can either be used as a High Hat or second bass drum pedal for double kicks. Easy setup and works fine.
4004,5,"I have flown X-Plane 9 since 2008 and loved it. All version upgrades until X-Plane 10 are free. X-Plane 10 has just recently been released. I have purchased three sets of XP9, the first as mentioned, then one for my brother so we could fly online together and this set for myself in order to set up a copilot station on a second computer. My brother has had several problems, one on installation and then issues with the graphics. This particular iteration would not install at all. I suspect it to be corrupt since the program asked for X-Plane 10 disc 1 to be installed and would not continue. Numerous attempts, even with a downloaded installer failed. X-plane has been notified and Amazon as always has made sure I'm happy with my purchses."
4005,5,Just the the standard black contoller but with advance warfare design.
4006,5,"A great game that my eight year old granddaughter and I play on the Wii. We play many games together but this is definitely a favorite!! If you play with a special someone, you might have this as a favorite also!!"
4007,5,"This game was purchased for my husband and he has been playing for weeks now! We have a rule in the house about no violent games around our 4 children so this is a perfect game for husbands bed time on his laptop. I have to say I enjoy watching him play, though if I fall asleep while he is playing the sounds of zombies can make for some interesting dreams.

 The game seems long to me and I love that about it, some other games are just too quick to play through. As he plays through it, the game also gets harder with new monsters and challenges. The story line is interesting enough to me to ask him about it and him to catch me up on what ever I missed. I am glad I got this for him, great gift!"
4008,5,Buying at Amazon it's just perfect. The delivery is incredibly fast and safe. FIFA 15 is gourgeous and the best soccer game i played so far. Very good.
4009,5,I love it I love it I love it I love it that is all I can say is that I love it
4010,5,Cool game
4011,5,"Work great, no problems"
4012,5,This game a gift for my daughter for Christmas  which she loves. Would buy again.
4013,5,Awesome controller! This definitely is a big nostalgic trip for me to the old PS1 days so I absolutely had to get this. I absolutely love the PS4 controllers... they're very comfortable and feel heavy/durable. Not much else to say - can't recommend it enough!
4014,5,"I love all the customization it has with the software.  It's pretty easy to learn and to get used to.  I like that it's has the ability to change layout based on .exe that's opened, so once I open a specific game, the layout for it changes accordingly with whatever changes I want.  Keys feel great, red is very sensitive, but not too bad, but I'll get used to all the misspellings.....  It does have more noise then I care for, but it's still not awful enough to take away a star or anything.  Better than the G15 it was replacing, I'm very satisfied."
4015,5,"If you think that Kingdom Hearts is stupid just because it has Disney characters in it, you are seriously mistaken my friend.  THIS GAME RULES! The fighting system is pretty new for a square game, it takes RPG elements and combines them with a Zelda 64 style battle system.  And I'm lovin it.
  One of the coolest things about this game is that you get to see returning Final Fantasy characters such as Squall, Cloud, Tidus, Wakka, Selphie, Yuffie, Aeris, Cid, moogles and non other than Sephiroth (who is exclusive to the American version!).
The characters have had cool costume changes for the game and have been fitted with great voice actors.  Yes even Sephiroth's voice is awesome (Lance Bass plays him, and did a good job).
  If you are into RPG games, buy this.  If you are into adventure games, buy this.  No matter what, you will have fun.  It takes a good chunk out of your time too. (About 25+ hours if you get every secret and stuff) And your gonna wanna take yo.ur time to get every secret.  Because if you do, after the credits you are treated to a teaser trailer for Kingdom Hearts 2.
Dont wait.  Get this today."
4016,5,"Great system in a cool color with all the GoW games! Just wish it had a cool design on it to show it was the God of War bundle package PS3, but still a great system and amazing games."
4017,5,"Even though it shouldn't have to be said, this game is really good. Really good. If you ever played the first Halo, ""Halo: Combat Evolved"", then you should immediatly buy this sequel. You won't be dissapointed. My only complaint about this game is the missing Assault Rifle, but it was easy to get over because of the added in SMG. If you play Halo 2, I guarantee you won't ever be able to get enough of it. And just incase you do, I suggest you go buy a 360 and get Halo 3. Just trust me on this one, would I lie to you?"
4018,5,"This is my first side-button mouse. I was worried about accidentally pressing the side-buttons when picking up the mouse, but it's not an issue; they are firm enough to hold their position when I'm not trying to press them, yet they press easily when I do want to. I can't imagine a better way they could have been designed.

I've come to rely on these extra buttons in almost every game that I play, and really enjoy the convenience.

I've used Razer mice for years, and they ALL developed problems shortly after I purchased them; I'm happy to say that after several months of constant use, this Logitech is still functioning exactly as well as the day I purchased it. I will definitely continue to buy Logitech in the future.

Setup was quick and easy. The software for this mouse allows rebinding keys and changing the color scheme of the backlights, which is useful for keeping track of which profile you're using.

Tracking is accurate, shape is comfortable in my hand, and the pads glide smoothly over any mouse pad I use. Great mouse, highly recommend."
4019,5,No problems with this product. I did buy both the Go Plus and Go-tcha and I suggest you do too. When the go-tcha runs out of charge because I am unable to tell if it's at full charge. I can easily switch to my Go Plus when needed.
4020,5,I bought it to save the Gran Turismo 2 game on the PlayStation 2 and it worked as advertised.  It was worth getting.
4021,5,"Thousand Year Door is by far the best Mario RPG I've played. My son and I played it through together when he was maybe 7 or 8 years old and since then, we've played through again at least one or two more times. It was fun looking around and problem solving together. The battles (although sometimes repetitive) were fun and adding new skills and partners was great.

The graphics are great and storyline fun. The variety of puzzles is fun and seeing Mario putter around with his little clouds of dust behind him is comforting. There are things to do to increase the play time, solving problems in the trouble center, mini games, cooking and the dreaded Pit of 100 Trials.

A solid game that easily stands the test of time even after being out for 8 years. If you can get your hands on one, it plays on the old Game Cube system but also in the Wii, you will just need a classic controller to play through."
4022,5,"This is absolutely amazing! Prices have skyrocketed because this baby is now out of print. If you have one of these, you are blessed! I've paired it with the original Dualshock so you can see the difference."
4023,5,It was so fun to play this game! Everyone who likes role-playing or strategy games play this! So fun to play online because it's like taking different trails to get to the same place but your racing with other people. It took me about 10mins to figure out how to play.
4024,5,Very well developed game compared to the other ones. It's faster and has a different feeling from the others.
4025,5,"this is one of the best games ever from the saga and expecting the new one th mk10, hoping to come soon"
4026,5,"Im a HUGE fan of this story,have all the movies and books,even the pop up ones also a brilliant Alice In Wonderland Tattoo :) Waited and waited for this game and it was very much well worth the wait and the cash spent to get it. I am also a huge gamer,own many consoles and such. This is both a great twist on the classic tale as well as a video game itself,what a masterpiece. There is nothing I dislike about this game and nothing Id change about it. All the games I own and this game quickly made my all time top 20 list. Its very stunning visually and audiologically also very well polished. Its just downright amazing,If you're thinking about getting this-DONT rent it..OWN it. Im telling you,If you're a fan like me,You won't be dissapointed..even if you aren't a fan,Its very fun to play and will keep your interest."
4027,5,"all excellent , thank you very much"
4028,5,Son loves Pokemon anything!  And a DS game.....
4029,5,"I don't know what game some of these reviewers are playing. This is a five star game if there ever was one. The graphics are terrific, there are no bugs in the software, and gameplay is as good, if not better, than the original two Thief games. The game is also very long. You get a lot of entertainment for your dollar. A true masterpiece of a game. I hope Eidos doesn't wait five years to release the next Thief game."
4030,5,Love it! Not having to waste batteries all the time is great. I've tried many brands of rechargeable batteries but none have the play time this gives me and they are very expensive.
4031,5,"This is a great charging station. its looks awesome on my entertainment system, not only does the lighting look cool, its lets me know when my controllers are fully charged. great product"
4032,5,"This product meets all expectations that I needed.
I like the state as arrival at their destination. Brand new.
I recommend this game for its magnificent history, verbal content, sound, graphics and environment in which it develops. You should definitely play it.
RATING 100 points"
4033,5,"Alice.....Aloy went down the rabbit hole and did not disappoint. graphics and gameplay amazing, great storyline too."
4034,5,pop cap hidden object game at its best...I have played all of these and this is one of my all time favorites
4035,5,"I never considered myself a full-fledged gamer until this system came out. I work at Toys R Us so when they came in one day suddenly, i put on on hold and bought it after my shift off of impulse. I must say, it was well worth the money.

I havnt been able to turn it off since the day I got it. Although the graphics arnt up to 2007 standards the gameplay is awesome. The entire thing is all motion actiavated and the Wii sports is one of the best things about it. After a few rounds of baseball my shoulders began to ache.

Its a great game system also in the fact that it doesnt allow you to sit down and play games all day. You actually get up and do something. So now more being lazy I guess.

But overall, its an absolute awesome system and well worht the little bit of money that it costs. its good for everyone, even non-gamers as its easy to figure out with very few buttons on the remote to have to deal with."
4036,5,"Many reviews say they don't like the new game, but I think that is just because they want their hundreds of dollars of expansions back, and there is a little learning curve.  It's like when you buy a new computer with a new version of Windows.  Everyone hates the new Windows if they change anything except the way it looks.  The new game is much more realistic because you can multi-task, so you can eat and watch TV or eat and talk, etc.  Also, the character creation and customization is far superior.  There is nothing you can't change!  And it is very user-friendly, just click their face or body and drag it to the shape you want.  Sure, you lose your expansions, but you can always buy the new ones when they come out."
4037,5,great aftermarket replacement
4038,5,"I am very sceptical of Role Playing Games (RPGs). I only own one, that being Final Fantasy X. RPGs just take up too much time and are very boring, however I really liked this game. Kingdom Hearts isn't like any other RPG. It is a combination of a platformer like Spyro, Jack and Daxter, and an RPG. Together they produce a perfect game. The game is easily worth the money, because you can get over 50 hours of gameplay out of it. It's characters are a combination of Disney and Final Fantasy characters. All of the Disny characters have real voice acting done by the same people that did the voices in the game. Overall this is a must buy game with excellent graphics. Show your X-box friends what a real PS2 game is like."
4039,5,"fun product, delivered as promised"
4040,5,Great game. I am still pushing through it on my first character for a year now. Hours and hours of game play.
4041,5,Just as decribed. Grandson Loved it!
4042,5,"So I've been playing the Ys series since Ark of Napishtim for the PS2 and have loved the series since.  Got all the games including the SNES Wanderers of Ys and all the special editions for the PS2 and the lone DS remake of Ys 1 & 2.  So I know my games.  I didn't know that this game was coming out until last year and I was super excited for this game, and was even more crazy that the Silver Anniversary Edition was coming out too.  So on to the review:

Graphics:
Above average to me.  It still looks like it's updated PSP graphics, but the background and environments are extremely beautiful.  The character designs are good, but the 3D models aren't really ""fluid"" when you see them in cutscenes.  Other than that, the graphics are really good, but not amazing, especially for a PSVita game.

Sound/Music:
It's Ys.  The music is fantastic! The sound effects are great.  The voice acting isn't bad either too!  Don't say the game sucks because there isn't any JP voice option.  But the sounds/music is amazing.  Hell, I'm listening to the soundtrack cause it's that good!!

Battle system:
Great.  The battle system is basically a rehash of Ys Seven's battle system.  You have 3 characters in your party, each with a certain type of attack.  For example, Adol uses a sword, so he's a slash type.  Duren uses his fists, so he's a strike type.  And so on and so forth.  There is no jumping in the game, but you have a quick dodge in the game, and if you dodge at the right moment, you activate a flash dodge, which slows down time and helps you get a couple of quick attacks before time goes back to normal.  The same goes for blocking too.  Now, I'm playing this game on Nightmare mode...cause I'm stupid like that.  It's crazy hard, and I died on the first boss like 15 times, but that's because I was working on how to beat him (he kills me in like 4 hits so don't blame me for not trying hard).  The same goes for the enemies in the game.  They will dominate you easy if you don't take care in attacking them carefully.  Dodge and attack strategically and you'll be fine.  Anyways, great battle system, just very hard on Nightmare (like really freaking hard).

Story:
Excellent, for now.  I'm still about 3 hours into the game, but the story is pretty good right now.  The ""Memories"" of Celceta highly involve Adol, but that's all I'm gonna say for that.  The story is great so that's all.

All in all, this game is on level with Persona 4 Golden, but I'm glad that this system has another amazing JRPG in its arsenal.  The Silver Anniversary Edition is a great collector's item too as it has a cloth map, compass, 3-CD soundtrack spanning all of the Ys games, and Adol's Journal (aka an artbook).  For $20 more, this was worth the price.  Get this game, be dumb like me and put the game on Nightmare, and have serious fun!!!"
4043,5,"Works good, I use it for a sega saturn arcade stick. I don't notice any input lag."
4044,5,So far so good. Looks pretty slick and functions well. Only had a few days.
4045,5,"Now with MGS 4, having this is a must have, if you haven't played them before you can get all 3 games at a cheap price, just like DMC series. Even if you just want to have them for your collection."
4046,5,excelent
4047,5,"This game is definitively worth getting. Hours and hours of gameplay, great dlc packs, amazing graphics amd storyline."
4048,5,"I really like this xbox controller for pc gaming, very comfortable and it does the job perfectly!
couldn't ask for more."
4049,5,"I think it is important to know the reviewer's system specs, since it can easily influence the overall gaming experience of the user. So I'll start with that.

My System Specs:
Vista x64 Ultimate
Q6600 @ 2.93GHz
8GB RAM (2 x 4GB)
8800GT SSC (eVGA)
Soundblaster Xtreme Gamer series
Speakers: Logitech Z-5300e
24"" BenQ LCD monitor (Native resolution): 1920 x 1200
Game resolution: 1650 x 1050
Anti-aliasing: 4x
Input: Xbox360 controller

Incredible graphics, great sound effects, and overall gameplay makes this title a must for everyone who loves action and a little bit (or a lot in this case) of violence.

Right off the bat, you start with tons of action and as you build your character, you increase the number of moves and special powers that you won't get tired off. It's fast-paced and it'll make your palms drench in sweat, so have towels handy.

If a game comes on multiple platforms, my first choice is PC, hands down. In my eyes, PC has better graphics - if your system has enough power, you can play it at higher resolution with more detail compared to console counterparts.

I stayed up nights trying to beat this game. There are epic action-packed battles that will get your heart pounding. Depending on how smart you are, or your methodology, your missions may range from very easy to very hard. I ran into a tough mission at the end which I had to play over and over and over... I guess that's one thing to complain about. The difficulty range is too wide. But everything else makes up for it. I would love to play this game again, but I have only so much time in my hands... I have to move onto 'inFamous' and see if it's better than this... But this game definitely raised the bar for future PC games that I'll be playing!

Oh, and you'll get your money's worth by doing side missions... There's potential for a very long playtime."
4050,5,i love this game allot.
4051,5,Great game for a great price! Thanks so much!
4052,5,EXCELLENT GAME!
4053,5,"I've played the game since it was released.  At first it was frustrating.  The updates helped however, it still has some glitches.  I'm 60% finished.  I really enjoy this game.  I great up with an NES.  You had to blow on games to make them work.  I can live with the little glitches in the game.  The story is good and graphics are amazing, except for the frame rate issues."
4054,5,great
4055,5,Couldnt beat the price
4056,5,Great game thanks 
4057,5,"Excellent game, excellent graphics, I recommend this game!!"
4058,5,A worthy successor to Sonic's first venture into the 3D realm
4059,5,nice
4060,5,This game is super fun.  I've been playing it for several hours and am still enjoying it.  Lots of new Pokemon to find.
4061,5,"We have been very pleased with Wii Ski & Snowboard.  It's a simple game to learn and easy for all three of our kids to play (ages 5, 7, & 10).  The tutorial is well done, so that even our non-reading 5 year old quickly figured out how the controls worked.  Additionally, it has several different play modes, from competitive races for our oldest to leisurely exploring for our middle child.

The two player mode is excellent!!!!  The screen is split and both players can ski independently of the other.  For example, our daughter likes to ride the lifts up and down and while the adult playing with her would like to ski.  That's no problem.  We ski and she rides lifts.  A wonderful feature for two players that might have different interests or when playing with an ADD child.

It uses the balance board, which means the kids are up and moving.  While it can easily be played with just the controller and nunchuck, the kids have more fun using the balance board.

There is one feature I do not like.  On the races, even if the player comes in second, it displays ""You Lose"" and the Mii is visibly upset.  It's a bit of a problem for younger children that don't like to lose.  It's a minor complaint, but we've had a few melt downs over second place finishes.

To only have the game a few weeks, it's gotten significant play time and does seem to be one that will get some pretty extensive play for the foreseeable future."
4062,5,cable was good
4063,5,great game grandsons loved it
4064,5,they were a gift the person i bought them for loves them.
4065,5,"THE GAME IS GREAT. I LOVE THAT YOU GET TO USE THE PEN MORE AND THE WATER
SETTING MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU I IN AM IN THE OCEAN.SONIC ROCKS."
4066,5,It came with all the cables and even a controller and works just fine. Thanks again to the seller I chose for this product.
4067,5,"A very enjoyable game. I'm a big Zelda fan (haven't played Dynasty Warriors). One thing I really enjoyed about the storyline part of this game is the team aspect. In the story, Link works as part of a team rather than as a loner. I actually would like to see more of this in the actual Zelda games because I liked it so much.

The art in this is great. I've always preferred the realistic looking Zelda games to the cartoonish ones. This game draws a lot from the realistic games (OOT, Twilight Princess, etc.) and very little from the cartoonish ones. I actually think it'd be neat for them to include characters/elements from those games but done in a realistic style, maybe in some future DLC. The gameplay is very fun, and as a non-expert player, I like that I can set it as easy as I want it to be (so that it's challenging enough for me to be fun, but not so challenging that I get frustrated and give up). I enjoy that you can keep unlocking weapons and such, so there's an aspect of gearing up that I'm used to from certain MMOs. As a WiiU game, they can expand it as they want, which is cool and leaves open the option for added content in the future. I already bought the downloadable packs, and it'd be cool to see more as time goes on.

I should note that this game does not have the puzzles like a normal Zelda game, nor is there the big, open world to run around in. It's a different sort of game, but I was surprised by how much I enjoy this style of game. And like I said, the graphics are great. I love link, and Sheik is very cool.  Some of the characters I'm not into playing so much, but it's nice that it has a lot of options because people like different things.

If you're a Zelda fan, try this out in a store demo if you can. That's what I did, and that's what convinced me to buy it."
4068,5,"seller said the sound didn't work, but it does with earbuds in (which is ok for then I don't disturb anyone sitting next to me) but it works amazingly and I love it."
4069,5,"Released for a handheld, I didn't have as high of expectation as original Resistance series, but after playing this, I have to say this is one of the better FPS I have played (especially on a handheld).

*************************************************************PROS***************************************************************************
-Gameplay: This has a very unique FPS gameplay. Very different than popular COD like FPS games. Different but great. Especially weapons.

-Weapons: Resistance weapons are the best aspect of Resistance FPS gameplay. Every weapon have a primary and secondary fire mode. These mode will include classic things like machinegun, shotguns to very cool and highly unique alien weaponry like tagged shots, auger shots (shoot through walls) and more.

-Story and timeline: This game takes place in an alternate timeline when chimera are invading the world in late 1900s. The environment it creates is very believable and story is pretty interesting with some degree of twist to it.

-Enemies and bosses: Filled with variety of enemies and also some very interesting bosses. Love the games with great boss fights.

*************************************************************CONS.***************************************************************************
-Handheld only: I would like to play this game on regular console. Considering how underrated this game is, it will also be good for this game if they were to release it on PS3 (and may be other consoles).

*************************************************************CONCLUSIONS***************************************************************
The whole resistance series is by far one of most underrated FPS games. I really wish Sony does more to promote these games in the future."
4070,5,"Perfect case for my 2ds XL. Fits many games and the charger too, making it great for storage and traveling."
4071,5,"THOR: GOD OF THUNDER for Wii is fun, fast paced, good looking and sounding and has controls that work well.  What more could you want?  Sometimes movie games don't turn out so great but THOR really shines on the Wii.  It's a 3rd person action adventure brawler that has three types of game play: exploring/fighting, arcade style flying rail-shooting and EPIC boss battles that end in snazzy quicktime events that actually deliver the goods.  You will play as THOR (obviously) and during the game you will find tons of unlockables, the coolest of which are different costumes that give the God of Thunder a look that suits you.  The combat is pretty much non-stop and requires some strategy.  You can't just mash buttons and expect to get through all the enemies since certain enemies require different types of attacks (wind, electrical) to be defeated.  As you smash everything in sight with your hammer you will also occasionally have to dismantle equipment and perform other tasks but they never become cumbersom or tedious and since you are constantly surrounded by enimies you will never become bored.  Fighting in this game is FUN.  The flying levels are extremely cool (think SIN AND PUNISHMENT)  and kept things varied and interesting.  The boss battles are truly epic (Satur and Mangog in particular) and you really have to fight with them and be quick to damage them, but once their health meter gets down the real fun starts.  This game has some of the best use of quicktime finishing moves I've seen.  When you are told to press a button or make a motion, the control actually responds acurately.  There wasn't a single time when I was left saying ""But I DID press the A button"" and I never had to start something over because of an unresponsive control scheme.  Everything about the controls of this game works perfectly and comfortably and it all feels very natural.

This is a quality affair all the way through.  Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as Thor and Loki respectively do a good job with the voice work and whoever did Odin pulled off a decent impression of Anthony Hopkins.  The graphics are vibrant, bursting with color and quite striking.  Some cut scenes are done in a still photo comic book style while others are fully animated and somehow it all comes together cohesively.  There ARE some frame rate issues but nothing so distracting that it will take away from your enjoyment of the game.  The orchestral music score is huge and swells to massive proportions during climactic boss fights.  The environments are interesting and fun, whether you are floating down rushing water on top of an iceburg battling seemingly endless enemies, or flying through the air shooting everything that comes your way, or putting out blazing fires with your cyclone move, from Asgard to Midgard it all looks pretty impressive (yes, Thor has some battles on earth and the timid cops are hilarious).

The game is a success as much for what it leaves out as what it includes.  THERE ARE NO tedious precision platforming levels that movie game designers seem to always fall back on and there are no puzzles (environmental or otherwise) to bring the action to a screeching halt.  This game is all action all the time and it manages to stay fun.  With all the norse rune symbols floating about I was really fearful that I would at some point be spinning some obscure dial trying to line up cryptic Norse alphabets but NO and THANK GOD!

The game is short.  The first time I played it through it took about six hours from start to finish (yep, I enjoyed it enough that I played it straight through).  My second play through (with the difficulty level up but all my character upgrades intact) took only three hours.  I'm fine with that but if you are looking for a long game, this one will disapoint you.  There is no option for any sort of multiplayer game either and no online play.  Too bad.
There are however a TON of unlockables and some of them are worth getting.  There is an entire episode of the animated AVENGERS series (featuring Thor and Loki naturally) as well as other goodies.  There is also a training mode.  As you complete each level it stays open and you can go to the ""WorldTree"" menu and play your favorite levels over any time you like (and find those treasures you missed the first time out).  The game also has a very slick and unobtrusive save feature and you will never have to replay a huge chunk of the level if you fail.  The game has a lot of violence of the very fantastical sort and is probably appropriate for all but the very youngest of kids.

This one is light years ahead of some of the other Marvel comics movie Wii games (the dreadful SPIDERMAN 3 and WOLVERINE with it's somewhat broken controls come to mind) and I'm really surprised at how well this turned out.
Hats off to SEGA/RedFly studios for putting together a game that can hold it's own with the best stuff out there for the Wii.  I was surprised by the quality of this game and I love it!"
4072,5,"I never thought I would give five stars to a game that involves probably 100+ hours of matching jewels on a grid, but this is very well thought out, and quite complex and large.  The designers have somehow created a system by which the player is constantly challenged in a series of puzzle-solving battles involving a fair amount of skill, but also a fair amount of luck.  As you advance, you open up new areas on the map, acquire new skills, collect tribute money from cities, build features onto your castle which enable you to collect new spells and skills, etc."
4073,5,"Great SF game.  It is a classic.

Nothing to add that the other reviews haven't said.

I would buy the new Super SF4 instead, if you don't have this one already."
4074,5,i love this game and i miss playing but the grappics suck tho wish they remake it for future system
4075,5,"I enjoyed the game very much, good graphics, puzzles were very challenging and fun.  I would buy other games from this vendor."
4076,5,Dunununununuh Rockman!
4077,5,"This was a surprise gift for my fiance.  Now in only one word, I can say he loved everything about it. Including the Disneyland Kinect game."
4078,5,"Like the title suggests, this game is just too good for words.  Graphics are flat-out THE BEST on any GBA game I have ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes on and the battle system is amazing.  The camera magic in this game goes beyond anything I've ever seen.  Not only does the camera work magic, but the intense, thought-out magic system deserves a review of its own.  I'm not gonna to ruin the game for you by blabbering on about the story (which might I add is a tad bit cliche) and rambling about the different weapons, all I'm gonna say is:  Get this game as soon as you possibly can!  It's a shame five stars is the highest rating....."
4079,5,"Awesome game, more bloody than usual Final Fantasy series, Awesome title!!!!"
4080,5,"Arrived in good timing and worked like a charm. It was easy to use and got the job done quickly. I used this to transfer games and files from a 20GB (xbox original 360 console) hard drive to a 250GB hard drive and I will surely use it when I'm ready to upgrade the memory again. If you want to transfer individual files you can choose which file you would like to transfer, however, once you transfer the files to another hard drive they are removed from the original hard drive and onto the new one. There isn't an option to copy the files. Maybe in a later version of this product they might include that feature. But either way this is good to have since it is reusable."
4081,5,Husband loves it and can't wait for Sun & Moon
4082,5,A little different from the PC version of the game. Instead of collecting resources and food you collect different types of resources to build structures. Still a nice Sims game and actually my favorite out of all the Sims series.
4083,5,"""I can't count the number of times i defeated this game. Literally one of the first games to hit the PS2, its another fun capcom beauty. Great Graphics and awesome game play back in 2002"""
4084,5,"I love ""survival horror"" games, from the ""Resident Evil"", ""Clock Tower"" and ""Silent Hill"" first offered on the Playstation to the latest incarnation found of the PS3 such as ""Dead Space"" and ""Bioshock"".

""BioShock"" is one of the best games I've found for the PS3. The gameplay is addictive and fun, the controls are easy to master, and the storyline is pretty unique. I'll avoid spoilers as to the why, who and what of ""BioShock"" as with most detailed games of this nature, watching the storyline unfold is half the fun. Rest assured that if you enjoy ""survival horror"" games like the ones I mentioned above, you'll like this game.

The gameplay is similar to that of the first couple ""Resident Evil"" games, as a player dropped into a wierd and hostile environment you have to solve puzzles, defend yourself against some nasty bad guys (and girls), pick up weapons, find diaries and clues, and best of all...explore your environment.

The world of ""BioShock"" is just pure eye candy...a city deep under the ocean. The graphics are beautiful...in a seriously creepy kind of way. One of the best things about owning a PS3 is the ""pop"" video game graphics now have...and ""BioShock"" maximizes that ""pop"", brining the underwater city to life. The soundtrack is simply amazing. Tunes from the 1930's and 1940's by The Inkspots and other vocal groups of that time add such a haunting tone to the game. They really do transport you to another world.

This game will give you hours of creepy fun, highly recommended."
4085,5,"Metroid Prime has, since the announcement that it would be first-person and in 3D, enjoyed the kind of controversial hype that only a first-party Nintendo game can enjoy. Once Nintendo announced that Retro Studios was going 3D with the title, it quickly joined the new Zelda in the ""What are they thinking?"" club. You (yes, you) most likely thought it would be ruined once it began to look more and more like a first-person shooter. You then read E3 impressions that said the game was good, but you probably didn't listen. Well, guess what, Mr. Smarty: Metroid Prime is good. Really good. While Prime's graphics lack a little polish and flair and the controls never really become second-nature, the game itself simply rules. If you're an old-school Metroid fanatic, you can skip the next paragraph or two as we explain the idea to the new folks. Metroid games have always been about exploration, secret areas, and collecting power-ups that are cleverly hidden in plain sight. You might see a door in the first room that you can't reach until much later in the game, and behind that door might lie an entire new set of rooms to discover. You'll do a lot of backtracking, but you'll do it with a purpose as you realize that the cliff that was too high to get to in the beginning is a piece of cake with your new Space Jump boots. Within a few structural limits, you have free reign of the place to come, see, and conquer as you will. As you play, the world unfolds before you, and you become the powerful warrior you need to be to end the threat that enfolds the world of Tallon IV. In the beginning, Metroid Prime suffers from its own expectations. Since it is a first-person game, you'll likely fumble around with the controls as you try to play the game like, say, TimeSplitters 2 or Halo. At some point, though, you'll realize that this is not Halo, and you'll adjust. When you do, you'll be surprised just how much like the old Metroids this game feels. You jump from platform to platform (always a pain in first-person games, but rather forgiving in Metroid), use your Ice Beam and Varia Suit, and fight the same enemies you remember from the older games in the series. Once you reach that point, you'll fall right back into the old Metroid groove, and it's all smooth sailing from there. There are a few minor problems with the game. First off, while the controls are great once you get used to them, the learning curve is pretty steep, and even once you know them pretty well, they never seem to feel natural. Ten hours into the game you'll still be accidentally firing missiles when you want to see the map, and the use of the triggers to look about and lock onto targets never feels completely right. Metroid's graphics are schizophrenic in a way; some minor details, like seeing Samus's eyes reflected in the visor in a bright glare, are spectacular, but others, like muddy shadows and simple enemies, are not. Lastly, Metroid Prime requires a lot of backtracking and going through places you've already seen, and that can get boring if you don't know where you're going. Hardcore Metroid players won't have a problem with that, but others might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over. Still, even with its minor problems, Samus's latest adventure is a perfect tribute to the Metroid we all know and love. Salute to Retro Studios and Nintendo for giving us the industry's Holy Grail-a next-gen game that significantly upgrades the genre while keeping all the classic feel of the original. Well done, folks, well done."

4093,5,"As with most games developed with the hand of Goshi Suda (51), No More Heroes is a very unique, strange, and one of a kind experience (not taking into account its sequel, obviously). No More Heroes, a story driven action/beat-em-up game, was released in early 08, and was met instantly with critical acclaim. The game ended up becoming Suda's most successful game to date (both critically and commercially), transcending a cult hit status and becoming one of Wii's ""go to"" games.

No More Heroes is about a man named Travis Touchdown, and his exploits to become the #1 ranked assassin. He must fight and kill the 10 ranked assassins above him. Playing to tradition Suda 51 style, the game is far from mainstream or ""normal"", using subtle (and not-so-subtle) sexual and oddball humor, interesting characters, and straight up weird situations and events.

The one thing that should be obvious by now is that No More Heroes is definitely not for everyone; the game may be very offensive to some, and the amount of violence, blood, and sexual content makes it not for those under the driving age.

The game consists of the player fighting his way through the top tier of the assassin world, meaning that you will be fighting several bosses (each boss is effectively one assassin in rank). And this is where the game is at its best. Each boss/assassin has an odd personality and/or backstory that makes the scenes before and after the fight VERY enjoyable and interesting. The actual fights themselves are some of the best designed moments in video game history, with interesting set pieces, locations, and weapons; one minute youll be fighting a magnum wielding detective at a base ball park, and the next youll be facing post-man in a movie studio.

Players progress in the game by killing the assassin/boss ranked above you (you start at 11). In order to have a chance to fight said assassin, players must play a variety of minigames to accumulate money needed to ""pay"" for the opportunity to fight. This  mandatory element of the game slows the pace and story, which is unfortunate considering the fact that the story is so well done and interesting. The minigames are odd, and include Travis mowing laws, collecting coconuts, or removing scorpions (all within a time limit of course). These mundane tasks are boring and earn you little money. Thankfully, however, this is not the only way to earn money. Early in the game, the ability to take on ""Assassination Missions"" opens. These ""missions"" are glorified battle arenas filled with ""fodder"", or simple, low level enemies, and is the fastest way to make money in game.

The game has you ""slashing"" at enemies (pressing ""A"") until they are weakened enough to be open for a finisher. Said finishers are what makes the gameplay so fun and satisfying. An icon indicating which motion to execute appears on screen, and when gestures are performed successfully, players get to ""slash"" the enemy in half with a fountain of blood and coins spewing forth. Wrestling moves are performed in the same fashion, and are just as satisfying. The controls are simple to learn and work amazingly well,but the game does have some ""hidden"" moves for more experienced games, such as the ""darkstep"".

No More Heroes is a diamond in the rough. Its extremely enjoyable and fun, yet lacks a serious level of polish. A boring and barren open world, technical issues, and less than inspiring graphics bring the game down quite a bit and may be enough to turn off some people altogether. But in the end, all that matters is the fun factor, and in that respect, the game succeeds. The simple and primitive finishers give the feeling of actually ""swinging"" the beam sword, and its that satisfaction, along with a funny and weird story line, that makes the game one of the best Ive played this generation."
4094,5,This is the best game I have ever played. I've finished it three times now and each time I took different approaches on how I played it. That makes it still interesting.

4097,5,"this GAme is da bomb. It will be my last GBA game. This game i heard u use cards to battle.  It is weird but what i heard it is still awesome.  It is arriving just be4 Christmas so i bet a lot of people will get this. The best thing about this game is probably because it is  continued from Kindom Hearts 1. I heard you can play as Sora's best friend. Yeah thats right i think u can play as Riku. If you saw the commercial you see Mickey and Kiku in black. I don't know what that means but i have a felling it is bad.

  I think that you need to beat Kindom Hearts 1 to understand this game. I am not sure if you need to. I am still wondering how GBA can have these graphics. They look so good in the commercial, but who knows. This game will rock believe me get this."
4098,5,"The first Gears of War remains one of the best games on the 360.  Gears 2 improvements may not be so obvious if you are not intimately familiar with the first.  Regardless, Gears 2 is an excellent game.  It's a must have if you are a fan of the first and a must have if you are a fan of shooters.  If you are not a fan of shooters, or at least 1st person shooters, then maybe you will find Gears of War more appealing as it is a 3rd person shooter.

Let me quickly recap what this game is.  Skip this paragraph if you are already familiar.  Gears of War is an over-the-shoulder shooter that heavily utilizes cover and dodge techniques.  You can take cover on just about anything and you can jump out of the way of attacks.  This, at the release of the first game, was quite innovative.  Only Rainbow Six Vegas had a similar cover system, but no dodge.  Since then other games like Dark Sector have taken on the Gears of Wars style gameplay.  Gears of War is a gritty and violent game -- not intended for children at all.  One of your guns has a chainsaw bayonet, for example (one of my favorite features by the way).  You can carry 2 large guns, a sidearm and grenades.  You are heavily armored and if take hits, you can retreat to cover to regain your stamina.  If you lose your stamina, you drop to the ground and crawl where you are prone to enemy finishing moves.  The enemy is a horde of humanoid creatures that live in the ground called Locust.  They employ all sorts of brutal techniques with the hopes of eliminating humanity from the world of Sera.

So, the game is a great improvement over the first.  There are a few new weapons, such as a flame thrower, a high caliber burst pistol, a large chain gun (that you don't have to drop your current weapon to use) and a mortar cannon.  The new weapons are great, and the mortar makes the first appearance in any game that I am aware of.  They implement it nicely too -- holding down the trigger for a duration to set the distance.  There is also the ability to use enemies as human/meat shields, and they also include a large metal shield that works similar to the meat shield.  These new additions on gameplay add greatly to the strategy involved in the game.

They also included more finishing moves that you can execute when your enemy is crawling along the ground.  Each gun has its own move. You can still curb stomp or you can climb on top and punch them to death.  And of course you can pick them up and use them as a meat shield.  Each of the face buttons on the controller are mapped to one of those 4 different finishing options.

As far as gameplay tweaks go, the cover system is vastly improved though it may be a subtle difference.  You can take cover on just about everything where as the first game it only worked on certain things.  Jumping in and out of cover is also more friendly.  Previously, the chainsaw kills were frustrating when 2 people went at eachother with the chainsaw.  Now, they included chainsaw duels where you have to rapidly tap the B button faster than your opponent.

Basically, the gameplay is nicely improved.  It's hard for me to think of way to improve it further.

The new multiplayer modes add tremendously to the replay value of the game.  My favorite new mode is Horde, where you take on wave after wave of increasingly difficult computer-controlled Locusts with up to 4 buddies or comparatively matched people on Live.  This is a feature that has long been lacking in shooters.  Tom Clancy games have terrorist hunt, but it's nothing like this.

There are of course the tried and true multiplayer matches like king of the hill and this and that.  Gears 2 certainly includes all of that, and I am very pleased with that as well.

I highly recommend this game."
4099,5,"You will have fun playing this game; especially if you play with other people.  The only downside is that with 3 or more people playing, the screen can get a little small which makes it hard (unless you have a giant TV).  Everyone should buy this game.  It's awesome."
4100,5,Great game but I miss the old guilty gear.
4101,5,"This Game is the PS2 sequel to the Xbox's Phantom Crash. I love both Mostly because these are seriouly involving and fun games.

SLAI offers mech fighting, arcade style with vast customization possibilities... And I mean VAAAAAAST. The difficulty curve in the beginning is a bit high but as you learn a few tips-n-tricks of the game, the fun involvement really keeps you playing and thinking... Even if you were to beat every stage and challenge alone it takes more than 50+ hrs. Right now I am at 209hrs since the beginning of summer but it is all fun hrs of play! The options and Stat ability growth would suck you back in! Online play is an absolute Blast! Destroyed? respawn and get your revenge and the most rivals shot destroyed by timer end.

Sadly. Konami is going to shut down the online server for this game on 10/01/2006 I believe it is mostly because this game is so good and no one knowa about it.... :(

Even so I still Highly reccommend this game."
4102,5,"I love this game! Super amazing RPG! Here is my review for Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 The Sith Lords. If you played the 1st game you will understand some of my refferences to past characters, if not I will still explain it anyways. I will also be makeing tons of refferences to the 1st game because I can explain how it's better or worst than the first game, So please enjoy my review! :)

Plot (minor spoilers only) Set 5 years after the 1st game ends and 4000 years before the Phantom Menace, Now the sith are ruled by no one. They are all in chaos, everyone is still recovering from the final battle of the 1st game. You are a (jedi guardian or sentinel or a councoler because you can choose what kind of jedi you are from the start) who is on the Ebon Hawk from the 1st game drifting in space after a massive attack. In the prologue (if you wish to choose to play) you control T3M4 (who also returns from the 1st game) an astromech droid like R2D2 cept he is flat headded instead of round. You fix up the ship and heal your made up character then take the ship to the mineing planet of  Peragus II. When you get to the planet you are in the med bay getting healed. When you start playing you find out that you, a scoundral and a old jedi master are the only ones alive on the whole planet. You find out that sith attacked the planet along with some other evil dooers and a sith lord. After you get off the planet you can start your adventure of destorying the sith and the sith lord who is trying to kill you and try to reunite the jedi or go full dark side and kill everyone and everything in your path.

Characters: (down below)

Main Character: You are known as the Exiled because the jedi kicked out of the order, why? You will need to play to find out. Anyways you can be a boy or a girl its an RPG so it lets you choose. At the begining you can choose to be a Jedi Guardian (aka the blue light jedi) who is a soilder who does more hand to hand or lightsaber to lightsaber combat. Or a Jedi Sentinel (aka the yellow lightsaber jedi) who relies on skill's and is a mediate between full combat and force useing combat. Or last you could be a Jedi Consular (the green saber jedi) who focus more on force powers to fight when in combat rather than fighting hand to hand combat. Because of the RPG of this game with interactions in the game you can choose to be either light side or dark side. Depending on how you play being either good or bad, the story can chage due to your side indiactor.

Kreia: is your jedi master. She is the 1st character you meet outside of the prologue. She is blind (litterly her eyes are all silver because she is blind. She is sorta a cranky jedi at times because when you become her student she wants to learn her way, to make everything and everyone you see as a tool for your advantage, that even means if stepping on your friends and them hateing you gets you further in life then take all advantage. She is jedi consular so she focus's more on force power fight but she can still fight with a light saber even tho she is blind. Because she is your jedi teacher she is pretty much the Bastila Shan of the 2nd game. Except in this game she really does teach you right from wrong because for example if you make a choice in the game she doesn't like or one she does like then she will break in mid conversation to either praise or scould you for you choice. Once this happens if she is your 3 man party if you continue to make the wrong soical choice of her liking she lose influcense in you and some questions will be harder for her to answer. (Influence will be explained later on down below) . Side chatting with her is fun at times because if you play your cards right you can increase your force points and your influences. Also she teaches you more force powers and so much more.

Atton Rand: is a smuggler who has kind of at attitude problems at times. He is a shooter so he can fight with blasters better. He was once a republic soilder then turned side to the sith then quit the sith to do this own thing, so he is the lone wolf to say the least. Side chatting with him you can lean his past if you have his influence high enough. If you do you can train him to be a jedi so you can have another jedi in your party to fight with you. He takes over the place of Carth Onasi from the 1st game. He is the pilot of the Ebon Hawk. His own special in the game is his feeling which I mean is that when he says the famous line ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" this means there is going to be some action/fighting up ahead so he is like a mini sensor for trouble.

T3M4: he is the astromech droid who returns from the 1st game. In this sequal game he is seriously upgraded in everyway, the programmers put in subtitles so you can understand every beep and boop he says unlike the 1st game where its litterly just says ""beep boop"" for every answer he has. Side chatting with him has also improved as well, you can talk to find out about what happened and sometimes he will make refferences from the 1st game. If you can get the influences high enough and if you have the repair skill to repair him enough he will show holograms of either Bastila or Carth talking about the Main Character in the 1st game and what happened after the final battle of the first game. T3 is really good at computers, repair, security and everything else that has to due with the intellegence skill. His special skill is being a work bench which means if he is in your party and you talk to him you can use him to upgrade all your weapons and armor that you have collected over the game. He can also make security spikes but won't after you have more than 10.

Bao-Dur: he is a technician who can repair all types of droids, he is accompanied by his tiny robot companion Remote who is a tiny floating orb who can repair droids if he is in your party with another droid present. Side talking with him is sort of boring, once you meet him you can pretty much go threw all of the dialouge choices very quickly. If you get his influence high enough he will ask you to train him in the way of the force to become a jedi guardian. Most of the time I left him alone because 99% of the time he is irrelevant as a playing character.

Go-To: pronouced go toe. He is a droid who is run by a man called Go-To. He is a crime lord who is trying to save the republic with the help of the exile (aka YOU) . Being a droid companion his special abilities are a self clokeing device which mean he can go invisable if he chooses, and he has a special droid attack which in only present of enemy droids will make them turn on eachother and have them fight eachother so you can save your time and energy. Side chatting with him is intresting to say the least, if you get your influences high enough you can find out about his past and how he became a crime lord and all. If you finnish certin planet missions he will give you 2000 credits per planet for either stablizing them or destablizing them.

HK-47: returning from the 1st game. He is the 2004 character of the year because of his personality, his use of insults of anyone who is not his current master, and his all around psychness. He is an assassin droid who when you first meet in the game he is broken and you must repair him. Once you do you can have all of his wickedness around you. Side chatting with him is fun, you can talk about destroying stuff and how to make enemies suffer. If you get influences high enough you can talk to him about his past where he makes refferences to Bastila and or Carth. Also in influence talking he can tell you on how to defeat jedi better with tactics that you wouldn't normally use to think of.

Mandalore: returning from the 1st game also. In the 1st game he went by the name Canderous Ordo who is a rough and tough Mandalorian. He is good at shooting or hand to hand combat. After the final battle in the 1st game he goes his seprate ways to reunite his clan. When you get him in your party he is really good at fighting. His special ability is haveing 4 seprate implants to make fighting better. He has regeneration so he can gain more health back quickly. A health booster so he has more health before hand. A strength booster to make him stronger in hand to hand combat and last he has a dexterity booster which can give his shooting ability a boost. Side chatting his him is alright. He doesn't have any special influence you need to worry about, everything comes out in normal conversation.

Visas Marr: She is a Miriluka which mean she is blind from birth but can see threw the force. Because she is force sensitive she is a jedi. Her planet is Katarr which was destroyed by her master Darth Nihilus. She is first met when she tries to kill you but defeating her causes her lightsaber to break and then she swears her loyalty to you. Her special skills are stealth so she can sneek around well. Along with her jedi powers she is a deicent fighter but I wouldn't put her in the front lines for a perfect offense. Side chatting with her will reveal that if your influences with her are high enough she can teach you force sight which mean you can see how she see. Her force sight ability has the power to show you the inner esscence of people, which mean you can be talking to people and if you use this power they could turn blue for lightside, red for darkside, or gray for netural and droids are 100% netural even if they have a good or evil tinge to them they show as netural.

Mira: She is a bounty hunter. You can only get her in your party if you are good aka blue side aka lightside at the end of one of the levels. If you are good and she joins you, she will be of great help. Her special ability is when she is leader of the 3 person party she can walk threw landmines and NOT set them off. She is the only one who can use her special wrist rocket launcher which can fire rockets and grnades. She is better at shooting then hand to hand combat. Side chatting with her can reavel her past and if influences are high enough she can be trained to be a jedi. Then when she can hold a lightsaber it is easier for her to fight hand to hand than with a blaster because she can use force powers as well.

Hanharr: He is a bounty hunter wookie. Same planet as Mira but you need to choose darkside to get him. He is a rage-a-holic wookie when in rage mode increases his strength so high he is an unstoppable hand to hand combat machine. His special abilty is wookie rage it is the base form of wookie frenzy and wookie fury, over all idea is that  his strength goes up by alot for 60 seconds and he is able to kick major ass with it. Side chatting with him is fun. You can learn about his past and how he became a bounty hunter. There is a glitch which sometimes does NOT work but if it does it can increase his intellegence to over 200 making him the smartest person in the game but this glitch sometimes fails so try at your own risk!

Mical aka Disciple: he can only be in your party if you have choosen female main character from the start. He is a historian and scienctist. He is a shooter when you first meet him but you can make him a hand to hand fighter. His special ability is a walking medical station, when you talk to him you can make any medicen you need if you have the skill and ingreaditents. Side chatting with him can reveal he is force sensative and you can train him to be a jedi. Then he can have the ability to meditate with you. He can also heal you for free in chat because he double's as a medic of the team.

Handmaiden aka the last handmaiden: she can only be in your party if you choose male main character from the start. She is an Echani fighter, so she is great at hand to hand combat. In the guide book it calls her the perfect body guard. Her special ability is echani fighting which can give her a stronger hand to hand combat sense. Side chatting with her is fun, she can train you in the art of echani fighting so you can be stronger at hand to hand combat as well. If you influence her enough and win enough sparing matches you can train her to be a jedi guardien so she can even better at fighting with a lightsaber and all.

now we move on to attributes, skills and leveling and Influenceing.

Strength: this tells how physcially strong you are, the higher it is the strong you hand to hand combat is while fighting with a sword or lightsaber.

Dexterity: this tells how fast your reflexs are, the higher they are the more you can dodge and it corrasonds with blasters and shooting battles because you can shoot more accurately and faster with a higher DEX

Constitution: is how much health you have, the higher this one is determins how much health you have. Also it makes your character harder to poison or other non physical attacks to harm your character. Also the higher constitution is says what level implant you can have, it starts from a basic level 12 CON implant to the highest of a level 18 CON implant.

Wisdom: determins how much force points you have to spend in battle or other force powers you may use. The higher this is the more you are able to resist force attacks from enemies.

Intelligence: determins how smart you character is, the higher this is will give you skill points so you can have a higher skill to use the game. Sometimes this gives you additional dialogue options when talking to other characters.

Charisma: yes it does increase you speech skill but over all it effect your force powers. The higher charisma is the harder your force powers can hit an oppoent. Also if you use an oppositie force power for instace say you are a dark jedi trying to use a lightside power, the cost per use will be less with a higher charisma.

Skills:

Computers: this tells how well you can work on a computer, the higher this is the less spikes you need to hack into a computer. In work bench you can create Lightsaber power cells and some lens with this. You can also make some armor and weapons upgrades with this skill too.

Repair: this is for reparing, the higher this is the less parts you need to fix something in the game, this includes droids that might be hurt in your party if you try to repair them your self. In work bench you can make emitters and some armor and weapons upgrads too

Persuade: is how well you can talk to others in the game, the higher this is the more likely you can talk a better reward out of people or get out of a sticky situation.

Security: this determins how well you can pick a lock. The higher it is the less spikes you need to pick a lock. This skill in work bench can be used to make lightsaber, armor and weapons upgrades.

Awareness: how well you can look around. Spoting people who are lieing to you in conversation or seeing hidden objects for the taking. This skill can be used in work bench for lightsaber, armor and weapons upgrades.

Treat Injury: this skill is self explanitory, the higher it is the less med packs you need to heal your self. Also in work bench you can make some armor upgrades but this skill works best in med lab where you can make tons of medical items you would ever need.

Demolition: how well you work on explosives. Landmines can be disabled and taken with a high enough skill, also  this can be used in work bench for armor, weapons and lightsaber upgrades. Also it can be used in med lab to make landmines and grnades for your use in battle.

Leveling: In the sequal the level capping has been upgrade from 20 to 50. Most of the time you won't ever get up to level 50 unless you use the level glitch. But now you have a longer chance to be a jedi because in Kotor 1, you could only become a jedi when you reached the 3rd world/level of the game, by then you are either a level 8 or 10 character, then you would only have 10 to 12 levels to master being a jedi. But when you start the game from the start you are a jedi already with force abilities so you can start doing force powers from level 1.

Influenceing: In the game some speech checks are going to need influence, This is only for the characters in your party. It starts off as netural, but it can go either influence gained or loss, If you gain more it makes each character in your party easier to talk to, same goes for loss of influence. But sometimes in side chatting with certin characters if you don't have enough influence you cant progross on with the conversation. Its NOT important to the main story line but sometimes having a high influence with other party members you can learn new abilities you couldn't befor, or learn something secret about the characters past or learn new fighting tactics that you will never learn unless you have high enough influence.

Now its time to talk about armor and weapons and upgrades and force powers and other misc things in the game.

Armor: is split into light, medium and heavy. The heavier the armor the better the protection is. In the game there is  78 different types of armor including jedi robes. So you will have tons of choices if you are able find, buy or get the armors. Some armors restric jedi force powers but the robes do NOT so robes rock!

Armor upgrades: are so very much improved over the fist Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic. For a quick recap in the 1st game  there were only 2 upgrades but you could NOT choose what you wanted to upgrade it was predetired what your armor would get upgraded. In KOTOR 2 here you can choose what you want to upgrade and how you upgrade. If you want more defense you can have that. If you want an upgrade with a health regerator you can now. There is over 60 choices between armor upgrades, if you have the skill to make them in work bench you can use them. 60 upgrades to mix and match as you choose compared to the 1st game of 2 with no choice in how you upgrade it.

Blasters: in this game there are 66 different blaster pistols and riffles to choose from. In the 1st game there was only 25, so here in KOTOR 2 you are litterly getting doubled and them some of blaster pistols and riffles choices to choose from.

Blaster Upgrades: Once again KOTOR 2 is a vast upgrade, in here you get 45 blaster upgrade choices you can make to mix and match how you want. In the 1st game you had 4 different parts to upgrade but you could not choose how you were to upgrade it, the upgrades came predetermined for you. Now in this game there are only 3 parts to upgrade, sure one less part to upgrade but now you get 45 choices and you can choose how and what you upgrade, more power? sure, more accuracy? yup you can do that. Plus in the 1st game you could only upgrade only 7 blasters out of the 25 in Kotor 1. Now in Kotor 2 you can upgrade pretty much all 66 blasters you come across.

Melee weapons: The non lightsabers, in Kotor 2 there are 25 blades you can fight with. Its the same amount in Kotor 1 but where the differences lie are in the upgrades.

Melee upgrades: In Kotor 1 you could only upgrade 6 blades with 3 choices of upgrades that are once again predetermined for you, In Kotor 2 you can mix and match your upgrades on how you want them to be.

Lightsabers: They have the same as Kotor 1 but upgrading is where the differences are.

Lightsaber upgrades: all lightsabers can be upgraded but in Kotor 1 you could only change the color of the blade and have 2 power crystals. Now in Kotor 2 you can change the color of the blade, have 2 power crystals and now you have have a power cell for more damage, a lens to focus the sabers power more and have an emitter for better protection, to which you can mix and match upgrades as you choose.

Lightsaber fighting forms: in the 1st kotor you could only fight one style, one vs many enemies. Now in Kotor 2 you can choose and learn up to all 7 forms, from fighting one vs many, to one on one, to one vs one with an lightsaber, to one vs blasters and more.

Force Powers: you have the same base force powers as Kotor 1 cept now they added more, higher levels. New powers, like revive which is if you are the last one standing in your party and you use this power it brings your party back from the dead to keep on fighting. Or if you remember from the 1st game, Bastila had Battle meditiation which can make your allies stronger in battle and weaken your enemies, now in Kotor 2 you can use that power and more than Kotor 1 never ever had. You can even learn some people from other jedi's in speech talking.

Implants: you can do more with implants now, instead of useing a fleat power to get them you now need consitution, but if you have a level 18 consitution you have all the implants. In Kotor 1 you only had a few types, In Kotor 2 you have many levels, from 12, 14, 16, and 18. Level 18 has the best, improving your main attributes and others, as well skills and other usefull techinquies you can use

Random Loot Generator: it depends on how high your level is. The higher your level is the more high level stuff you can find on people. Sure sometimes it sucks and sometimes its good, it all depends on how high your levels are.

Time to talk about the pro's and con's of it all.

Story Pro: to me it is more expanded than in Kotor 1 because you can go to more planets, do more things, have a cooler story line. New and old returning characters from the 1st game but they expanded it more in this game.

Story Con: YES this game is cut. Im not going to sit here and tell you that everything is included because its not, the developers who made this game cut it quickly because they wanted to get this game for the holiday season. Some parts of speech are cut off you can tell that some characters in your party like Bao-Dur had more to say but didn't so they cut some of his speech out. Some other parts in the game were cut but if you are playing this for the very first time ever, you can NOT tell anything was cut at all. I certinally could not untill I saw that online alot of people were saying there were some things taken out from the game.

Character over all: The party characters you travel with have upgraded in speach and talking, you can talk so much more and use them all in your party more in the game. I like what they did with their characters. Also that every human companion and Bao-Dur who is Zabrack can all be trained to be a jedi if they are not a jedi already. Who doesn't want more jedi's? In Kotor 1 out of all 9 character beside your character you only had 2 to 3 jedi's to choose from. Now in this game out of the 12 characters you have cept for Mandalore, the droids and if you went dark side hanharr the wookie, everyone in your whole party can be trained to be a jedi and fight with lightsabers and force powers. Vast improvement from the 1st game

Items and Upgradeing pros: this has been the biggest thing I knowticed in the whole game. From playing the 1st game then going straight to this game I can feel how much I can mix, match and choose up upgrades I want with what armor and weapons I want.

Item Cons: As I said before that some stuff was cut from the game, some of the small armor and robes and only 2 lightsabers were cut from the items here.

Over all: I like this game way more than the 1st in pretty much everyway possible, even with the cuts the developers had in this game it is honestly so much better than Kotor 1, But that is just my and only my oppion here. I hope you enjoy this game!!"
4103,5,"Looking back, Kirby 64 had its shortcoming after I finished the game. However, playing it again was worth my interest. This game have more copy abilities to mix-and-match your combination, new planets to explore, and a balance difficulty to keep the edge of your seat. Also, the mini-games for the multiplayer are fun for taking a break from the single-player experience.

Overall, it is my favorite Kirby game of all time. Young and long-time fans are highly recommend to give this game a chance."
4104,5,"good deal, good product, will use this seller again"
4105,5,I am a huge fan of hack n slash games and this is up there with the best of them like devil may cry games.
4106,5,"Wow!  It has the simplicity of tic-tac-toe and the complexity of playing multiple chess matches simultaneously.  The first couple times I played was without a headset.  Even with the headset on the first few times I thought it was going to be too difficult to play and enjoy.  There is a steep learning curve but the basics can be conquered in a few days of playing it.

I started with the solo-game.  The first section which is about nine battles is also a tutorial.  It teaches you the basics of the game.  You have to learn what each unit does and how best to use them in battle to achieve your objectives.  You also have to learn how to get them to do what you want them to do.  That's where voice control comes in.

Once you get beyond the ""Prelude to War"" missions you then begin battling for World domination.  You are presented with a global map and each of the three factions US/Europe/Russia battle each turn for control of more territory.  You choose which ""City"" of territory to go after or you can defend one of your ""cities"" from attack.  My first choice was to battle the European forces that had gained control of a city in Florida.  At the end of my battle win or lose the system will show you the ""new"" global map; who now controls what.

The objectives of each mission so far have been one of two things.  You either attack or defend by destroying ALL the hostile forces or gaining control of more uplinks and holding them until the timer expires. That's the tic-tac-toe of it.  If there are nine uplinks you have to control 5 then hold til the timer expires to win.  You decide which units to bring to the battle.  You decide which uplinks to go after and in what order.  You decide which reinforcements to call up during the battle.  That's the multi-chess part of it.  It gets hot and heavy and very dynamic.  You are continually assessing the situation, ordering units movements and actions, monitoring battles, extracting units to fight another day, ordering specific reinforcements and on and on, during the battle.

One of the key elements is your command vehichle.  Without one you cannot have a satellite view of the battle field; which is the easiest way to command and control your units and know where the enemy is.  I lost mine during a battle and lost the battle.  I felt blind as a bat.

An uplink is a bunker that is used as a place to be controlled to achieve victory.  It can be upgraded to help you use your advanced skills (Airstrikes, Electronic Warefare, etc...).  My strategy to date has been to capture the most centrally located uplink and use it as a springboard to capture other uplinks.  I'll station my artillery there because usually they can reach hostiles closing in on the other uplinks (tic-tac-toe).  The battle can be and is most successfully fought using the satellite view aka sitrep.

There is so much to like about this game.  If you like War games and Real-time-Strategy games, you are going to LOVE this one.  I am already thoroughly enjoying it and I've still got tons to learn.

One last thing I enjoy.  You can get a mission brief before each battle.  Pay attention to your intell and objectives.  What you have to accomplish and what the opposition is going to throw at you should dictate your tactics and what units you bring to the battle.  Also when you transition to the WWIII phase you get to decide what your Battalion consists of from a choice of Battalion types.  Airborne has more air units, Tactical has more Tanks, Assault is more balanced and is what I chose.  You can also upgrade your units from the currency you earn in battle.  You get graded on each mission and earn credits to be used to upgrade.

I have not played online in the ""Theater of War"" mode yet.  Trying to hone my skills cause I'm thinking the competition is going to be tough online.

Really fun game!"
4107,5,"This is one of my favorite FPS's of all time. It stands right alongside Halo, and Battlefield 1942. The single player missions are done wonderfully, the enviroments are great, and the multiplayer is the best I have ever played.

BUY THIS!"
4108,5,More playable than halo mcc
4109,5,"OK, first thing's first: if you want a racing game that you can just throw into your Dreamcast and play for a short time every now and then, you'd be better off going for something like Ferrari F355 Challenge or Rush 2049. This game is very involving, and you must expect to spend a long time working your way through it if you want to be successful. While casual gamers are treated to 'quick race' and 'time attack' modes, the bulk of the game lies in the championship mode, which requires a lot of time and effort to conquer. Buying the game just for it's 'single race' mode is like buying a Ferrari just for the comfy seats!
You start off with a little amount of money, then you gradually earn money and cars by winning races and special challenges. You might assume that the game doesn't get interesting until you've acquired the Dodge Viper and souped it up, but this is not the case. The fast cars are almost impossible to control on the very difficult courses, so you would be better to use a slightly less powerful car. Of course there are fast tracks where you can be a speed demon, so choosing the right car for the track is important. There are four classes of car based on their engine displacement: Extra, B, A and SA class. At the start of the game you will have to pass tests to earn each license. There are about 24 license tests, all from different manufacturers; if you can beat the current record for each license track, you will win a special 'works car' from that manufacturer. However, you are as likely to win all of these as you are to land on the moon tomorrow. The license tests are easy to pass, but to win the works cars is near-impossible, and will take you a LONG time. This isn't a negative aspect mind you, I enjoy the fact that the game offers so much to do and will keep you playing for months.
If you win every race/challenge in the championship mode (of which there are a lot) you will unlock a new mode called 'world speed king'. I can't say much about this though, as I'm a LONG way from seeing it!
The control in the game is superb; each one of the 130+ cars handle just as you would expect them to, and tweaking them in the garage makes a noticable difference to the way they perform. Arcade-style-racing fans will find the controls far too twitchy and unstable; this is definitely aimed at simulation fans although the controls can be configured to suit your liking, including steering sensitivity. I have used both the Dreamcast controller and the Madcatz MC2 Racing Wheel, and both worked excellently. For the ultimate experience however, I have got to recommend the racing wheel and pedals - you won't believe how realistically at handles the cars.
Although you probably can get through the game without too much mechanical tweaking, you will find it much easier to invest a little time in learning what you need to do to improve your performance. Practically EVERYTHING is adjustable and replaceable, from the wheel base distance to the gear ratios, and you can buy plenty of parts, from $2,600 aluminium hubcaps to $80,000 turbo engine makeovers.
Unfortunately there is no online multiplayer option, but you can play with two players using a split screen. You can also connect to the internet to get tips from the Sega GT website (which is, unfortunately, rarely updated) and also register your best lap times - however, don't expect to see your name at the top unless you are prepared to lose all your spare time trying to shave off 2 seconds from your already perfect lap!
The graphics are beautiful, there is hardly any draw-in and the frame rate never slows down. The cars are stunningly rendered. Cars are offered from the usual predictable manufacturers, including Toyota, Dodge, Ford, Honda and Mazda. The selection of cars is more than sufficient; I have heard people complain that there aren't enough, but trust me, 130 is plenty. Especially since you can build your own from scratch, and this is where the game gets really interesting.
The 'Carrozerria' allows you to build your very own car however you want it, with 2 million different combinations possible. At first you can only build E-Class cars (with a displacement less than 1000cc). To build better and faster cars you will have to pass a series of tough tests in the car you have made. Persevere long enough and you can soon be building 5000cc, 3000hp (yes, you read right) monsters. You will have to build your own cars to enter some of the races in the championship mode, most of which have restrictions on what you can race in. Build as many cars as you like, and if they turn out to be substandard, well then you can always sell them to some sucker in the 'car dealer' option as a 'limited edition concept car'. ;-)  Each car does handle differently depending on how you choose to build it and modify it, and it will take a lot of experimentation for you to get it just right. You can save your cars onto your VMU to rave your friends, which is a nice feature. The game also offers a mini-game for the VMU (which takes up 128 blocks), and you can earn cash and unlock special cars for use in the main game, though if you aren't interested in that then you won't be at a disadvantage. Still, it's a nice little bonus to keep you occupied while you're away from the Dreamcast. The main game uses 42 blocks for its save game file.
The biggest drawback about this game is its lack of any damage modeling whatsoever. So, when you crash your brand new Dodge Viper head-on into a wall at 250mph, you won't even scratch the paintwork. You can just carry on as if nothing happened, with just a little rumble on the jump pack to indicate you hit something. This can distract you from the realness of the game very quickly, and that is something no game should do. Given the sheer depth of gameplay though, it is just about forgivable. It would also have been nice to be able to race more than just 5 other cars, but you can't have it all... The menu interface is quite clumsy and can quickly get tedious, but you just have to put up with it. By the way, if you select the 'Internet' option from the main menu, PLEASE remember to save your game beforehand or you lose everything you've done in the previous session. Unfortunately the manual has no mention of this - I learned the hard way!
Generally, this is one of the best racers available for the Dreamcast and if you are someone who likes to get really involved in a game then you will love this. However, others need not apply.
I would give this 4 and a half stars, but since it is so damn impressive in most respects I'll bump it up to a 5...."
4110,5,It's a lego game!
4111,5,"I have yet to be upset with any Amiibo purchase and this one holds up to that and then some. The details are simply amazing for it, not to mention how fun it's functionality adds to the games it connects to!"
4112,5,perfect
4113,5,Everything that I have seen about this DLC tells me it is the Bees' Knees. Here is my question: why pay $29.99 for it here when it is 800 MS points or $10 to download it from Xboxlive???
4114,5,"I liked this game when I was a kid, still do."
4115,5,Item as described
4116,5,Excelente!
4117,5,Awesome game
4118,5,"Especially if you have the balance board, this is one of the best workouts for the WII you can get."
4119,5,This is awesome. I have friends coming over just to play the games affiliated with the Wii racing wheel. The only thing I would love to add is that it is rubber vs. the plastic!! I will definitely wear this out!!
4120,5,"Our original disk got fried when my son left it on top of his Xbox 360, and I searched all the local shops for just the game since we have all the figures that still work. Nobody carries just the game minus the figures. I refused to repurchase the starter set again and this was perfect. The game was new, no scratches, smudges, etc. It was well protected for shipping and came in a timely manner. My boys were thrilled to be able to finish their game and unlock some new levels with the new figures they got for Christmas."
4121,5,Fun game to play!
4122,5,A very noticeable difference from the original analog cables. I would say worth the money for these cables.
4123,5,"This was perfect for my psp, it came in a box and looks as clear as glass and didn't have any scratches on it."
4124,5,"Disc has some small scratches, but works perfectly."
4125,5,"i got what was described, the game is retro and fun. i would recommend this game for anyone to play!"
4126,5,"Peggle is a fun casual game. It's very straightforward. Aim for the orange pegs. Hit the green ones to get various power ups that change every few levels. The power ups are all very different and keep things interesting. Some are not as useful as others like the lobster claw flippers. Each power up makes you think differently about how to approach a level.

As straightforward as the gameplay is, Peggle isn't simple. You only have 10 moves to clear all the orange pegs and it's difficult to predict just where your ball may bounce at times. Most of the time the results are what you aim for, but sometimes the judging an angle slightly wrong can turn into a wasted ball. Other times, you might just get a layout that works against you. While the design is always the same, the placement of orange pegs varies. But that's the challenge of Peggle.

There are 55 levels in the game, so plenty to play through. You can always replay levels of your choice later outside of story mode to try your hand at clearing the entire playing field of all blocks.

I wouldn't really consider Peggle a largely re-playable game. I played through story mode twice on a non-Steam version of the game, and playing through again on Steam didn't really hold my interest. But I would definitely consider this a great game for at least one or two playthroughs that is worth it's price point.

The only negative aspect of this game is the resolution, which is low and doesn't stretch to fit widescreen monitors."
4127,5,"Halo is the best shooter ever. Awsome graphics and a nice plot. You are the master chief, one person who destroys the covenant and the flood. I play it almost every day with my sister and my friends. We play co-op and multiplayer. We have fun with both of these!!!! If you're looking for a good game for xbox, well this is the game you want to spend your money on!!!!"
4128,5,"This is a review for the Japanese version of the Mii Sword Fighter amiibo.

I love it! You can actually set a Computer to be a Mii, and have the full challenge of a amiibo! I'm bought several of these to make my Mii Army of amiibos!

I definitely recommend you get one right away!

P.S. Every amiibo will look the same, so if you want to make sure you can tell them apart, put a small identity sticker on the bottom."
4129,5,Very good product.
4130,5,This game was amazing when the original came out it was only made better with the revamped graphics. Definitely a good addition to my collection.
4131,5,"Awesome! Love it, fast and timeley delivery!"
4132,5,"Classic, and harder to get dirty than the white controller."
4133,5,I played the game awhile back and was a bit skeptical but now I've decided to give it another shot I rated it 5 stars because the seller ocean reef sent it to me very quickly and sold it for a reasonable price very satisfied with my purchase
4134,5,"This is an amazing game. It is way better then call of duty 4, or call of duty 5.
Here are reasons why

Campaign
Campaign mode is much longer and more fun then in call of duty. The maps are a lot bigger, and are much more creative. And the story line  is much better. And unlike call of duty, bad company is funny, not glumly and depressing. And there is so much more you can do. For example: If you can't find a good door to enter a building through, make your own. You can destroy almost anything in the game. This also applies for multiplayer mode.
yo
Weapons
Although most of the weapons are one that are also in call of duty, they are so much easier to get. You start out with a grenade launcher, and other special weapons such as rocket launchers and c4 you find very often.

Health
The way health works is very different between bad company and cod4/5. In bad co, you start out with a certain amount of health, and it goes down with damage. However, you can quickly heal yourself to maximum health with a quick shot. In call of duty, you have to wait until you heal automatically.

Graphics: The graphics quality is almost equal. If there is a difference, it is not noticeable.

Vehicles: In bad co, you get to drive vehicles very often. This includes trucks, tanks, and helicopters. In call of duty you cannot use vehicles, other than the very rare time you get to ride in a tank.

Price: Currently, call of duty 4/5 costs about $50. Bad company costs $20 dollars. Need i say more?

In conclusion, battlefield bad company is better then call of duty in almost every way. And it costs less than half of what call of duty costs. Campaign mode will keep you entertained for many days. And when you finally beat it, multiplayer mode will entertain you for several more months. All for $20. So why are you still reading this? GET THE GAME!!!!!!!!"
4135,5,just as described!
4136,5,Works really well
4137,5,Excellent. Absolutely love it. Can't stop playing.
4138,5,"Update 1/6/2012

Actually beat the game for real.  Took about 18 hours and I completed every available quest and crab fished a lot.  It was overall a pretty easy game.  Didn't see game over not one time.  There were a couple of times where I did find a bit of a challenge, but these moments were rare.  Upon beating the game you can do some extra quests that open up and a few have some increased difficulty.  But nothing really stand out.  Due to the limited nature of the game (powering up your robot involves expanding slots with P Crystals and buying/finding different shaped parts), there isn't much else to do except fill up the log book to open some new reading info and find all of the music, theater pieces, and such.  But upgrading the robo is somewhat bland.  Especially since you can own up on most every baddie with a lightly upgraded robo.

-----------------------------------

Update 12/27 with slight spoilers!!!!!

So I thought I beat the game and was thinking 'what a piece of crap - only 10 hours!?!?!?!?!? But that's only the halfway point luckily. Those places mentioned in the instruction manual: Pharaoh, Mau, and others can and will be visited in time. You will be able to complete the additional content. Phew! Sorry about the spoiler there, but I'm just saving you from tossing the game away in disgust. Just wait through the credits and the second half will begin. And the difficulty does jump up a bit. Though in a more unfair way! They seem to just throw more enemies at you at once. Which makes it tougher. But you will acquire some amazing new skills that will pretty much even the difficulty out again. But the story gets a dramatic improvement as we start to delve into Red's past and unravel the secrets of this strange world.

-----------------------------

Despite the low difficulty setting and somewhat repetitive battles and tasks, this is easily one of the best games ever released on the Nintendo DS. I own over 40 RPGs for the system, and none of them really gripped me quite as quickly as this title.

You are Red, basically a jack of all trades. You have an amazingly cute and frustrated companion Chocolat (love her frustrated noises) and a robot called Dahak. The world is amazingly original and inventive. It looks and feels like something from a Miyazaki film (Castle in the Sky comes to mind). The graphics push the limit of the DS hardware and it is just a joy to look at. The graphics are the 2d - 3d style and the camera does move, but you don't control it. Makes it interesting though for hidden items and puzzling areas.

The music is equally high quality. We're talking on a level with Final Fantasy and Castlevania titles with the superb tunes. They are catchy and pleasant. Each tune is used well in the game to lend a feel to a particular scene. Even the music for the first area (the Hindenburg) was amazing!

The developers put a lot of heart into this title and it shows. If you love action RPG, then this is a must play. It ranks up there with the Zelda titles for DS (but unlike the Zelda titles you can actually control Solatorobo without the stylus).

As for those cons I mentioned... battle is pretty easy and it involves the same core technique throughout the game, but it is still fun and never really gets too stale. The game is pretty easy, but it doesn't seem to detract from the overall feel. It's playable, enjoyable, and well made. And the GP mode is a fun little time passer too.

Arguably one of the best DS games ever made."
4139,5,"Epic game, came complete in box, still sealed"
4140,5,I really like this Game. this game is very interesting and different from other games. Graphics are awesome. Controls are easy to master. Overall gaming experience is great. Main Story line is great and easily can stretch for 20-30 hours. with side missions and other things you can get 100+ hours from this game. Story keeps you engage in this game. not boring in this game every event is different and unique which keep you going without getting bored. This Game include additional DLCs which are great too.
4141,5,"Wow.

This is Space Invaders? It is, but then again it's not. It's new, hip, challenging, trippy, amazing, but yet it still is very much Space Invaders.

Square-Enix truly has made something old feel amazingly new again. It's respectful of the classic 1978 game, but this is NOT just a rehash or classic rereleased. This high level of quality for a ""classic remixed"" game is a true rarity, you might find it only a few other places (Pac Man Championship Edition, and New Super Mario Brothers would be 2 good examples).

This is the new definitive version of the game. Forget all the endless rereleases that have come out through the years, this is ""the one"".

It's still 2d, with movements limited to left-right-shoot. But, there are new stategies. There are new enemies. There are enemies that hide behind other enemies, sometimes many of them. There are no bases like in the traditional Old School Space Invaders.

There's an incredible variety in the types of invaders, and they have various attack patterns and formations. The invader attacks are much harder to avoid, especially without the bases to hide behind.

Some invaders shoot the traditional bombs, others shoot large lasers, others have shields that block against certain types of your attacks, others wear armor so you have to shoot them several times.

There are bonus rounds which vary as well. You might have to shoot UFO's before a timer runs out, or shoot a certain amount of invaders before the timer runs out. If you can beat the bonus round you earn Fever Time, where you can power up for a short time.

Shooting a group of the same colored Invaders can yield bonus points and various power ups, like lasers, bullet spreads, and bombs.

There are Boss Fights. Yes, Boss Fights. In Space Invaders.

There is multiplayer. Local (from one cart), or flawless online. There is a Worldwide Rankings board. (The PSP one only has local multiplayer, the DS one is MUCH better).

The music is based electronic, and based on your gameplay. As you shoot, you make the music. And you will love the music you make. It affect the background as well. Trippy, groovy, and perfect for the game.

There is only one downside to Space Invaders Extreme. No paddle controller for America. In Japan, Taito made a weighted knob peripheral for the DS that plugs into the GBA slot at the bottom. It lets you play with a quick twist of the knob, and gives you a big advantage. SE/Tatio did not make this Paddle Controller available in the states but the game will support the paddle if you able to get one from Amazon Japan or PlayAsia. It also works for new new Arkanoid DS game. A definite purchase if you can.

For 20 bucks you won't find a better shooter than this. Buy this game. Now. If you like Space Invaders 1978, you should see what happens when a classic grows up."
4142,5,"My son bed for this game for the Xbox. He loves it. He is kind of young for the game, but he is learning. Would be great for kids older than seven."
4143,5,"NHL HITZ is a great game.  When Ps2 came out the best sports games came out on launch. This is the same way.  NHL HITZ is the best launch game.  Along with halo it has great graphics, showing you just how powerfull it really is.  I am not a big fan of Hockey, I don't obsess about watching it, but the games have always been the best. Look at n64's wayne gretzky, n64's 98 face off. Really good!  Customize your own teams without even owning a memory card, you don't need one with the large internal memory. Make your own plans, when you get a hat trick your player catches on fire and becomes omnipotent.  Hint: while replaying look closely at the crowd, they will display a code to put in during loading sequences... I have not seen what they all do yet, but they are helpful.. This game has replay value through the roof. Have fun spending hours at a time sucked into the black void in your tv with this really great game."
4144,5,"This is my favorite game of all time. It consumes a massive amount of time, and keeps you interested the entire time.

I play it all the time with my wife, we both enjoy it.

And remember, when playing, press ""ENTER"" and type in ""ISIS HEAR MY PLEA"" ;)"
4145,5,I'm very amazed by this cable. The difference is like night and day. Wow the 480p quality is very nice. Brings new life to my dreamcast system. The connection port is a kinda tight fit. But other then that it's a good purchase. I recommend it to anyone who wants upgrade to high resolution.
4146,5,Not sure if this game came out in 2013 but that is when I got it and it is one of the best of that year.
4147,5,"A fun game worth the money, if you like the original show, this game is enjoyable. The puzzle at the end of each level is pretty easy to figure out but its fun to be involed in the solving of the mystery. The last level is really a mystery as who done it, that was left for prehaps another game? This game was not too scary as my 4 year old grandson just loves it as well."
4148,5,Amazing game!
4149,5,For the price i though it wasn't real. This helps your DS charge for your gaming needs. But when i purchased it came brand new and works perfectly. Good for people who loses things all the time and need a new one fast.
4150,5,My second purchase of this.  Better than having to run out for batteries.
4151,5,"Love this game, and the product game in good shape"
4152,5,"It worked right out of the box (okay, you have to give Bill everything but your soul to register) and the connection was great. The headset/mic is fine. For the price, it includes access to all games for a full year, though don't think all Xbox games are available for Live. In particular, the Live football game is poor and Halo isn't yet supported, though Halo 2 will be, and that'll be out in the spring. Anyway, if you have broadband (only), it's worth it."
4153,5,Can't go wrong if u like gta
4154,5,Exactly as described. Showed up a day early.
4155,5,No one makes a carrying case like rds. Hear that insignia?
4156,5,"This charger works for 3DS, 3DS XL, and DSi.  I can't complain.  This charger works perfectly and is licensed by Nintendo."
4157,5,"If the original Final Fantasy (NES) first got me interested in RPGs, it was Final Fantasy II that got me hooked.  FFII was really the 4th game in the series, but was only the second to make it to the United States.  As opposed to the first game, this one had a story and well defined characters and the whole thing just sucked me in.
This game had one of the most interesting stories I had seen in a game up until that time.  You control Cecil, a Dark Knight serving under the King of Baron.  After taking Crystals from the magician village of Mysidia, Cecil questions why he is doing this, taking the Crystals from innocents.  He is sent to deliver a package to the Village of Mist.  Opening the package, the village is destroyed.  Cecil now works in opposition to Baron to try to save the Crystals and not allow Baron to get them all.  During this quest, the stakes get larger as Cecil learns of what is really going on.  Some of my favorite characters in the series are in this game: Golbez, Kain, Rydia, Rosa, FuSoYa, Edge, Yang, the Twins.  The cast of playable characters is large as characters come in and out of your party.  Some Final Fantasy staples are included in this game (Summoned Monsters, a guy named Cid, Airships, Chocobos).
The game is simply fun to play, and remains one of my favorites of the series,"
4158,5,"How can anyone NOT give this game 5 stars?  Knights of the Old Republic is a near perfect role-playing experience!
This is how role-playing games should be done; open-ended gameplay, deep customization options, superb cinematics, and extreme length!  I've spent 40 hours taking my time through the game and I'm not even halfway finished!  But I simply can't wait until then to review it.
Other than Rogue Leader and the upcoming Rebel Strike for the Gamecube, Knights is the best Star Wars game ever made.  The attention to detail is astounding.  Star Wars fans will find every character, sound effect, and image faithful to the movies and literature.  The camera is never a problem since you have full control over it.  Animation is the weakest part of Knights.  The frames per second stay pretty much constant all the time so there's no transition to notice.  But you can tell the animation is subpar compared to most new games.  It never bothered me.
I found Knights to be very non-linear.  Players are given a great deal of freedom to do as they wish in plot, action and interaction with the game's characters.  Once you get your spaceship you can select which planet you want to explore, and you can leave almost anytime you want in order to visit a different one.  Dialog in the game is handled by giving the player choices of what to say.  Some of the responses are truly hilarious.  But take what you say seriously, it can have a major effect on your main character's progress.  All of your characters can be customized greatly, from their statistics to their clothing.  When you slap a piece of armor on someone it shows them wearing it on the screen at all times.  There are endless numbers of tools and weapons at your disposal to further outfit your team, although certain people can't use certain items (Wookies can't wear armor).  Lightsabers and Force powers make themselves available eventually and boy, are they ever satisfying!  If you plan on using light side Force powers a lot be kind and helpful in your adventures.  If you want to use dark side powers easily just be mean to everyone you encounter.  The scope of choices in gameplay is impressive.
To keep things fresh there are a few minigames strewn throughout your adventure.  I liked the Pazaak card game.  It was easy to understand and proved to be a fun way to build credits even if it's mostly a matter of luck to win.
The music is what you would expect from a Star Wars experience.  You'll hear some familiar tunes but most is brand new stuff that fits on-screen events well.  Definitely no complaints there.
No other game I know of does such an entertaining job of ingrossing you in what it's like to be a Jedi than this one.  Of course if you just want to be a Han Solo, blaster-toting scoundrel that's your choice, too.  That's what makes this game so fun: FREEDOM.  As far as I'm concerned this is an essential purchase for X-Box owners."
4159,5,awesome
4160,5,"Works fine, priced well"
4161,5,"Gran Turismo 4 is going to be a REALLY TOTAL AWESOME game to play

I give it a 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY & PLAY this game on the Sony Playstation 2 game system

This is a MUST HAVE GAME TO BUY & PLAY IT"
4162,5,Grip feels sooo good and natural. My hands are comfortable now and they aren't cramped and fall asleep!
4163,5,"Virtua Fighter 4 is an amazing game, one that has made me into a fan.  I am not much of a fighting game fan, but this game is great!
The graphics are amazing!  Sega has really done a good job of pushing the PS2 to the edge of the envelope.  The settings are quite detailed, and even the weather comes into play.  The facial expressions, the clothing, I just can't believe this game is this good.
The AI is quite highly developed, and I particularly like the training mode on this game (being that I'm not a fan of the genre).
The replay value in this game is high as well.  Unlike many games out there now (final fantasy, Metal Gear, Devil May Cry, et al) this is one game you can play again and again and again.  Invite your friends over and have a blast, or play single player, it doesn't matter.
All in all this game is a must own.  What more do you need to know?  Hit that add to cart button!!!!"
4164,5,Purchased for my 10 year and she absolutely loves it. I've joined her in a few routines and good way to get a fun workout. I definitely recommend for parents who want to gives kids fun exercise!!
4165,5,Bought this game as a gift for Christmas.  The game came promptly and was as indicated in the description .
4166,5,Didnt think i would like it but i had fun playing it. Cant wait to get state of decay 2!
4167,5,will enjoy for his birthday thanks
4168,5,"I absolutely love this headset! I've owned it since day one with minimal issues. The only issue I've had is with drivers... Oh well. Its very stylish and has amazing sound! Though honestly, with how little I actually use the lighting effects, I should have gone with the cheaper non-chroma version."
4169,5,"My new favorite game - every part of it is awesome and there is so much replay value....  Great campaign levels and story, great online play, level editor and custom maps....  Just great!"
4170,5,"If you've ever been wondering what the funnest, fastest and coolest racing game ever was, this is it. Burnout 3 is, without a shadow of doubt, a great game. In fact, ""great"" ain't enough to describe it. It's more like an ""absolutly amazingly incredible times ten"" kinda game. It's a game so near perfect, so fun, that it'll never get old, ever. I'm not exaggerating here, what I'm saying is the truth, and the truth is that Burnout 3 is great. Oops, there I go again with the ""great"" thing..."
4171,5,"Great game to enjoy while deployed, made time go buy quick!"
4172,5,My brotherinlaw is hooked on these games.. he loves them!
4173,5,"Works perfectly, plug in and no need to configure using the cd for some. Will test with my wii mote and nunchuk later but will work good, hopefully."
4174,5,"You're gonna need this for your XBOX ONE X if you plan on keeping your Kinect.  Works as intended, wished it didn't require external power though."
4175,5,"Excelente producto, 100% recomendado"
4176,5,"dont know alot about this game, my daughter seems to like it, she like mystery and the titanic so i thought it would be cool, shipping was fast and product was in great shape."
4177,5,CHINA
4178,5,Definitely a unique and creative choice by Nintendo & the Mario Kart series. This game still holds as one of my favorite Mario Kart games. I would highly recommend to anyone who loves any other games in the Mario Kart series. It's worth a try!
4179,5,This is cool. New in box from 1999.
4180,5,This is easily worth the money! Has over 6500 questions and more you can purchase in PS store!  I would pay $50 for this! Me and my wife love it!!
4181,5,load
4182,5,"Cowboys, Guns  and Zombies OH MY!! Great Fun, you can spend hours and hours, if not weeks and weeks with this game and its a total BLAST! Never got bored!!"
4183,5,This is an awesome product that makes using the controller of the PS4 more comfortable so you can play longer and more accurately
4184,5,"The wii u expands on the greatness of the wii.

The 8 gig version is not a good idea because of the limited space get the 24 gig

As the wii was the best of the last generation with the best games the wii U will rule this one."
4185,5,Very good!
4186,5,"I'm hooked.  This game is just way too much fun.  Basically, you're in a grand theft auto style city where you can pretty much climb any surface.  There aren't really any interior spaces but everything else is fair game.  And that's just the beginning of this.  Climbing, jumping and falling is all without consequence.  You can take a fall from the tallest building and roll with it.

Then you've got your karma gauge which adjusts depending on how you use your powers for good and evil.  I've got people taking pictures of me now as I've been trying to be good and heal people.  Your powers will continue to grow and there are many things to find.

There is a radar which you'll have to use to find hidden items which you'll be using a lot.  To get more power storage and find more items, you're dependent on the radar.  And if you're color blind like me, that can sometimes be a challenge to figure out the colors exactly.

The graphics are great.  The game is pretty forgiving for beginner players and throws just enough at you that you can't wait to see what's next.  The new powers that you unlock depend on your level of good or bad as well.  There are hours of play here.  Definitely a winner!"
4187,5,"Works perfect, but still expensive, hope sony thinks about not overprice their products."
4188,5,"Wow this game really threw me for a loop! I had my gameface on, my fingers were limber and ready for mashing...I was totally set to send everyone in Tokyo to the hospital...

30 minutes into the game and I've taken Haruka for some ice cream (double scoop), got her a KittyKat (calico) from the arcade and we went for a walk through downtown tokyo...hand in hand. Oh ya, along the way I kicked in two guys' teeth, elbow smashed another into a wall and dropped the heel of my boot onto the bridge of some guy's nose...and I only just left the epilogue. It gets crazier...way crazier (acting as a double in a B-movie, fighting through old ladies to get a movie-stars autograph, avoid letting your 6 scoop ice cream cones from toppling over...) I cant even remember all of them. I cant even go over all the quests because
1- there's many
2- They are so off the wall, most of them don't even fall into normal categories
Pros:
Lots of combat, all over the place.
Lots and lots of events / sidegames to keep you busy
constantly changing locations/times of day
seamless combat - load times integrated into the game
'perfect shot' - forget what they call it in-game, the ability to learn new moves from observing your surroundings.

Cons:
Lots of combat, all of the place. (Can be distracting when you're hot on a quest or trying to learn the area)
I love anime, I watch it with eng subtitles so I had no problems with the game.
For those who aren't into reading...go make a sandwich, cause the event cutscenes cant be FFwd and they're in Jp, but they look really good.

I don't know if Y1 and Y2 were better and I don't care!  This game was a total blast. I wimped out and played on easy my first run - next run will be hard (to unlock Ex).
Also, there is a card to unlock more content from the Jp version, as well as DLC at the PSN. I'll have my hands full with this game for a while and totally recommend this, and not to just fight-genre fans"
4189,5,I have always wanted to get into this series. This set is a great way to start with all the expansions!
4190,5,"Forza Horizon returns! This time the Festival visits Australia which was a good choice for scenic purposes. Now, I am not a car guy, I literally know nothing about cars. But I bought Horizon 2 on Black Friday two years ago and I loved it. So I had high expectations for Horizon 3. It delivers on those expectations. The game immediately tosses you in as the Festival leader for the first time, walking you through new features like hiring drivatars to work for the Festival, hiring radio stations, or building a fan base through both races and stunt events. Showcase events are back and the game pretty much kicks off with the showcase that is shown in many of the trailers, where you race a huge double-rotor helicopter.

I bought the Early Access because I am out of town next week and I really wanted to play ASAP, and I'm glad I did. It's been fun. Horizon 3 is an easy game to pick up, but you can make it as challenging as you would like. There's a lot of flexibility and customization, but at the same time it's not overwhelming. Many features and vehicles from previous Forza games return. The graphics look great, especially the Australian environment and sky. There are a ton of songs to listen to as you play, from EDM to classical, or just drive in silence. I highly recommend buying this game if you are a car person or a driving simulator enthusiast. The game has a 91 on Metacritic, so they must have done something right with this game. I have loved it and look forward to playing it in the weeks ahead."
4191,5,"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a great game for the Zelda fan.  This game follows the events that occurred after the Ocarina of Time.  Link is on the search for his fairy companion, Navi, who disappeared through a window in the Temple of Time after Link defeated Ganondorf.  After a confrontation with the Skull Kid, Link is sent to Termina and has three days to stop the Skull Kid from having the moon completely destroy Termina and Clock Town.  This game is really interesting because Link gets to re-live those three days over and over again, Groundhog Day style.  While this was initially a bit frustrating for me because you lose all the items you're carrying/rupees/dungeon keys/progress/etc each time you play the Song of Time,  it started growing me as I learned each town person's schedule, started enjoying the feeling of being rushed to complete a task, and started seeing the story unravel from different characters at different locations throughout those three days.

Of the Zelda series I've played so far, this has the most dark story line - but it's also one of the most compelling.  The story line revolved a lot around death and redemption, and while it initially seemed a bit macabre, I really enjoyed seeing the stories unfold, and had a greater appreciation for each character.  This is definitely a game where the NPCs shine.  The game control is pretty much identical to the Ocarina of Time 3DS with much of the game control coming from the D pad as well as some touch pad elements.

Unlike the Ocarina of Time, the boss battles were very easy in Majora's Mask.  Part of this stems from the fact that you will likely have to battle these bosses again in order to complete the many side quests, but part of it also stems from the fact that you're under tight time constraints.  For those of you who are familiar with the long drawn out Water Temple dungeons, you will likely have to play that Song of Time and lose everything, then replay everything again once you figure out where items are and how the puzzles operate.  Like I said, this time constraint can be frustrating at times, but for me, it grew on me as I started enjoying the added pressure.

Overall, this is a really great game with an amazing story - I would definitely finish Ocarina of Time before playing this game, just to get all the little references made about OoT in this game.  The visuals are stunning, the game play is fun, and the characters are memorable.  This is a definitely a game you'll want to complete all the side quests in.  Seeing some of the NPC stories - particularly Anju and Kafei's story - are beautiful.  This is definitely a game worth considering."
4192,5,great game and fast ship!!
4193,5,I can't tell the difference between the 200 keyboards from this cheap baby. Looks great in white too!
4194,5,"Man.. this game i don't know even where to begin all i can say is it's the best game on ps3 for me. Ive put in so many hrs already still gotta finish but omg. It just sucks how this game is so good that its ruined other games YOU WILL NOT enjoy other games like seriously. well it's hard to i mean but for the people who say its too hard and quit.. listen i always play games on easy and nothing pisses me off more than dying but ds2 dying is your education. i won't go into detail about ds2 style since alot of people have covered that but i will list off reasons why this game is better then dark souls one. and dark souls one is my 2nd fav ps3 game.

+ summons are WAY easier i recommend buying a ring from the majula cat and when you equip it the ring makes you choose a god and if your friend chooses same god then summoning will be more easier.
+ summons actually instanly show as failed if someone else got your friend so you don't wait
+ graphics (imo) are way better and you can tell dev's had more time to polish game better
+ the overall balance of the game is better item wise etc
+ you cant just rush attack and run anymore. game forces you to be slow but smart and cautious
+ insta fast travel bonfire kinda like warp in ds1 (best feature imo)
+ smoother animations and better sound/ more realistic sound
+ jumping is easier (minor i know but whatever)
+ better bosses and more harder
+ more rings weapons armors pyro sorcery and you name it. bigger variety in EVRYTHING on this game.
+ for a ps3 game it looks just as good as ps4. (some might disagree) but game is just beautiful graphically.

i could probably list so many things but theres too many to name you just have to play the game. The games music is epic as well and this game is just 100 hours of gameplayu waiting if you get it. other games get boring after a 5-10 hr story but this game will take over your social life. and won't get boring."
4195,5,Works as advertised.
4196,5,Game is great and a fun one to play. No doubt would buy again if I somehow lost it. Great quality. Must buy!
4197,5,Great
4198,5,One of the best games for driving. Fun to play online.
4199,5,"What's great about it: It fixes a lot about the original game (Diablo 3)
What's not so great: It might be difficult for brand new players

Diablo 3's expansion, Reaper of Souls, does quite a lot to fix the issues that plagued the original Diablo 3. The Real Money Auction House is now gone, the new loot 2.0 system actually lets players get stronger with the loot they acquire (it's a smart loot system that more often drops loot tuned for your currently played class), there's a new craft (mystic) that lets players pay to reroll certain stats on loot, and that's just the beginning. The soundtrack is fantastic and really captures the overall Diablo tone and the new areas are quite expansive and not simple re-skins of current areas. Also, the level cap has been raised and new abilities and skills have been added along with an entirely new class (Crusader) so there's plenty to do. It's fresh, it's fun, it's fixed, it's addicting... it's Diablo. NO ONE CAN STOP DEATH!"
4200,5,worked as aspect ed and shipped fast.
4201,5,"awesome adventures, nice graphics. great game for kids of every age. still enjoy sonic the hedgehog. recommended for the sonic fan"
4202,5,love it
4203,5,"I have played this game online and its a little difficult to get into initially, but once you get the hang of things, its a lot of fun.

I also like the single player a lot. Not sure how this compares to Battlefield, but by itself, its a great game."
4204,5,"Bought it today and I can only say WOW!

If there's been a game that has been Nintendo's killer franchise, it's Mario Kart.

The track designs are gorgeous and innovative. The racing has been rebalanced to be less frustrating and yet wildly competitive.

Alternating this game with Watch Dogs for my PS4 it's the best I can do right now :-)

Highly recommended."
4205,5,"I got this game as a free ""Games with Gold"" in April of this year. I had no idea of what was to come when playing this and HOLY WHOA!!! This game is truly among the most disturbing and terrifying games I've ever played on the xbox 360 and surpassing what I felt when I first played the original Quake, Doom, and even Mortal Kombat games back in the 1990s. This game, known as ""Dead Space"" to me is a brilliant cross between Resident Evil, The Thing (1982), and the 1997 movie ""Event Horizon"".

 This game is of a story of a planet-cracking mining ship called the USS Ishimura that had a crew of over 1000 but then contact with it was lost after it encountered an alien artifact called The Marker. A team comprised of protaganist Isaac and several others are sent to investigate and search the ship for survivors as they are unable to establish contact with the ship. What they discover is horror beyond imagination.

 This game truly is among the best games ever made but man oh man, it truly is one of the few games that I can say truly scared the daylights out of me. Enemies will spring out with no warning, in darkness, in poor light, and through any opening imaginable. They are truly frightening, ruthless, and horrifying on every level.

 Play this game on a dark, rainy or stormy night, or late at night, with the lights turned off, and the volume up loud. Whatever you do, prepare yourself for real frights and galore. I've never felt so disturbed or scared by a video game, not even by Resident Evil, Quake or Doom. And because of it, ""Dead Space"" and it's sequel are among the best games ever for the PS3 or Xbox 360! Highly recommended, if you are brave and steel-stomached enough."
4206,5,VERY NICE  =  )
4207,5,"very fun GoW game, the only downside is that its a bit on the short side, about 4-5 hours give or take."
4208,5,This is a great product very well made. The seller shipped it out quickly. I would recommend this seller and I will buy again from them
4209,5,I'm a huge NBA fan & I love the 2k games. I have 2k10 for the Wii & this game is a nice improvement with much better graphics & features. I just bought a Wii U & decided to upgrade to a more up to date NBA game. All Wii U owners that are NBA fans should buy this game now. It's well worth it.
4210,5,Phenomenal.
4211,5,"This game really exceeded my expectations.

This is the style of game that Far Cry was always meant to be.

I have 2 strong recommendations to greatly enhance your experience.

1.  Turn off the HUD as much as possible.  It really increases your immersion and the graphics are so great you don't need all that junk getting in the way of them.

2.  Bump up the difficulty to hard at the minimum.  Expert might be too much for many people and with so many predator encounters and their aggressiveness.  Hard can and should be used.  It makes you slow down a bit and think and plan your encounters.  You can't just wade in and alert every enemy.  You have to rely on stealth and planning more and the use of traps and the environment.

The graphics and the amount of detail in this world are awesome.  The setting for this style of play and game mechanics couldn't be more perfect.  I guess when the next Far Cry comes out if its back to an island and driving around shooting bad guys, I will do it, but I am gonna be wondering the whole time what this will look like in Primal II.

While crafting is part of it, your not going to waste hours of time looking for some rare ingredient.  Most every ingredient is available with just a tiny bit of effort and a tool tip is available to assist you in where to locate them.  The crafting aspect doesn't get in the way of playing the game and having fun.  I know some of you hate crafting and thats because of games where you have to find a magic moonberry that only drops from a purple whatchyamacallit at midnight on a full moon and oh by the way, you need 99 of them.  This game isn't like that at all.  Just picking stuff up on the way to complete missions is going to be enough to keep your crafting even with the game progress.  If you spend a few hours grinding it you can have nearly everything in the game crafted and upgraded except the ones that require you to progress in the story.

There are plenty of side quests/missions to keep you busy while you are completing the main story arc.  The great beast hunts are tremendous fun.  My only quarrel with those hunts is the fact the the beasts don't heal if you fail so if you die and on your next retry their health will be exactly where you left it.  That should be patched so that they return to full health.

I hope UbiSoft comes out with some good DLC for this game.  No need to jack it up with uber weapons.  Just add areas and story.  Although a good alternate idea would be a Dinosaur download, I guess uber weapons would be needed then.

I strongly recommend picking this game up.  I don't see how you could go wrong."
4212,5,"I'm only eight hours in so far, but this game is shaping up to be fantastic. It reminds me of my favorite parts of Persona 4, and my favorite parts of Suikoden II, plus a little something else to make it all its own beast. The difficulty on normal is a good balance for those looking to enjoy some casual battle without it taking away from the story. Speaking of which, the story so far is looking good, with some trademark jrpg humor and awkwardness to pepper in between the serious moments. It seems like it will be a slow burn, with a nice long build up along the way. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a brilliant turn-based experience that has been made to feel exciting and current.

Update! I'm on my second playthough. That's right, the game so nice I'm playing it twice. In order to really get everything you need to play it at least twice. I'm sure if you went nuts and followed a guide you could do it all in one go, but what fun is that? My review stands just as strong now as the day I first posted it. Get this game, and do it before the second one comes out so nothing gets spoiled for you!"
4213,5,I use this for work and I like it a lot. I never turn the PC off and the lights have not failed to work yet.
4214,5,It is not an authenic controller but this clone does exsactly the same as the original wii one we have a lot of fun with it
4215,5,"also this game tends to have a sound error every few hours! lol
tis a good game my leige"
4216,5,FUN FUN FUN GAME!!
4217,5,"Wonderful addition to the Mario universe.

Keep up the good work Mr. Miyamoto!"
4218,5,"The Xbox 360 controller is just wonderful, the best console controller I've ever held in fact.

Those looking to buy the ""Xbox 360 controller for windows"" should be aware that this is the EXACT same controller, so buy whichever is cheaper. The only difference is that the former comes with the software CD...whereas you'll have to download the software for this one from the website. Also, the windows packaging is far uglier...if you care. But both are USB and work with either 360 or PC.

Microsoft making this controller cross compatible is actually a pretty big deal as there may finally be a level of standardization for PC controllers, if most people being using this controller is makes it far easier on game developers to know what interface gamers are using. In fact, many games are coming with a 360 control scheme pre-installed, just as Need For Speed Most Wanted."
4219,5,"I was never thinging about get this one until I read reviewers all say it is really precise and responsive.
It IS indeed! It adds more fun to control the car than normal controllers."
4220,5,Works like a charm. Fans of beat'em ups will be pleased.
4221,5,My daughter loves it.
4222,5,"I got this for my birthday and I've loved it every minute. It has several modes for single or multiplayer. There's story mode, tournament mode, and an all-out free-for-all. I would recommend this game to everyone. If you don't have it, IT'S A MUST!

4227,5,"I bought this mainly for Euro and American Truck Simulators. It works great for both and has great wheel controls in the options. I noticed the description of this wheel keeps mentioning ""force feedback"" but I don't believe it said anything about the wheel being mechanically driven.. meaning theres an actual motor behind the wheel that has 100% control. Through that motor, you can control wheel stiffness, centering, etc. There is no spring that launches the wheel back to the original position. I was pretty surprised by this when I plugged it in for the first time and the wheel spun all the way in one direction, then all the way in the other direction, then back to center. I assume is was an auto-calibration. But it did all that without me doing anything other than plugging it in. It's pretty advanced stuff and knocks the socks off of the original ""Farming Wheel"" that this is replacing. As far as the brake petal, I can see how the stiffness could get annoying in a racing game where you need a fast response, but its great for simulator games. The stiffness prevents you from slamming the brakes when you're coming up to a stop. It makes for a nice and smooth stop that you have a lot of control over."
4228,5,Purchase for my son.  He loves it.
4229,5,"The idea of marrying a JRPG with a fighting game might have seemed weird, but Persona 4 Arena pulls it off brilliantly. Arc System Works has done a great job of making a game that doesn't just look like Persona, but feels like it too.

In the Persona games, each character has a Persona with special skills they use in battle. So it is here - each character has strong and weak attacks, and their Persona has strong and weak attacks. The Persona has a mini health bar of its own, and five hits sends it away to recover. There are even status effects like poison and dizzy, similar to what you'd see in a RPG.

Like ASW's other games, this game is fast-paced, technical, and with lots of different systems around. In addition to Persona break, there is a meter (indicated with SP, like the Persona games) and a burst. However, the game doesn't get bogged down by the details. It's pretty accessible, and even has a simple auto-combo system for the button mashing beginners.

Persona 4 Arena is a full-featured game with a detailed story mode with lots of cinemas and voice acting, an arcade mode, a score attack mode (with full online leaderboards), a lesson mode with tutorials, a challenge mode, and a training mode. Unlike a Capcom fighter, there's lots to do here.

The online mode deserves a special mention. First of all, the game does an excellent job of pairing up fighters with good connections. This is key, and it's also why so many games seem to have bad ""netcode."" By pairing up people who have a good connection to one another, Persona 4 Arena ensures the hard work is already done. Once in the game, it plays great - as close to a local game as one can get. Combos hit, action is intense, and it just works great. In terms of feature set, online has the usual 8-player lobbies, detailed player cards, and leveling for each character. There are no issues here.

The Persona games have, for my money, some of of the best character designs out there in games. So it makes sense to put them in a genre with such an emphasis on individual characters. The sprites are huge and well-animated, with lots of flair and color. Each character looks great. The Personas look amazing - like their illustrations in the RPG menus. The backgrounds, inspired by Persona 4, are colorful and stylish. This game looks spectacular.

The voice acting is very good and features both English and Japanese VA. There is commentary throughout the match, similar to the voice acting in the Persona battles. The music is classic Persona - a mix of brooding tunes and upbeat Japanese pop. I'm not one of those people who listens to J-pop normally, but I love the Persona music.

I can see myself playing Persona 4 Arena for years. It's insanely good. I couldn't get into Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Street Fighter X Tekken for a number of reasons, but Persona 4 Arena works."

4238,5,"I'm writing this review pretty late since it's already 2013, but I'll cut to the chase. I've been a die-hard Doom fan since the original MS-DOS Doom was released in 1993. I love the metal casing and my package came right on time. For anyone unsure on what Doom 3: Collector's Edition contains here's a list:

Doom 3
Ultimate Doom
Doom 2
G4 Videos (4 Parts)
Concept Art
Behind the scenes with the creators

Although you could just buy Doom 3 BFG Edition nowadays, I still prefer the XBOX version over it, not to mention its compatible with the XBOX 360. Also the game has Splitscreen co-op and Deathmatch support. Merry DoomsDay :)"
4239,5,Fun Game!!
4240,5,"Quick delivery, bought at a cheap price so I won't have to compete with America's nonsense about amiibos. Great craftsmanship and quality"

4242,5,Suspenseful like the movies !!!
4243,5,"How do you take a perfect game and make it better?  Such a question must have been on the minds of the Assassin's Creed designers.  Assassin's Creed I was an award-winning game, and also one of my favorite games of all-time.  Its beautiful replicas of Middle Eastern cities, fun gameplay, and intriguing storyline drew me in.  Months after I finished it, I would think about it - and even bought Prince of Persia to have a similar gameplay experience (also fun times).  When I was in Cairo, I actually started thinking about how Altair would scale some of their minarets!

Assassin's Creed II does the impossible - improve on perfection.  The game wasn't changed as much as it was enhanced.  The gameplay is very similar to the first game, where you play an assassin and much of the gameplay involves climbing, jumping and scaling buildings, much like Parkour.  The fight scenes are just as spectacular.  I loved that the first game never allowed you to die - just ""desynchronize"". For some reason, this aspect gave me the bravery I needed to try things out that in other games, I wouldn't - knowing I would ""die"".  The game has the same mini-games, such as races, and collection games, in this case treasures instead of flags.  As in the first game, you are limited to a small section of cities at first, and then it is expanded - but these cities appear to be much larger than the last game.

So what is new?  Well, the setting for one - renaissance Italy.  I have been to Florence and Venice, and this game makes a very good re-creation of those places.  It was thrilling to ascend Il Duomo when I have been inside it in real life.  The story is a bit more personal and compelling than the last - you're not just an assassin - you are a wronged member of the Italian gentry, driven by vengeance.

Also, the game added some other key changes - the ability to change armor, weapons, and your appearance.  You can buy these things rather than waiting for new weapons to be given to you during gameplay. You get money from treasures and from looting bodies. You also get to have a villa that you can improve, a homebase.

What I like best, aside from jumping across rooftops and scaling towers, is just how beautiful and realistic the setting is, from the stunning graphics - particularly the vistas from ""viewpoints"" - to the language spoken.  After a session of playing this game, I start planning my next trip to Italy!"
4244,5,"Gift for nephew, he loved it!"
4245,5,"This is my 3rd Mystery PI game and I've enjoyed all.  Good graphics, fun searching.  Most Pop Cap games are worth buying."
4246,5,generally this game i use for online purposes and boy is it good for that. i had never liked a fps before. i was bought this so i played it and i loved it. i have only done 2/3 missions because i find online so much more fun. the game really should have voice chat features though but none the less an incredible game.
4247,5,"My original d-pad popped off and it just completely broke, so, I had to get a new one. This d-pad feels significantly sturdier than the previous one, though I would not recommend it to people who don't have a lot of time on their hands. The screws on the back of the Xbox 360 controller are very tight. It takes a while to get them all out and you do have to get ALL of them out, or you won't be able to properly replace your d-pad. Luckily this comes with a screwdriver of the right type, which would be rather hard to find elsewhere. Bottom line, if you want to keep using your old controller and the only thing wrong is your d-pad, this will do the trick."
4248,5,Really good condition

- Graphics look fantastic
- open world pirate-themed game (which is awesome)
- gamepad features (off-tv play, gamepad interactive map when playing on TV)
- good (not great) story-line
- addicting gameplay
- Edward Kenway is a great Assassin/character

cons:
- story-line drags a bit at times
- at sea battles are still frustrating at times (it all depends on personal progression within the story)"
4251,5,Me and my 10 year old daughter love this game its fun taking care of the people and getting them to fall in love with eachother and have babies lol. The characters are funny and its just a good game to play to escape reality for little while.
4252,5,"Personally, these are perfect. They work great, and I have no problems with signal strength or accuracy. I love that it keeps that darned cord out of my way!

If this one were to break, I would definitely buy another... but so far it's lasted a good while, works great, looks great, and I love it!

Oh, but note that for some people if you try to start it up mid-game, it might not work. That's what happened to me when I tried to use it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-It-Out/dp/B002CZ7P04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk It Out</a>.

4255,5,the best
4256,5,this game card met my expectations. It works great . I have had no problems with it. If you need one try this.
4257,5,"This game is just wonderful.
Havent had a single problem.  Not one crash or error.
Those whom are, simply must not meet the requirements with their computer to play this game.  Unlike TS2 it requires much more to run the game.

The graphics are simply beautiful.  A major improvement from the previous sims.  So much more control over what you do, what you want you're sim to like and dislike.  No more load times to visit another lot and many things to do outside the home.
The possibilities are quite endless.

The newest thing is the progression of TS3.  Now you're neighbors and friends will also age as you do, they will get married, have kids, grow old and die.  I think that adds quite a bit to the realism of the game.

Many things are different so it cant really be compared to TS2.  It takes some getting used too but its definitely a great addition and I just cant wait to see more expansions to TS3."
4258,5,no words to describe how much I love this game
4259,5,"This has to be one of the funnest Shooter Game/Strategy that I have ever played. ALL the games are fun, even the first Metal Gear (which looks like PS1 graphics). This is recommended for anyone who never played Metal Gear and would like to own it. Get this collection now, don't buy them individually, it's a better value for the buck. Especially the 3rd game, which cost as much as this entire package.

If your someone that is timid about shooters I'd recommend this as well. This game is so fun that you'll forget about the shooting(depending on which version) and instead wonder how to sneak around that enemy near that left wall, or perhaps lure that other enemy into a trap? This game is focused on stealth, and although you can fight enemies (which at points you have to) it's better to avoid detection.

The characters are also ""realistic"", even in the PS1 version. From Snake's ""quirky"" comments and attitude, you'll enjoy the variety of personalities within each character and how they react to each-other as well. If Snake dies in the game, the characters will scream his name in desperation. Which can be a little sad.

My only con is the memory card. The game did not ""read"" the memory card on the PS2 (This is the original PS2 memory card) and therefore I could not save. I turned the system off, back on, same result. I then cleaned the slot and card. Same. So then I had to reset the machine and pull the memory card out, then put it back in without the CD. Funny thing is that the system read the card itself. So I'm not sure if it was the game's fault itself, but I was finally able to save after deleting some free space and having to go up against another ""no memory"" lapse even after deleting some space before I was finally able to save."
4260,5,goood
4261,5,"Every once in a while, a video game comes along and redefines a genre, defines the capabilities of a console, or both. Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is one of those games that accomplishes both feats. Ubisoft's next-gen centerpiece turned out to be quite a game in almost every way imaginable. From the intense duck-and-cover, squad-based gameplay to the beautiful environments and the amazing online multiplayer, GRAW has it all.

The single-player campaign's story puts you into the helmet of Captain Scott Mitchell, a member of the Ghost Recon team working for the United States government. It's 2013, and Mitchell and his crew are armed with equipment that could accurately and precisely take out a small army in moments. Their goal is to secure the United States and Mexican presidents from Mexican rebels who attack during a trade deal that would make peace with three separate countries. From there, it's up to the wits and military smarts of the gamer and his or her crew to stay alive, suppress the enemy, and protect the VIPs.

Each of the game's 11 long, engaging missions will test your wits as a Ghost. Mitchell and his crew are already armed with the proper equipment and it's the optimization of the surroundings that will keep your squad alive. Fortunately, thanks to an extremely intuitive squad command system and heads-up display (HUD), ordering your squad to move out is as simple as pressing up on the directional pad while pointing at a location. You can even change their approach from Recon to Assault for sneaking or aggressively going into a battle guns-blazing.

That isn't to say that Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is ever a run-and-gun game. Instead, its pace is as slow as a slug but as intense as any game you've ever played before. Imagine Call of Duty 2 on its Veteran setting; that's how intense this game can be. Even a situation, one as early as the third level, is extremely intense. I was almost too afraid to poke my head around a corner and take a pot shot at an attacking rebel and his back-up, an armored APC complete with a machine gunner. Unfortunately for my on-screen Ghost, my brash tactic of rolling out from cover and trying to take out the gunner resulted in the Game Over screen and a look of disappointment on my face while my Ghost lay dead on the ground.

The gameplay is extremely tight thanks to a set of perfect controls. While at first the scheme felt awkward, after a few minutes of getting used to it, I was ready to load terrorists with lead and direct my team with relative ease. Even when back-up arrives, usually in the form of Cypher spy cameras or Bradley tanks, controlling everything on the screen is easy. When the going gets really tough, the player can use the optimized HUD to mark enemy locations, find different routes, and locate mission objectives. The HUD even offers a mini-screen located at the top-left of your television screen that allows you to view the game through the eyes of a comrade or your support units. Overall, I'd say that GRAW is the first game I've ever played where the HUD was sometimes the most helpful part of the game. Because of this, and the general tight feeling of the gameplay, I feel that GRAW is one of the best action titles around.

My only complaint with the gameplay is the ""unsnapping"" from a wall; it is sometimes too difficult to do in dangerous situations. Rather than simply pulling away from the wall at any given moment, I found myself having to wait for Mitchell to complete whatever he was doing before he'd ""unsnap"" from the wall. Generally, I only panicked when a terrorist ran around the corner and faced me with his gun raised while I was reloading. This situation, 100% of the time, brought up that damn Game Over screen again and again.

I've honestly never played a game that felt so tactical and felt so realistic. Thanks in part to the visuals, which I'll mention in a moment, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter has the best level design I've seen from a shooter in years. The open feeling of the different urban areas is a fresh breath of life after linear games like The Outfit have been spinning in my Xbox 360. If I approached a firefight from one angle and found myself dying every time, I could usually pull back and approach the situation from another angle-and simply making use of my tools, like the HUD and tactical map, did I find the perfect route. Using my support units, like the Cyphers and Bradleys, I could spy on the enemy and pinpoint their location and then watch as they're obliterated. Then I could clean up any mess left over with my trusty MR-C rifle.

The visuals in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter are quite simply the best thing I've ever seen from a video game. I've never played a game that looked this advanced-from the environments to the HUD, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is truly the first next-generation video game. The city feels real. As I'm creeping along the alleyways of a run-down Mexican suburb, I can almost smell the mud and dirt that I sneak on. I can almost taste the gunpowder in the air after a firefight. I feel like I could reach into the television screen and take a shot with Mitchell's rifle, then high-five him after a bullet plows through a terrorist's skull from 200 yards away. Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter simply has to be seen to be believed, so I'll leave that experience for you to discover!

As good as Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter looks, it also sounds amazing. As you sneak along, picking off terrorists, you'll hear distant firefights and nearby yells from other terrorists. If you're unseen and without a Cypher spy camera, you can always rely on your ears to know when a cluster of terrorists is waiting around the corner.

Multiplayer, both on Xbox Live and local Xbox 360 matches, is absolutely fantastic. With Elimination (deathmatch), Last Man Standing, and Territories (same as Halo 2's mode), Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter has some of the most fundamental yet entertaining modes of play. The maps are also fantastic. ""Nowhere"", a ghost town with hills, rocks, a junkyard, and a deadly, wide-open main street, is my favorite. Each of the maps offer strategic locations and tactical possibilities for each of the game's character classes, like Riflemen, Marksmen, and Grenadiers. The weapon selection is also much larger than it is in the single-player mode, and the controls are optimized for faster gameplay. On Xbox Live, gamers are given a rank-based off of real-life military ranks-for their performance. Similarly to Halo 2's level system, better players have higher ranks. Earning a new rank in GRAW is much more gratifying, though, as it requires a lot more time and skill than it does in Halo 2. While the gameplay experiences are entirely different, with Halo 2 being more frantic and action-packed and less tactical, I predict Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter's online community will be huge, just like the legendary Xbox title.

Not everything in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is perfect. I was particularly annoyed with the on-rails helicopter sequences, the unsnapping from walls and the sometimes-spotty AI of my comrades. Still, the game is dangerously close to that label, and the three complaints I just mentioned are pretty easy to deal with in exchange for the best visuals and the next big Xbox Live title. Ubisoft should be proud; they've created one of the very few Xbox 360 must-have titles. Action fans will absolutely love this game, and next to Call of Duty 2 and Dead or Alive 4, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is a game that should be in your Xbox 360 inventory."

4263,5,"I'm 33, and at the moment have brought out my NES for my son(and for me)and now I'm grabbing all of my favorite games of my childhood, and among the many of them is ""BTTF"". The many negative reviews and other people saying ""this game sucks"",hated it for the simple fact of it's extreme difficulty. You have your basic simple premise to dodge bully's,hoola hoop girls, pits, and oil, ridiculous I know, but fun. The controls are basic and easy and are are smoothly done for it's time. At the end of a few blocks of skating,dodging and throwing bowling balls at your enemies, your first mission awaits, and it's the mini games that frustrate so many gamers, yes it's difficult and it can be done and therefore it has a good game-play value, not simply a game you beat and put in the dust-pile of old games. There's four mini-games(the cafe,the school of blocking hearts,the dance and the finale in the Delorion.) Maybe for me it's just the nostalgia factor but I'm playing this on break and still cant put it down. Your a true gamer if you beat this one."

GRAPHICS - amazing. Players look exactly as they do in real life - their height, weight, face, even equipment accessories such as gloves and arm bands
SOUND - satisfactory. John Madden & Al Michaels are much better than the old Madden & Summeral tandem. Plus the commentary is more timely now. For example, instead of the default ""great touchdown"" they will say something situationally relevant like ""that's his second touchdown today""
GAMEPLAY - perfect. The game runs slow enough that you can actually read blocks, watch the defensive coverage develop, etc. Its amazing to run the ball and actually follow a pulling guard, versus other games where you just look for daylight
OVERALL - amazing game. Not only do you get the typical game mode, but you also get mini-camp mode and 2-minute drill which are brief and highly addictive. And best of all - ONLINE PLAY! That's right, you can challenge anyone in the world to a game of Madden at anytime"
4268,5,This is one of the best games I have. I highly recomend it. Good first shooter game. It is easy to play.
4269,5,I got this case i nthe inital Intro bundle. It has protected my vita as I have traveled around. Good to put a few games in there. Reccommended.
4270,5,"Well I'm here to say do not listen to the low star reviews about this amazing expansion of a game. First off if you platiumed the original diablo 3 and are trophy hunters its all new trophies in this one. Now the crusader character is amazing to play with I already got him to level 63 and he's a beast all of his moves are very supportive and they deal a lot of damage to the baddies. Now for the campaign I will cover only act V and so forth because the rest of the campaign remains the same. Act V has a bunch of new enemies to beat up and loot from and they all look amazing I love their design(kudos blizzard) anyway you basically have to kick the butt of the Angel of Death Malthael who is disgusted with the way humans are so he wantsto slaughter them all and purge sanctuary. That's where you come in if you choose the crusader there is some interesting dialogue, also you find out about the crusaders order and background. Finally, what makes this game a pretty much buy instantly, and worth the $40 is adventure mode! It is really amazing because you can teleport to any act and part of that act to complete bounties. After you complete 5 bounties you get a rift stone key that opens a rift to a randomly generated dungeon that yields some very strong legendary I know first hand because my guys attack is 109k with 568k defence so I know haha but I still have trouble fighting most because I am playing on torment lvl1 difficulty to get even better loot. One final thing in act V you get a mystic that allows you to change the way your armor looks to fully customize you character however you like its a very amazing feature. She also can enchant your items which I haven't done much of so I won't comment. Anyway buy this game adventure mode and the mystic alone is what made me re-buy this day one. (From GameStop)"
4271,5,"Freelancer is one of my favorite games of all time. I just got into the MOD scene with Freelancer and there are so many MODs out there it's hard to choose. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes GOOD single player storylines, space flight/combat sims (with stunning outer space graphics), and free roaming type of games. Shame on Microsoft for not making a sequel! If you're going to buy this game I would definitely check out the various MODs that will improve the game. Google search ""Moddb"", you can find more information about the different Freelancer MODs.

Here are some MODs that I have heard good things about:

-Crossfire - The story mode is harder on this one and the graphics have been improved.
-Discovery Freelancer
-Shattered Worlds: War Torn
-Freeworlds: Tides of War - A Star Wars conversion-Comes out 2012
-The UnderVerse - A Chronicles of Riddick conversion"
4272,5,"I come from a gaming family and my new family is also big on video games. The Nintendo Wii is the only console I have ever seen that really and truly appeals to absolutely everyone I know in one way or another.

To give you a basic idea of the complete range of this system, the following people have played and enjoyed our Wii:
27 year old female (me), 28 year old male (hubby), 4 year old male (son), 22 year old male (brother, ended up buying himself one), 25 year old male (other brother), 52 year old female (mom), 58 year old male (dad), 25 year old female (sister in law), 26 year old female (friend), 31 year old male (friend), 27 year old female (friend), 30 year old male (friend), 15 year old female (cousin), 15 year old male (cousin, also got one for himself), 12 year old female (cousin), and many many many more.

Games like Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime, and Mario Kart keep my video game fanatic of a husband intrigued and challenged. Wii Sports has had everyone I know at least TRY (and thoroughly enjoy) the system which does not happen. This is the first time I have ever seen my mother play any type of video game and we have had video games in our house for decades. I love games like Mario Party and My Sims and am currently really getting a kick out of my Wii Fit as well. My four year old son adores the Wii Sports and the Mario Kart. My almost 2 year old daughter doesn't really care what's going on as long as she's holding on to a WiiMote.

This is definitely fun for the entire family. This is entertainment at its best-- people getting together and having a great time OR enjoying some time to yourself to unwind.

This is NOT progression in video gaming technology as far as competing with the XBox 360 or PS3. I think it's completely ridiculous to try and compare these systems. I can understand debating between an X Box or a PS 3 but the Wii is completely separate. This is not about amazing graphics and smooth controls, compelling story lines, and innovative plot development. This is a completely new way to play and should be seen that way.

I don't believe it's too kiddy for anyone. There are plenty of titles out there to appeal to all types of players and more are coming. This is by far the most rewarding video game purchase we have made and I have no qualms of continuing investing into it with each new title (Mario Kart with a wheel!) or feature (have I mentioned how much I adore the new Wii Fit?).

Thank you so much Nintendo. Keep it coming!"
4273,5,Great game for a great price.
4274,5,"I won't go into too many details here, but this game is quite fun!  The tutorial is excellent and the play is relatively easy...  The graphics are amazing!  This game will even be more fun if I ever get 4 people to play it.... Tons of replay value here!"
4275,5,"I thought that this game was really fun. I know that this is supposedly the best RTS game ever. Personally, I think that Age of Empires is a better game than Starcraft, but after AoE this is probably the best RTS game ever. I really love how challenging the campaigns are. I mean, I beat 'um, but they were hard."
4276,5,"I bought this product to after I bought my 1st rechargeable battery with the wire. Now having three of these at my disposal make playing with friends less of a hassle. All I have to do is just place one to charge, and constantly swap as needed.

Regardless, onto the product itself. It is very nice to have a 40 hour lasting battery and one that can be recharged. Sadly It doesn't come with the wire, but luckily I had one lying around from a previous order. I had a pleasant time with this purchase, so I didn't cross any problems that some other reviewers may have had.

I recommend buying this battery pack if you have the charging wire or dock to charge them with. They make wonderful replacements! Great for the avid gamer and even people who play with friends on the same console. I am so glad I purchased this, hopefully you will."
4277,5,"This game is OUTSTANDING and easily the best gears of war EVER!!!
I will break up my review to the 2 things most people care about, multiplayer and combat reviews.

COMBAT

Combat typically offers four options for weapons: a primary weapon, secondary weapon, pistol and grenade. Three other players are with the team, and they can be controlled by the computer or by others for co-op play, which is fun if you want to get a real feel for the campaign while enjoying the game with your friends.

The weapons have weight to them and feel powerful. Shooting from behind cover, one of the hallmarks of the franchise, is required as enemies appear from nearly every angle. You'll want to keep your head down.

Teamwork is key. Not only will a mate come to your rescue when you are down, they can also set up opportunities to flank your opponents and end battles quicker. It all flows naturally (much like the copious amounts of blood spilled in the battles) and is well-paced, with plenty of ammo and weapons to be scavenged and used.

The game helps new players along with a casual mode that highlights enemies and objectives for easier play. There is an ""aim-assist"" mode that will line up enemies if you have trouble getting those pesky Locusts in your crosshairs.

MULTIPLAYER

Six modes of multiplayer action offer all kinds of mission objectives beyond just killing the other team. Whether it's capturing and holding an enemy leader (while defending your own) or playing as one of the monsters against human opponents, variety will keep players entertained.

Dedicated servers around the world, which will host the multiplayer games, also will be available, fulfilling a common player desire from previous ""Gears of War"" games. Developers said this should eliminate the perception that players hosting multiplayer matches had an advantage over other players."
4278,5,"I'm new to the Resistance franchise and have been very impressed with this game. The single player campaign is great - reasonably tough with a nice variety of locations, weapons and enemies. The detail, atmosphere and ruin present in the levels is quite striking and goes along way to sell the story - that humanity's time is very close to ending. This is the first FPS I've played in a long time that I was compelled to finish quickly. The entire way through I felt that I was fighting for something - not just mindlessly shooting baddies.  The multiplayer is pretty stellar - the variety and balance of weapons is excellent, the level design is top notch and there are a good variety of multiplayer game modes. The only issues I've had in multiplayer are team balance (a patch is coming to address that) and some sparsely populated matches here and there. Check out this title if you're looking for a great shooter with a compelling story and fun multiplayer."
4279,5,"I actually bought this game for my three years old son.
he had fun and me to guiding him through it."
4280,5,great
4281,5,"This game is amazing ... the graphics are superb, and you really get a feeling of flying down the hill.  this game is a total blast.  the physics feel real for the most part with a bit of an extreme edge -- gravity is a bit lite, but hey, its a game.
definite thumb's up!"
4282,5,Great!!!
4283,5,I get the play the game and watch the movie on the game
4284,5,"Game works, Fast shipping"
4285,5,"Gameplay

On The Battlefield
If you have played even a single Dynasty Warriors game then you will find the gameplay here very familiar. You take charge of one of many historical Chinese characters and hack and slash your way through thousands of helpless peons , with the occasional officer putting a bit more of a fight. On harder difficulties you will have to use a bit more strategy, such as conquering bases, cutting off enemy's supply lines or new to DW8E using ""stratagems"". Stratagems are unique skills that you can use during a battle and can easily turn the tide in your favor. Some skills can help your allies like ""Unity"" which heals you and any ally near you while others hurt your enemies like ""Fire Arrows"". You can equip up to four stratagems to use during a battle and each can only be used once. There are many skills to choose from but not all are available to you, depending on the ""Fame"" of the character you are using you get a different set of stratagems. Fame is your character's personality, there are six different Fame types, ""Orderly"" , ""Kind"" , ""Evil"" , ""Brave"" , ""Affluent"" and ""Wise"".

Empire Mode
Empire is the main mode in the game. You begin by choosing one of over a hundred characters or even you own created one. There are five different scenarios to choose from, such as Yellow Turban Rebellion and Battle of Chbi, although not much changes from scenario to another except for the officers who will appear during your campaign. There is also one (yes just one) ""Story"" battle unique to each campaign. There are three main ways to play, as a ruler, free officer or subordinate. Playing as a ruler gives you the most abilities and freedom. You can choose to invade another kingdom any time you wish to. You can also employ/hire free officers to build up your army and use ""Diplomacy"" like striking an alliance with another kingdom. Your ultimate goal is to conquer every territory and unite China under one Kingdom, yours. But of course you will have to overcome other rulers trying to do the same thing. The game is turn based, each turn concludes when you take any action, recruiting an officer, invading a kingdom, or even just interacting with one of your officers will end your turn which also causes one-month to pass. I do find it odd that invading a territory passes one month, and speaking with one of my officers also takes a month..anyway, how you choose to play is up to you. You can be very aggressive and focus on taking territories, or build up your army and strengthen your defenses. You will find that other kingdoms love to invade your territories quite often, the game gives you three turns to enter a defensive battle and win it or that territory is lost. This can be a bit frustrating as you find yourself having to play defensive battles a lot. You can avoid this by appointing a ""prefect"" to each of your territories, when one of your territories with an appointed prefect is invaded the game will tell you that your prefect is leading the defense and attempting to repel the invasion..of course if 3 turns passes and your prefect fails to repel the invasion that territory is lost. This is a risk you will have to take if you want to avoid playing in defensive battles. When you take over every kingdom, the campaign ends and you get a rather disappointingly short 2 minutes ending. There are six different ending for each Fame type.

Playing as a free officer is quite different that playing as a ruler. You can recruit other free officers to join you and form your own vigilante unit. As a vigilante leader you can't invade other kingdoms but you can join an army going into an invasion, or engage in a ""skirmish"" to earn gold . You can choose to ""Raise your own banner"" basically overthrowing the prefect in the territory you're currently in and take the land for yourself and becoming a ruler yourself in the process. You can also choose to serve a kingdom and then you will become a subordinate. As a subordinate, your options are quite limited, you will take orders from your ruler, impress him/her enough and you may get promoted to a prefect or even strategist. As a prefect you will be charged in the protection of a territory and as a strategist you will gain the ability to suggest courses of actions to your ruler such as invading a certain kingdom or requesting reinforcements.

There are many ways to play Empire mode that each campaign feels a little different. You can be a ruthless Evil ruler, execute every officer you capture, raise taxes frequently to gain more gold, and betray your allies. Or you can be benevolent, invest in your kingdom, donate to the poor villages, form alliances with other kingdoms and release/hire captured officers. You can even choose to just be a common officer, do your job and free yourself from all the duties and burdens of being a ruler , like having to constantly defend your territories or building an army. This freedom is what makes the Empire games stands out from the other more linear Dynasty Warriors games. It's sort of like the GTA of DW.

Edit Mode
I know many who are willing to buy a game just for such a feature, luckily this is the best Create-A-Warrior in any DW game yet. You can customize everything, height and weight, hair style and color, scars and tattoos etc , there are dozens of clothes and equipment to choose from although many have to be unlocked using Bonus Points you gain by beating Empire mode. You can give your created character his/her ""Main"" weapon and also choose what their Fame is. You can create as many as you want, and you can even allow them to appear in Empire mode. You can also upload your created characters online so they appear in other people's game.

Graphics and Sound
Dynasty Warriors games were never known for their great visuals and sadly this isn't any different. The game looks almost identical to DW8 officers and weapons do look a bit better thanks to some added details, and the game runs very smooth never dropping frame rate even when the action gets hectic. The game is fully voiced..in Japanese, unfortunately there is no English dub. This was done as a cost-cutting measure according to Koei. At least they didn't hold back with the music, the game features dozens of music tracks from many older DW games, like DW2, DW3 etc this is especially awesome for long time fans who will instantly recognize their favorites from past DW titles. Of course if you never liked DW's rock/techno music to begin with there is not much in here that will change your mind.

Overall
While Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires does not revolutionize the series nor cure all of its problems , it does address the biggest issue that plague the typical DW game: repetition by adding much needed strategy elements and allowing the player a lot more freedom in how to play the game. Recommended"
4286,5,"good story, enjoyable, will play it again"
4287,5,"This has made the oculus that much better to mess around with, it seems to real and the items are heavy duty.  They arrived quickly and have worked great."
4288,5,Perfict condition

What I like most about them is that they thought of a lot of the little details that gamers might be looking for in a product like this. You can see some of those details in the video but here are some things that stood out for me:

1.  Very easy to control volume control and mic muting on the left and right side of the headphones. They are large dials that can be adjusted easily without having to hunt around for a remote on the wire or something like that.

2.  They include a fairly decent quality USB sound card in the box for use with PCs. This helps to control some of the specific features of the headphones but also provide consistent audio quality even for lower end computers.

3.  It's also possible to connect the headset directly to a computer or mobile device with included adapter cables.

4.  You can plug a buddy's headphones into the bottom of these, basically a built in splitter.

5.  Another buddy can connect to the sound card too.

6. The microphone will mute itself when it's stowed inside the left ear cup.

The audio quality for gaming is great. Very deep, booming bass. Audiophiles will want to look elsewhere as these really lack the clarity for serious music listening."
4291,5,"This game has taken hours and days to play.  Once you start it is addicting and you will need to tell yourself that it is time to go to bed.  There are so many details in the game, so many steps to take, so many things you can do....it seems the game can be played for years.

My wife, kids and I have all played and at times fight for ""whose turn it is""."
4292,5,"A fun, easy-to-grasp game.  Pretty much what you can expect.

For some interesting fun (and a reason to shout at your best friend) try the (interesting) multiplayer."
4293,5,perfect condition
4294,5,"I've always thought Rockstar was one-step from making GTA into a perfect game but they always had to get too cute with GTA. Not with RDR, even the Undead DLC is a ton of fun. What's more fun than jumping on an automatic mounted chain-machine gun and mowing down hordes of zombies? I think a big part of the fun with RDR is the main character John. Unlike GTA, especially V, you don't feel a polarizing feeling towards John. The story and his backstory draws you in. You could be just like him .. you know, if you lived in the old west. You're going to get attached to the character, his family and you'll even enjoy the parts that normally would feel repetitive. I will say Skyrim and Fallout are also good at doing this. All video games, in my 30+ years of gaming, become boring. They drag. It's going to happen but if the developer can make you feel like you're accomplishing something for your character, you don't notice it as much. RDR does that. I'll give an example with GTA. I really like the GTA games but I eventually get tired of ""playing by the rules"". Like when GTA San Andreas had you destroying the comic book guy's remote helicopter toys and you had to use a remote helicopter toy to do it. In RDR, there's no real restrictions, if you can kill those legendary animals with a knife, have at it. Want to throw dynamite at them? You can. Or you find them from a distance, get your Carcano Rifle out and try to snipe the elusive beast.

My teenage son said it best, ""Everything in it feels epic"". I think that's what makes this game so great. From the side challenges like trying to skin X amount of a certain wild animal to trying to poke a knife between your fingers in a QTE game to my personal favorite moment of the game. You've just realized you have a bunch of animal skins to sell but haven't saved. Then you hear it. The sound of a cougar attacking. Those will kill you before you can get your gun pulled, kill your horse too. It's such a fun, intense moment in a usually mid-paced game. The characters throughout the game are either crazy or hilarious or both. Just wait until you have to run behind the bank and hunt the critters. It's a relatively violent, harsh game that doesn't use gore or shock to make it violent. It's almost like an old west simulator. I've had Red Dead Redemption 2 preordered since last summer. Even worse, I decided to switch from the XB1 to PS4, so now I'm going to have to cancel my XB1 preorder and preorder it on PS4. I would rate it as one of the greatest games ever made. The game that comes the closest in old west style is Gun. Nowhere near as challenging as RDR but similar gameplay and setting. By the way, it works great on BC. I've played it all the way through twice on 360, once on XB1 BC and wouldn't be surprised if I try it on PS Now."
4295,5,"Now if you are a fan or those 2-D games and stuff like that, you probably will think this is a disgrace for the N64. I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.
Overall, this game has great sound effects, music, weapons, items, charaters, abilities, an okay storyline, excellent graphics and just a really good play!"
4296,5,"I bought this after my original charger broke (torn cable, accident).  It's effective, does what it's supposed to do."
4297,5,"Note: I have played through the main story and am now working on side missions (like the past games).

When Arkham Asylum came out, I was amazed. I've played a variety of pretty crappy Batman games throughout my life, and this one had raised the bar, it was stellar, and everything I thought I could want from a Batman game.

When Arkham City came out, my previous thoughts were blown out of the water. Arkham City had this incredible open-world, non-linear gameplay style that worked surprisingly well for such a story-driven Batman game. The gameplay was smooth, fun, challenging when you needed it to be, and the story was impressive - to say the least.

I felt Arkham City was the standard for the series. Whatever botched attempt Arkham Origins was, it just didn't live up to the previous games. And then Arkham Knight came out. And, wow, they gave me what I wasn't asking for and it was exactly what I needed.

I admit, I didn't follow much of the game's hype or news before its release. All I knew is that I would play it, and see how I felt afterwards. Apart from some minor glitches (which, yes, similar to those that existed in the previous games as well), the game was phenomenal. The story - and more importantly, the way the game made you play the story - had me on the edge of my seat at times. The gameplay was what I came to love from Arkham City, yet expanded upon. It was smooth, easy to command, and easy to pick back up on after having not played an Arkham game in some time. The side-missions are a hoot, and very fun.

The Batmobile aspect is a blast! I've seen some complaints about it - what is there to complain about? First, the Batmobile is an important part of the Batman canon. Second, its basically an indestructible mini-tank. The controls may seem sloppy at first, but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy to navigate around the city, even at top speeds. The open-world itself is pretty massive, yet easy to get from A-to-B without much hassle.

If you at all enjoyed Arkham City or Arkham Asylum, this NEEDS to be your next game. Forget whatever issues you've heard about, this is just a VERY fun game. You will enjoy every second of it if you don't stop to criticize what they did or didn't do wrong. Why pass on a chance to play such a fun and entertaining game?"
4298,5,"I have owned this game since day one and used to play it all the time until me and my friends finally got burnt out of it.  Now nearly a year later I have decided to pop it back into the tray.  Boy had I forgotten just how much fun this game is!  Its so fun in fact, that I decided to go onto amazon and rate the game!

I have played some of the old splinter cell games, but wasn't much into them.  This new style is great for the franchise and is breathing new life into the series!  The Mark and Execute feature is by far my favorite.  Sam fisher has never been a bigger bad a$$ :)

Also, deniable ops adds a great deal of extra replayability to the title.

This game is a GREAT deal especially considering the price is now under $20!

If you haven't gotten it already, get it now!

Thanks for reading"
4299,5,This game is pretty good. It has a long time for gameplay. It isn't too difficult but it is a classic Zelda Game..
4300,5,"I'm not a Star Wars fan, and was a little skeptical after reading all the reviews BUT IT'S AS GOOD AS A GAME GETS! The graphics are great! You can interact with just about everything you see, and choose what to say to other characters! This game defines role-playing, from fights to unlocking doors to hacking computer systems it's role-playing to the max! There are nine ""party members"" that follow you throughout the game! You can learn to use the force and different powers! You gain experience to level up along with your party members! Becoming LIGHT or DARK is completely up to you. There's alternate endings and an incredible story line! You feel as if your in a movie with the great plot, graphics, and choice of destiny(LIGHT OR DARK)! You get to travel all over the galaxy to about 7 different planets! There's the main story line as well as like 10 separate ""missions"" for each planet! This game is great! KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC has more weapons, options, armor and just overall more everything than any other game out there! This is the best role-playing game out there and is definitely one of the best games out there! Don't play this game if you don't have time to spare! It will suck you in! If you do have time then this is a MUST BUY! Do your self a favor and buy this game! If you don't believe me then rent it, but don't be shocked when you look at the clock and it 2 in the morning! This definitly deserves a 5 out of 5!"
4301,5,"I thought these were too big @1st,but got used to them really quickly.i used that strong Gorilla-glue on mines so they don't twist/pop off! which they will in a fast paced/evn fight games! so i recommend u CAREFULLY GLUE these on.i shaved off quite a bit off the old thumbstick rubber off my old xbox 360 sticks,so they fit bettr&are much easier to put on now too! remember to use a good very grippy rubber cement type glue! unless u want these falling off/ur dog chews them aftr they fall on floor lol.dont let the glue squish out all over too.use a wet towel ASAP to get excess ok?trust me...i ordered the gorilla glue,because it super strong(make sure its the yellowish weird color-NOT their SUPER GLUE type!!)super glue gets brittle so do NOT USE it!!!i tried.ps:ur fingers don't sweat as much to i notice.def recommend these grips!"
4302,5,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it. He's a big Legend of Zelda fan, so he was thrilled."
4303,5,"alot to do in this game, and its fun"
4304,5,"Great fun when you have friends over for a party!!! It makes you work. May not help your confidence in dance steps, but works on your eye and feet coordination!! A must!!"
4305,5,"I was excited to buy the new Just Dance 3, since I have 1 and 2...and of course I love it! I really like the new Sweat Mode too. It picks out songs for you to dance too, which I love because I had no idea which songs would give me the most sweat.

The ONLY downside that I have is that I don't really know a lot of the songs haha...although, I'm giving it a shot anyway! Who knows, I could find a new favorite dance song!"
4306,5,"The PS2 had some of the best games that any gaming console has had to date, and for me FFX was right at the top. At least in the top 5, if not 2 or 3. It has a excellent story, great characters, and most everything about it is great and good at its worst. It's graphics were revolutionary when it was released 13 years ago. It amazes me playing this game and seeing how far we've come when I use to think this games graphics couldn't get much better. Still the few HD cut scenes are pretty damn good graphic wise even today. I use to love FFX. It was and is an excellent RPG.

FFX-2 is overly girly, and you feel kind of weird being a grown man playing it, but the game-play itself is actually really fun, and it's story is well written, and you might start to enjoy playing it if you can get over it's silliness at certain moments in the game. Some of it seems like it was made for 8 year old girls to enjoy playing something like that is what I'm trying to say.

I'm very glad Square Enix did a remake of these games. I've completed 100% of everything there is to do in both games several times, and I've probably played threw FFX 8-10 times. I haven't played them in years though so it takes me back I guess.

If you are a FFX fan, or even just someone who enjoys playing a good RPG then I can't recommend buying this game/games enough."
4307,5,"I think Jungle Storm and Island Thunder are almost the same. Niether of them are better than one other,but they are such great games. If you own a Xbox you will say Island Thunder is better and PS2 owners will say that Jungle Storm is better!!! Hey I once was a biased Xbox gamer,but then I bought a PS2 and now I'm an unbiased gamer So I'm in the middle here and saying each game has it's own qualites to go by!!!Well if you want to solve all  of your problems buy both systems well if you have enough money that is!!!So here's the facts Island Thunder has slightly better missions while Jungle Storm has better multi-player options.
Game Play: Great!!! 4/5
Graphics: Just like Island Thunder awesome!!!5/5
Muti-Player: Mega Awesome!!!5/5*****
Replay Value: Something you will always remember!!!5/5
I personaly give this game 4.8/5!!!An awesome game!!!
I also reccomend:
Ghost Recon Island Thunder: 4.8/5 Xbox
Ghost Recon Desert Siege: 4.8/5  PC"
4308,5,The whole family loves to play this game.  It is great entertainment and fun!  I would defintely recommend this game to anyone who loves Wii Sports.
4309,5,"I've owned this game for a couple of years now and I still end up going back to it. My son doesn't understand that but it is like playing a board game. You don't play Axis & Allies once and then say you beat it and never play again. That is what this game is for me. A great strategy game that you can go back to after its been on the shelf for a while and enjoy a game here or there or get re-addicted to it.

+Turn Based
+Casual
+Fun
+Play a scenario in 2-4 hours and you are done.

One of my most played games of all time.

And no, it isn't like Skyrim."
4310,5,Fantastic game! If you enjoyed the 2013 reboot you'll love this.
4311,5,"I really enjoyed the first game, and I think the second is great too! You play as Solid Snake in the introduction, on a tanker, and the rest of the game as Raiden, a new MGS character. Many people hate this game because of Raiden, but I think it's great! Raiden brings in a new age of MGS, in the sense that this is the game when the world gets bigger. The story is more convoluted, and complex. But, there are also many pros. It looks good, still to this day, and the gameplay tweaks (mostly using weapons in first-person) are greatly appreciated. It's  a great game, and I recommend it!"
4312,5,The singleplayer is incredible. The multiplayer is fun. I will say it gets a little boring after a while. I've gone back to playing bf4 because it is still a more fun game than this one. But this is still worth the money
4313,5,"Bought one for my gaming/design desktop. Loved it. Wife tried it, she loved it. We bought another one for her to game on. My 5 year old tried it and wanted one. We're up to 3. Now I bought 2 more as backups in case of damage. If one family loves it enough to buy 5 within a year that should be pretty good indication. Great mouse, worth the money. Buy it!

Update: bought 3 more for the office staff to use. They love it too. The finish seems to change a bit from mouse to mouse, I preferred the one w/ a bit more texture."
4314,5,Gift for my grandson He loves these little guys
4315,5,"My son ordered this with his birthday money, He said it is in great shape and no problems,."
4316,5,:)
4317,5,"Game can be very addictive, once you figure out to play.  Easily multiplayer friendly from same game system or over the internet."
4318,5,Great game
4319,5,my son won't put this down..
4320,5,thank you!
4321,5,Great game.  Feels old school and yet new at the same time.  One of the best games of 2016 for sure.
4322,5,Grand son likes it
4323,5,Fun game. Cool little side story from the main show.
4324,5,"My favorite game on the Vita. Its a little short as I platinumed it in about 10 hours or so but the entire time it was a joy to play. This is a lot like littlebigplanet but where LBP excels in multiplayer, this game is an excellent single player experience."
4325,5,"Link is my favorite Nintendo character. This amiibo has a great attention to detail, as most do."
4326,5,"Just got it another MCI game, to cool for school! This helped make my summer fun! and it got here so fast tooo!!!!! Thanks Amazon:)"
4327,5,"This is one of the best covers that I've ever seen for the PlayStation 3. Foamy Lizard has really set the standard for quality here. I'm thoroughly impressed at how snug this fits my console, with even the curve of the Slim model molded perfectly in the front. The quality of the fabric is great, with the stitching all the way around is well done too. I'm also impressed with the consideration for the cabling in the back of the unit, with it slightly cut out to compensate for that. Too many other covers are simply that, but this one fits exactly like a glove; Not too tight, and not too loose.

I'll certainly be purchasing covers from this company, and the quality alone was worth the price I paid for it. I highly recommend this cover to anyone looking for one. Two thumbs up!"
4328,5,This one is full of special effects and keeps you interested both in the history idea and finding clues as to what you need to find. The raven is cool and I fond it relatively easy but not simple. Would purchase another of its kind.
4329,5,Exactly as expected.
4330,5,My game stopped working after like a week. WTF...
4331,5,"I recently borrowed this game from my freind thinking it was going to be a boring warcraft/starcraft wannabe what I got was even better than I expected! There are 13 races to choose from each with different characters and buildings so they is unlimited gameplay. Sometimes the battles can be difficult and frustrating but you always find yourself coming back for more.
The greatest Strategy game of all time. Period. With no doubt!"
4332,5,"This is seriously my third account. I now have my Wife, Father, and Sister all playing WoW on the same server. Great game, completely addictive."
4333,5,"The original Super Mario Bros was basically the reason I became a gamer.

Like a baseball fan that remembers the inhuman like leap to catch a home-run ball in right field during the 1991 World Series (Kirby Puckett we miss ya) or those football lovers who replay the catch in their mind between Joe Montana and Dwight Clark as a reason they love their sport of choice today  that was what Super Mario Bros was to me.

As a kid who was in his basement of his very modestly rented house growing up, the Atari was a lifeline of fun when I was not outside on my Big wheel. With that being said, it was not until my mother rented a Nintendo Entertainment System with Super Mario Bros that I realized how far gaming could go...and this was just the beginning.

We were so excited. My brother and I stayed up all night playing it. That first night, I remember even having a bad dream about how SCARY Bowser was at the end of each stage. But it is those memories from a very young age that stick with me. That recall was something that happened to me nearly 25+ years ago, and yet, I remember it like it was yesterday.

The graphics were nothing we had seen before. The level of control was WAY better than my old Atari 2600. Right when you pushed start, you knew you were going to have a great time with that intro music.

As time passed, you became better at the game. You talked about it with your friends at school and neighbors. There was always that kid that said you could jump over the flag pole and no one ever believed him or talking about how you got so many lives on level 3-1 bouncing that poor turtle over and over against the platform.

When you finished Super Mario Bros the first time, you had so much pride. You were then challenged to play again, but this time, was going to be harder. But you did it. You and your friends would try to see how many times in a row you could beat the gameleaving it on for countless hours and even days for some. (We didn't have saves back then kids)

It was fun watching my son try to play his first Mario game, but I made sure it was not a Wii Mario or a Wii U Mario. I wanted him to see how far we have come in gameplay, but to understand how truly great, challenging yet fun the original Super Mario Bros was.

Sure enough, my son played for a while and did not do well, but I could see the similar reactions that he had that I once had when I was his age. Jumping into a pit when you had Flower Power. The landing just next to the enemy on a long jump but jumping just in time to not get hit. The urgency. The fear of losing 1 more precious life.

He didn't complete the game that day, and to this day, still has not I do not think. I didn't care. I just  wanted to make sure he knew gaming is what it is today because of Super Mario Bros. Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Halo or the countless hugely successful X franchise game out there, the Original Super Mario Bros is the reason why gaming is the biggest medium in history of entertainment.

So to write a true review about Super Mario Bros is almost irrelevant. The reality, it is the game that gave birth to the title of gamer, and I for one am proud to be one."
4334,5,"I gotta tell ya, in all of the racing games I've played, this one's gotta be the hardest of them all. I've never had to fight for my life so much just to win a single race. However, it's all definitely worth it, because this game rocks us all.
The graphics are gorgeous, the control, the feel of the game, and the fact that it can interact with the arcade version is a nice touch. I warn you though, this game is fast, and it may take a while before you master it. This is no ordinary futuristic racing. Wipeout Fusion has nothing on this."
4335,5,Fra Cry 3 is the best one so far. you need to get the first 2. I love this game.
4336,5,I Loved. Excelent product.
4337,5,Good game...
4338,5,"When you start playing this game, I hope you have tons of spare time ahead of you, because it will rob you of said time. This game is very addicting and you will not want to put it down. From farming to dungeon crawling, fishing and even romance. This game has a little bit of everything and will pander to people of all tastes. I give it 5 stars."
4339,5,"This game has a lot to offer:

Single player, multiplayer, split screen, an interesting storyline, terrific visuals, lots of action, easy to use controls, reasonable checkpoints, a wagon load of weapons, and a smooth game play without buggy glitches or freezing.  I wouldn't recommend renting this one because you might feel compelled to finish the game as quick as you can without experiencing the game for what it is.  For what I paid and got out of it RFOM has delivered. I'm not saying RFOM is a game that you need to have, just that the one I own won't be on craigslist anytime soon."
4340,5,"awesome borderlands 2 GOTY edition is great you'll see some weird strange things in the wastlands

there's quite a few things gearbox could have did better with this game when you play online with others who aren't your friends can steal the loot you killed the enemy for gets very annoying, the Krieg Character can be hurt by team mates gun fire and nova shield blasts so watch out all the other characters in the game can't be hurt or taken out by nova shield blasts?

the game offers online play
online friends only
invite friends only
public
lan
offline

despite some of the problems stated above its a great game even for the GOTY edition."
4341,5,Bought for my son for Christmas last year and he loved it. He was happy to get it since he loves the cartoon show quite a lot.
4342,5,perfect
4343,5,As described
4344,5,This game is fun. Great price.
4345,5,"its a lovely story, a very good game, if you can buy it don't miss it because your gonna regreat it later"
4346,5,"Even if you're unfamiliar with Games Workshop, miniatures games in general or the Warhammer 40,000 universe (sometimes simply and affectionately called ""40K"") this game should knock your socks off. The graphics are stupendous and the action during the battles is absolutely visceral and spectacular. PC Gamer magazine has given this game three highly favorable preview reviews so far this year and the 17-minute video shown at E3 and at Games Workshop's Games Day has amazed all who gazed upon it. When I watched the video at Games Day in May 2004 people actually responded audibly to the scene of the Bloodthirster (huge winged demon) taking possession of a Chaos Space Marine and then cheered at the spectacular scene of the Space Marine Captain leaping upon the Bloodthirster's shoulders and taking him down with his huge power hammer.
The game designers are so good that each of the ""races"" in Dawn of War have their own ""feel"" based on the Games Workshop mythology of the tabletop game, and not just in combat either. Even the gait of the soldiers is different from race to race: the Orks lope brutishly, the Eldar run in a graceful disciplined way and the Space Marines and Chaos Marines fall somewhere in between, marching in a forceful and orderly manner. It's the same in combat where the Orks thump and pound, the Eldar perform amazingly graceful and lethal martial arts moves and the Marines are powerful and straightforward. Even the fighting machines of each race follow this careful design and are amazing to see; Eldar Wraithlords, Space Marine Dreadnoughts, Land Raiders, Rhinos, Chaos Defilers, they are all here and behave in a manner consistent with the other troops in their army. Even if you're unfamiliar with 40K, you're in for a treat. Dawn of War promises to be one of the best RTS computer games ever regardless of whether or not you are into the Games Workshop tabletop miniatures hobby. Dawn of War stands on its own as an amazing and exciting science fiction/fantasy battle game like no other before it. If you are familiar with 40K, be prepared to see the 40K universe spring to life before your eyes like never before.

4347,5,It was just what I was looking for and needed. Product was exactly as described above. Would recommend to others.
4348,5,Best PC controller currently available. So much customization! You can access any app or game with this controller. You could literally use your computer using soul this controller. So wonderful.
4349,5,Great game!
4350,5,came perfect and fast shipping
4351,5,Product is working as described. However I have yet to really test it out as I do not have any games that really require the kinect besides the voice function. It is nice that it is up and out of the way though. I also enjoy the fact it comes with a privacy screen over the camera. However I have to get up and remove it for it to recognize me to log in every time. That is the only drawback however if you want to block the camera only option.
4352,5,"Great for fighting games! Doesnt feel cheap, I use it on my PC and PS3!"
4353,5,good game
4354,5,I just got the game and I am going to try it out today! I CAN'T WAIT! YAY! Thanks so very much! Great prices by the way!
4355,5,"Just as described, my son was very happy with this product when he opened the package.  Well worth the money."
4356,5,"This game is a bit older but still looks really good the best thing about it, it runs in windows 8. The only bad side it comes with that star force which can pain to get it to work if your running windows 8 going to need to update this at there site you can find it by typing it into a search engine."
4357,5,Great replacement from the original factory installed one.
4358,5,We love Captain America. He is our second highest leveled character. That is only because he does not cross over to other playsets. His shield attack is hard to dodge. His special move obliterates the bad guys. His super jump rivals the Hulk. This is a strong character and a must have for avengers fans.
4359,5,OF COURSE I HAVE THIS WHOLE SERIES... I PLAYED MY FIRST COPY OF GEARS 2 SO MUCH THAT THE DISK STOPPED BEING ABLE TO BE READ WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS COPY... AS SOON AS I CAN DRAG MYSELF AWAY FROM PART 3 I WILL DEFINITELY GET BACK INTO PLAYING PART 2
4360,5,"Great product, just as advertised. Highly recommend. AAA+++"
4361,5,I liked the whole dead space series and this did not disappoint me the end was a bit of a let down but  al lgood  thinsg come to an end
4362,5,Grandson loved it!
4363,5,Perfect for smaller hands. So much better accuracy!
4364,5,This has a great new ip and will get even better
4365,5,Great
4366,5,really good controller and settings are very well put. cant go back to a regular controller its too weird
4367,5,great
4368,5,"This set of three Splatoon amiibo is a recolor of the previously released set. It is important to note that these three amiibo have IDENTICAL function with the original three Splatoon amiibo. So if you own that set, don't expect any new functionality out of these amiibo.

That said, these are some of my favorite amiibo designs, and the recolors are exceptional. Not only has the color of the ""hair"" and ""guns"" changed, but the design on the shirts are different, the skin tones are varied from the original models (Hey, we got a dark skinned inkling guys! And a pale skinned one! We did it!), et cetera.

As far as functions go, just like the originals, these unlock special single player stages in the game (the same exact stages as the originals, in fact, with exactly the same rewards). Also important to note for amiibo enthusiasts, these do NOT unlock alternate color costumes from the original squid kid amiibo trio in Mario Maker.

If you're into these figures for their appearance, these are some of the best and I highly recommend them. I actually like these colors better than the original set. If you only care about functionality and already have the original set, skip these ones."
4369,5,"I purchased this bundle because I wanted an extra PS3 around the house to use when friends came over so we could play some multiplayer stuff together.  I currently own 3 PS3s including this one. I have an original backwards compatible model and a 160GB model...I've stored the backwards compatible one because they can be a bit expensive to get your hands on these days.

The bundle is great and it comes with a slim version of the Blu-Ray/Universal remote.  I use this remote for the PS3, my receiver, and my TV (all Sony devices) and it works wonderfully.  I traded in both of the games that came with it because I had no interest in them and used that to get a different game.  The slim PS3 is neat and doesn't take up as much space and I can barely tell its on when my living room is silent.

I'm not sure why a vertical stand is shown in the picture but the bundle did not include this.  It did include a free month of PS+ though and I knew ahead of time the stand wasn't included, so I'm not complaining, just pointing it out for anyone else who is curious.  This probably is one of the best deals out there for a new PS3, if not the best deal.

I'd recommend this for anyone in the market to buy a PS3.  If you're not interested in the games just do what I did and turn them in towards something else."
4370,5,Fun game.
4371,5,"It's not often that I get to play a game that I really like these days. Most modern games are rehashed sequels or just another addition to a tired old franchise...boring...but Portal is truly unique. It's a great game and it's definitely not what you'd expect when people call it a ""puzzle"" game.

The elements that make this game so much fun are the combination of interesting puzzle challenges in the form of ""chambers"" and humor. Each level is a new chamber that you must traverse by figuring out where to place the portal, moving cubes around and later on avoiding hostile entities.

Throughout the game , you hear the monotonous, robotic voice of GLaDOS - the super computer AI who is running the show. ""She"" gives you some advice every now and then, but more often than not, makes funny comments about your predicament. I particularly like the part with the ""companion cube"", which is more than just a normal cube. You'll see what I mean if you play the game.

If there is a complaint about the game, it's the length. The game is short - really short. I played from start to finish in about 3 hours. I think the puzzles are challenging enough in the later levels but almost too easy for the first 5-10 levels. Challenging, but never really difficult.

All in all I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a game that is fun, not frustrating and satisfyingly entertaining. Looking forward to Portal 2 whenever it's finally out! I just hope it maintains that stark, sterile feel and humor that the first one had.

""The cake is a lie!"""
4372,5,Some cool add on gear for the game
4373,5,"Mega Man 5 game boy is one of the best Mega Man games for any fan of Mega Man. This rare game is one of my favorites included Mega Man 7. It started when Mega Man defeated Wily again. Then few months later, Mega Man and Roll are strolling in the park and they met a mysterious robot named Terra. Mega Man tried to harm Terra, but his buster had no effect on the evil robot. Terra almost killed Mega Man, luckily he was saved by Light. Light upgraded Mega Man's buster into the most powerful weapon of all of Mega Man's weapons: the Mega Arm. The Mega Arm is so strong and whenever Mega Man fires it, it can grab enemies destroying them, it can grab items that Mega Man cannot reach. Few days later after Mega Man was defeated by Terra, he heard a annoucment about a race of robots from space called Stardroids included Terra wanted to destroy Earth. If you are a fan of Mega Man, buy it."
4374,5,Great game. If you love rpgs get this game.
4375,5,excellence
4376,5,I remember playing this game 2 decades ago when I was a little kid. The music for this game is a bit catchy as well. I'm in my early 20's & still enjoying the Super Mario Bros saga. Any of the Super Mario Bros games is great to play by both old & young generations.
4377,5,"I bought this because i had a wireless controller and it works amazing. Just plug it in. Let windows 7 download and install drivers. push the button on the dongle. Push the button on the xbox 360 wireless controller at the top (next to RB). BAM!! Connected. List of games im playing with this puppy. Batman Arkham. Deadspace. Deadlight. GTA 4. Black ops 2. Binary Domain. Bioshock. many many others.

The dongle is very responsive. No lag. No nothing."
4378,5,"Got this for my son. He loves it. Plays his games without bringing the house down. He can't hear us talking to him but he probably likes that feature. After adjusting the mic and other volume settings it is very good sound. We had a cheap wireless headset before this blows it out of the water. I may have to steal these to watch TV myself.
It lost it's connection to the Bluetooth TV sound adapter once after he let the battery die. Was easy to connect back up by power cycling the adapter press the connection button then the turn off the headset. Hold the power button on the headset two beeps three beeps and then two beeps and it reconnected."
4379,5,"At first my husband had a little trouble putting it together. Once he got it right, he has had so much fun with it. The stand is very sturdy and wheel is just like driving a car. It is built very strong and put together well."
4380,5,Awesome game ! Always have loved the Lego games.
4381,5,loved it
4382,5,Both of my kids loved this special edition character. His animations and silly look left them in fits of laughter and the conquered the bad guys.
4383,5,Perfect.
4384,5,"Overall it was pretty good buy. Worked on my Windows 7, if you're wondering. I didn't think it would but it did. This is a great buy for those that love the Age of Empire set. Brought back some good memories."
4385,5,This is our new favorite game! The songs are great.  The game records a video and actually makes me look like a good dancer! Everyone in the family plays this.
4386,5,"First get rid of those crappy thermal pads on the back of microcrap and replace them with these, they work great and also create a barrier between the metal chassis and circutry."
4387,5,"This is the best MMORPG expansion I have seen of any game. There is a ton to do and the box entitles you to an additional ""soul"" for each ""calling"". The PvE content was quite engaging. Wonderful graphics and gear upgrades are done well."
4388,5,enjoy this game
4389,5,Wow. Another vehicle crossed off my collection list.
4390,5,this is a great game
4391,5,I don't know what else to say other than this is a well designed and good looking product that works well. 5 stars
4392,5,Good
4393,5,loved it
4394,5,"I believe the year was 1999 and I would play this game with 3 other friends all day, every day. It was like we were hooked. Proximity mines, rockets, power weapons we played it all. The single player is amazing as well. Just an all time classic that never gets old."
4395,5,"This product meets all expectations that I needed.
I like the state as arrival at their destination. Brand new.
I highly recommend this product for its excellent quality.
The quality and functionality of the item is much better than similar."
4396,5,"I had loser my old one and when I got this one, I was excited again to play all my old games! Worked amazingly and was just like old times."
4397,5,"Works great for the younger game players , I bought this one for my Grandson for Christmas he is just 5 years old and he loves it and he is able to play with the wireless controllers being a plus.."
4398,5,"I didn't pick up last year's game because of all the negative reviews, no fielding, etc.  So I waited...and waited.  I picked up a new VMU for the 180 blocks required for WSB2K2 and loaded it up.  This game is quality...the motion capture is superb, there's obviously a great deal of thought that went into it from a baseball standpoint.
The scores of the games I've been playing, 9-6, 1-0 (A great pitching matchup with Shawn Estes versus Kevin Brown, sole run was a Rich Aurilia home run), 6-4...and the flow of the game is quite close to a real baseball game.  You'll hit streaks where you can hit nothing but fly balls and ground outs, then you'll feel sorry for the CPU when you score 6 runs in one inning.  I'm playing on Pro mode, which I switched to quickly from Rookie.  Rookie is absurd; you can see the location of the ball the CPU is pitching to before they pitch and you can position your cursor right on the ball.
The 180 blocks is justified by the expansive franchise feature.  It's fun trading for players to update the league, but...one major oversight was that you cannot trade more than one player for a single player.  This means you can't trade three average players for one good player.  So you could probably never acquire Curt Schilling unless you gave up Barry Bonds.
One thing I don't like about the commentary is that after a big moment, a grand slam or something, he moves right onto the next batter like nothing happened.  The animations after a player hits a home run are somewhat repetetive.  I find it hard to believe Jeff Kent would be pumping his fist like a madman...they should've added a classy jog minus the fist pumping.
I like the batting stances for the most part.  The thing is the height of the players is identical, and Livan Hernandez can hit with the same power as Barry Bonds, it seems.
But all in all, I am having lots of fun playing the games...there are night games and day games.  The scoreboard always reflects the proper score and it is subtle in the background.  If you want a solid and entertaining baseball game, take it from a baseball fan, this is a good pick."
4399,5,What people said is true.  This is one of the best COD games.
4400,5,Very fun
4401,5,"This game is awesome! If you like shoot em ups,this game is for you. A great 1st person shooter with great graphics."
4402,5,great game
4403,5,Awesome Game.....Love the open world
4404,5,"Ghost Trick was made by the same developers who brought us the fantastic Phoenix Wright series (of which I am a huge fan) so I always intended to pick it up.  Unfortunately, I got distracted by other games and didn't get to it immediately.  Anyway, because I'm aware that the Phoenix Wright series was made by the same developers, a few comparisons between that series and this game are kind of inevitable.  I will try to be objective and take this game on it's own merits, though - it's only fair.

Graphics (score 10/10): Let's start off with something that I don't usually talk about in a review: the cover art.  Is that not the most embarrassing position ever to die in?  The cover is just hilarious!  That alone is worth the existence of this game.  As for the actual in-game graphics, it's not the clearest thing I've ever seen, but the environments are highly detailed, with a lot of moving parts, so I forgive it.  There are also nicely drawn portraits that appear when characters speak.

Music (score 10/10): No voice acting, but the music is very good.  It's catchy, full of character, and it definitely helps add emotional weight to the scenes.  In fact, it's some of the best music I've heard on a DS game.

Characters (score 9/10): If you're familiar with Phoenix Wright, then you'll know what I mean when I say that this game is full of similar quirky characters.  However, I feel that Ghost Trick has a distinctively different flavor compared to Phoenix Wright. You're main character is Sissel, who is actually an amnesiac ghost who's recently died (hence the title ""Ghost Trick"").  He sets off on a quest to figure out exactly who he is.  There's also Lynne, a spunky red-haired  detective.  All the characters feel amusing and have well written dialogue (even the minor characters, like the security guard who does the ""Panic Dance"", are memorable), yet they have some emotional depth to them.  I can't say that they are quite as endearing or memorable as the people from PW, but they are very good (there's even a dog named Missile - I can't help wondering if this is a reference to the ""Missile"" from PW).  You'll develop some attachment to these fictional people before the end of the game, and you'll genuinely come to care whether they live or die (even the one's who are already dead!).  My only complaint is that something happens later that makes me identify a bit less with Sissel, but I don't want to give it away; he's still likable, I'm just a bit disappointed with the big identity reveal.  Still, the characters in general are very lovable and I'm quite pleased.

Story (score 10/10): The story begins with your main character, Sissel, dying in the most embarrassing position possible.  He remarks that he would like to save the life of the woman who's being held at gunpoint, but that he can't because he's dead.  Your first order of business is to figure out how to do things as a ghost, and to save that woman.  Your overall purpose, though, is to find out who murdered you and who you really are.  Of course, over the course of the game, the story unfolds into a complicated mystery, and the writing is fantastic.  I won't give anything away, but let's just say that it's excellent and it's been a long time since I've played a game with a story this good.  I was absolutely riveted the whole way through.

Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  You basically play as poor Sissel (a ghost) and you can possess objects that are close to each other.  Some objects can be ""tricked"" -basically manipulated- into moving in some way (like opening a cabinet door).  It plays out with Rube Goldberg-type puzzles where you have to cleverly move from one object to another or set them into motion in a chain reaction of some kind in order to reach your goal.  He also has the ability to rewind to 4 minutes before the death of other people and potentially use his powers to save their lives (Unfortunately, he can't do this on himself.  Poor Sissel).  Yes, there is a real timer going on during these segments.  Now, before you freak out and run away, do not fret, it's not so bad.  If you fail, you don't get an annoying ""game over"" screen with a bunch of loading, you just get to try again.  You can also rewind whenever you want if you've messed up.  Timers in games never sound fun, but this game mechanic is surprisingly fun.  It's super fun figuring out how to achieve your goal by jumping between objects and making things happen.  There's even instances where timing is important to solving the puzzle (like if a paper is in mid-air - you may need to jump to it before it hits the ground).  Don't fret though, when you are in ""ghost mode"" (that's when you are moving between objects) the screen (and any timer) freezes so you have plenty of time to make your move.  So, you see, it's not a bad thing (even though sometimes it can be tricky trying to figure out what you need to do exactly).  I had a ton of fun with this game.  There's really only one complaint that I have: the saving.  If you save in the middle of a stage, then turn off the machine and start it up later, you have to start from the beginning of the stage all over again instead of where you saved!  It's madness.  Still, I can't really count off the score for such a small quibble when everything else is so fantastic.

Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  This is one of the most unique point and click adventure/puzzle games I've playing in a long time.  The gameplay mechanics are solid and fun, the story is deeply engaging, the music is a delight for the ears, and the characters are lovable and endearing.  You can't get much better than that.  The game is pretty short (about 10-15 hours), but given how good it is, it's still well worth your purchase.  Go ahead and give it a try; being dead has never been so fun."
4405,5,Great game. I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it. Great service and fast shipping.
4406,5,"Given that I'm an avid COD player and enjoyed the games in the series, I decided to buy some Battlefield games to give them a try, and Battlefield: Bad Company was one of them. And I must say, I wasn't at all disappointed. I absolutely love this game. The story is very immersing and it makes you want to know what's going to happen next, and the gameplay is great, though the controls are bit different from your typical COD controls, but that's okay. You'll be playing in no time since it doesn't really take that long to get used to the layout. Your health in this game is measured by numbers (you start at 100) instead of a regular heath bar or by how many shots you can take before you die. There is no health regeneration system used in this game, so if you're planning on hiding behind cover while your health regenerates, good luck with that, because it's not going to happen. Instead, you're given an auto-injector, similar to health packs used to heal yourself in other video games. The auto-injector will be with you at all times and will never automatically be switched out with other items. You get an infinite supply of them and it will instantly refill your health back up to 100 when it's used, however there is a small meter on the lower right corner that will deplete once it's used. So if you use one, and then randomly get shot and want to use it again, you'll have to wait until the meter refills. It doesn't take too long for the meter to fill up, so you should be good. There is also quite a bit of humor in this game too, though it's mostly small arguments consisted between your character and the other three main characters. It is an open world type of game complete with collectible weapons and gold bars that you can search for. The gold bars are explained through the story. Don't worry though. It's optional. It's not required for you to find every weapon or gold bar in order to progress through the game. Even though it's an open world type of game, most of the map will be shaded in red, meaning that if you go to these areas, the game will give you a five second warning to get back to the battle zone before ending the mission which I find to be a bit unfair since I love exploring different areas in video games. However, these red areas will eventually vanquish as you progress through the missions, allowing you to finally access these areas. At any point during the game, you can choose to commandeer vehicles such as tanks, humvees, boats and helicopters to help you progress through the game. The game is played in first person view, however whenever you are driving a vehicle, you do have the option to switch to a 3rd person type of view (behind the vehicle). This game also has realistic environmental destruction, meaning that you can blow holes in walls of buildings with explosives, blast down doors, and even knock down trees. Overall, with the open world exploration, environmental destruction and commandeering of vehicles, this game definitely reminded me a lot of Mercenaries: Playground Of Destruction for the PS2. I've also played Batllefield: Bad Company 2, but this game definitely tops it. To me, Bad Company 2 just wasn't as fun nor as intriguing as the first one was and it seemed a little bit more linear rather than taking things at your own pace like you could in the first one. If you enjoy military games, funny humor, blowing things up and exploration, definitely give this one a try, you won't be disappointed."
4407,5,Great game fast shipping!
4408,5,"Played before, but love the new additions that were not available with the 360 version."
4409,5,These help me play and not get as frustrated. My fingers don't slip off and it's just more fun to play. Playing Modern Warfare 2 with these is so much easier to throw grenades for me.
4410,5,"Nice Price, very good card, still working and a big memory to stor my games."
4411,5,I like the game
4412,5,"Bought this for my little brother and he loves it. Two great games, all the DLC for a good price! What else is not to love here."
4413,5,"Fun game, not to much different than other Call Of Duty games, aside from the jump boost and some of the scopes. Zombies is a blast"
4414,5,"Personally, I am no good with it. I wind up crashing. But all of my grandsons and sons can make it through winning. They like to play, and it doesn't have the violence in it or cursing."
4415,5,this is without a doubt the best ncaa version to come out yet the dynasty mode is drastically better while recruiting you actually have interaction with your recruits which to me makes it a little more difficult but also adds to the excitement of the game because it is you tryiung to land the big recruit not the comp the playcalling is also 100 times better and  i also like that all of the achievements are based on regular gameplay not xbox live this is a must get if u even slightly like football
4416,5,"It work as well as my G700, but with battery life that makes it actually practical to use as a wireless mouse.  Great shape, textures, button layout, and tracking.  The only things the G700 has on it are wheel functions: I miss the express scroll function a lot, and not having side scrolling on the wheel is slightly missed."
4417,5,good.
4418,5,Gift
4419,5,"Great game, the graphics are good, the music too, and the gameplay is awesome, i recommend to everybody, buy this game !!!"
4420,5,Does what it says. Open all my games and lets me clean them out or fix the guts of the game.
4421,5,"The Playstation 2 console is most likely the best selling video game console in the history of the industry. The reasons for this include the consoles amazing technical specs and its large library of games. This perticular version of the console, is the slim version. This means that its size has been shrunk and that now the games are loded through the top, instead of the sliding tray in the original model. I have to admit that the size of this console impressed me a great deal. It is amazing how such a powerful piece of hardware can be put into such a small console. As I previously mentioned, the game library for the Playstation 2 is gigantic. This mainly stems from the system's backwards compatability with the original Playstation, which means that all of the games for the original Playstation will play on the Playstation 2. The only downside to this item is that it only comes with one controller and no memory card. It would nice, if the video game industry would understand that if they are going to make memory cards so essiential to the gaming experience they might want to include them with the console. This minor gripe aside, this console is the best deal for both your money and your gaming experience and is only outdone by the classic consoles of the past from Nintindo and Sega."
4422,5,"More lego dimension sets.
Kids seem to want them all..
Started putting them together with model glue as we get them
so we don't end up with little lego parts all over the house.
Seems to work well."
4423,5,son says this game is very cool graphics are great
4424,5,This was my son's Christmas present. He loves it. Thank you so much.
4425,5,"I bought this at Wal Mart for $130 (and the game is around $30 just by itself).
Very well made with attention to every detail. I'm the type of person that will hold onto something and take care of it rather than (just get another one if I don't take care of it) and I really like the dust-proof case for the system.
The ""game"" is great and it also has Sudoku as an ""extra"" but Sudoku can apparently also help with keeping your brain in tip top shape. I had NEVER been drawn to Sudoku - I think because I really don't like math games - but this is GREAT. There are places to put little numbers in each square til you're sure it's the right number for the space so there is no scribbling/erasing."
4426,5,it plays good. i would tell people about this game. would like to get more games for my wii game.
4427,5,"As was the case with the original Sims, Sims 2 proves to be a great hit, and a highly addictive game for many.

Over the original Sims-

PROS:

Building: houses can be more than 2 stories, and have decks.

Growth: children go through various stages of development and growth. How well you raise them, and how well their individual needs are met can affect how they grow up.

Aging: although many people turn this feature off, I enjoy playing with aging turned on. Sims needs and desires change over time. After they turn into an elder, they collect retirement money from their job.

For Hire: parents can now hire a nanny to ""raise"" the children while they are at work, which means social services won't come take the crying baby away if he/she is accidentally left at home. Nanny is especially helpful for when children are babies. Not a good idea to utilize them a lot when baby turns to a toddler, as the nanny will only, at best, take care of the child's most basic needs. Nanny will not teach the child to walk, talk or use the potty. And speaking of the potty- nanny will often not flush after she goes. eww!

Love bed: Sims can do 'woohoo' in any 2-person bed, or hot tub. They can also do woohoo in public places, such as a dressing room. If your sim is love-oriented, they will desire to do this often. Sims can also choose to woohoo or try to conceive a baby. This means that yuppy sims with nice jobs can get lots of action, without the responsibility of having a child.

Love is a social disease: Sims can meet social needs by chatting online or on the phone.

Party Hardy: Sims can now throw specialized parties, such as house party, birthday party, and wedding. Specific items for each occasion can be purchased, such as wedding or birthday cake, a wedding arbor to get married under. Sims can pop the bubbly and toast to other sims. When wedding or birthday cake is cut, the sims gather round' and celebrate. Note: if you have the plasma TV, get rid of it during parties, or all your guests will head right towards it, and will spend a large chunk of time watching it.

Hot for Teacher: Sims with a school-aged child can invite the headmaster over for dinner. If your house and food is high enough caliber, your child will be allowed to get in. If you have any furnishings in your yard that shouldn't be there (beds, etc) or the love tub, the headmaster will leave immediately, even if your home is otherwise expensively decorated and furnished. Getting into private school is important, and the better education will supposedly help your sims grow up better.

CONS:

Object rotation: this is far worse in Sims 2. Often, windows which are placed while viewing the home from the outside front, are placed backwards. Rotation is near impossible at times. Frustrating! Rotation was much easier in the original Sims.

Repairing: it seems like things in my home break every single day. Toilets clog daily, even though my sims are clean and always flush. I usually have the repair guy out every day.

Homework: Sim children have homework. The downside is that if they don't do their homework, their grades suffer. An even larger downside is that your sim children will drop their homework anywhere in the house, and finding it can sometimes be difficult. I've tried placing desks near the front door, but they always leave it on the floor.

The Dingo ate my baby: As is the case with homework, the baby is often misplaced. Members of the family will often set the baby down on the floor and walk away. They will do this a lot in the kitchen, after bottle feeding. The kitchen cabinets and table can make it difficult to see where the baby is. If you ""lose"" your baby, then simply click on the crib, and tell you sim to place the baby in the crib. They will go and get the baby from whatever location it is in.

Also, many of my sims ""argue"" over the baby, making carrying out tasks with baby to be frustrating. I can have my mom sim feeding the baby, after she's done, she will set baby down for a moment, before picking him up to go change his diaper. In that moment, 1-3 other sims will come over, all with the intent of taking the baby. I've had to fight over babies more times than I want to think about.

I'm with stupid: my sims are so incredibly stupid sometimes. Even with free will turned on, they will stand there crying and whimpering because their 'fun' meter is completely red. Instead of going and watching TV or playing computer....they pace the house crying, or talk to other sims. They also will often cook for only themselves, even though they're a parent to 5 children. A family-minded sim should cook and serve family meals most of the time, not just make themselves a bowl of mac and cheese.

Second verse, same as the first: Unfortunately, EA didn't change furnishings as much as most sims fanatics would have liked. Although most furnishings have multiple colors of the same items, we have very few choices. If you want a high-comfort couch, you only have 2-3 styles to choose from. Same with beds, chairs, etc. I like to play the game to build and furnish an interesting house. If I want my sims to be comfortable, I only have a few furniture choices.

Grow up already: Sims can bring a friend home from school (randomly game-generated) or meet other sims that don't live in their neighborhood. In one case, my sim teen fell deeply in love with another sim. She could call and invite him over, but eventually, she grew into an adult. Since the boy did not live in her neighborhood, I could not play as him and allow him to age, which meant their now adult/child relationship was immediately turned into a platonic one.

Teen Love: Teenagers can kiss, hug, and make out, but not have teen sex. Why not? Teen pregnancy could have been an interesting stir-up for this game. Also, why not throw in some STDs. Little Sally Sim may get straight A's in school, but we all know she'd love to bang the entire football team. She could pick up herpes, and lose some body or health points. Stir it up, EA!!

BUGS:

I have no add-ons, downloads or anything in this game other than what came on the EA CD. I never had any problems with this game, until I downloaded EA's latest update. Big mistake. Since then:

Bubble butt: my sims will occasionally get bubble coming out of their rear-ends after swimming. The only thing that seems to resolve this, is if they go swimming again.

Swing low: the headmaster will occasionally get sidetracked while at the house, and will spend hours on the swingset. It's near impossible to get him off of it, and get him to eat and tour the house.

The sound of music: I'll occasionally get repeating sound issues, and the game has to be shut down to fix this. Very annoying.

Eternal Sleep: A sleeping sim will often stay in bed for hours and hours after their sleep bar is full. Even if they're hungry and need a shower, they remain sleeping until I manually wake them up. (free will is on)

Overall, this is an excellent game. The graphics, 3-D rotating camera, and sim interactions are all excellent. The ability to shape and grow your own sim children is the most satisfying aspect of this game, in my opinion. Definitely worth buying."
4428,5,this is a awesome game it is fun and enjoyable to play I love the fact that u can upgrade the costumes like they are other characters. this is a fun game. I enjoyed it a lot. if you have not played this game then I recommend you do
4429,5,The game itself is just AWESOME.... the only thing is that i did not get it the release date as amazon promissed.. 2 days later after the official release I got my game..
4430,5,Thanks
4431,5,"Blizzard did mighty well in this game series, wish they would have delivered the same to Warcraft.  Collectors edition was a must."
4432,5,"This game sure comes with some serious pedigree: Travis Baldree, designer of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fate/dp/B002L7GKXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fate</a>, and Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer, co-designers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diablo-I/dp/B00001IVBL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diablo I</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/II/dp/B0002BQN7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">II</a>&nbsp;put their heads together and came up with an action hack&slash isometric RPG game that can appeal to all ages. The result is a good game that will keep us hacking and summoning - until the ...3rd coming that is.

In fact, the game developers made sure to often pay tribute to the DIABLO Series: from the background music while at the town-camp (you would recognize those Tristam guitar riffs anywhere!), to the draining health and mana fountains and to the voice announcing & warning, you cannot miss the timeless DIABLO influences. Having said that, I found TORCHLIGHT to be something between a DIABLO and a FATE game.

If you have experienced any of the FATE games you will be reminded of them often, although the heroes here are not children. The village NPCs will keep giving you straightforward quests (usually a go-and-fetch excuse to dwell deeper into the dungeon). Extra dungeons, however, can be accessed by accepting the extra quests of the male NPC in the south and by purchasing dungeon maps of various levels from the local merchants. Also, sometimes a spectral animal appears while in a dungeon: slaying it will open up a bonus dungeon where better equipment often becomes available. There is no traveling to/from town while in a bonus dungeon, so you better keep an empty inventory before entering it.
Yes, you do get a pet (a dog or a cat - but you can interchange them by purchasing and feeding them a special fish) and, yes, you can transform them by feeding them different types of fishes. Fishing is carried out in pretty much the same fashion: you wait for two concentric circles to merge and their color to change from pale blue to purple but it is less important than it was in FATE (so far I brought in nothing else but fish - no equipment or valuable items).

Now, when not playing an AD&D RPG (where I always choose to be a Paladin), I like to play other RPGs as a warlock, a fighting mage. The Alchemist class allows you to both cast powerful spells and exchange blows in the midst of the action (the other available classes is the Destroyer and the Vanquisher). The Destroyer is the up-close-and-personal tank warrior whereas the Vanquisher is the ranger.
When leveling up as an Alchemist, make sure to get both the (steampunk!) golems and the Ember Strike spell. Together with some good shielding spells, nothing can stand in your way.

Try not to go broke. At first I though, ""finally, an RPG that is not stingy with its money"". But that was only at first. Items are less expensive at the shops but (surprise!) they also sell for a pittance. The good news is that money drops like rain from slain foes. The money-hole is the enchanter: attempting to further enchant your equipment will deplete your funds faster than you would imagine! And you also run a considerable risk of having all of its enchantments removed. No post-dated checks are honored. No credit cards accepted. I tried.

You WILL get swarmed so be prepared. Place healing potions, defensive and knockback spells on quick-slots (1-0); equip your pet with self or group healing spells and a powerful summoning spell; and never forget to first stay alive and then keep pounding on your enemies. In the heat of the battle it is best to deactivate (Alt-key) the fallen-items labels (more on this later on) and to always keep an eye on your health and mana levels. Respawning is not free: it will cost you either time, money or experience.

The inventory seems small but, in fact, it is more than adequate. Potions and scrolls are stackable up to 20 and (more importantly) every item takes up only one inventory square (no, you do not have to carry your fishing pole, it is just there).
You can send your pet to town to sell off its inventory and the time it needs to return is much less that what it did in FATE.
And there are treasure rooms you can only access by finding and pulling levers (sometimes in specific sequence) to open doors or turn bridges.

Now, some negative points:
(1) the game is only a dungeon crawler, there are no outdoors locations.
(2) the graphics of the the spells are very impressive but they can become really confusing as well. Even at maximum settings, unless the fallen-items labels are deactivated you will not be able to actually see much of the battle. That means alternating between fighting and looting - but it also means missing some important interactive objects (levers or ballistas). Also, when electric, fire, ice and poison spells get mixed the result is not something one can discern friend from foe in. It makes no tactical difference (you cannot harm yourself or your company) but it sure would be more enjoyable if you could aim more than...80% of the time.
(3) the environments are beautifully designed but your path is often blocked by obstacles that visually you could easily bypass. Sometimes you find your hero running in place, stopped by a ...pebble.

Finally, some closing suggestions to the developers for a future patch: (a) add the possibility to order our pet to bring back potions and identification scrolls when sent into town, and (b) make it possible to change class in mid-game (keeping the level and redistributing the skill points).

All in all, TORCHLIGHT is a very enjoyable experience. It is easy to master, it is beautiful and it is fun for the whole family.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4433,5,Got my xbox one i play this game on my brother house and is epiiic...only multiplayer but is cool..anyway after u finish the campaing in most of the games u never try it again... But the multiplayer u always doooo
4434,5,"Street Fighter games have always been my favorite games around, and when I heard that Third Strike was coming to Dreamcast, I quickly pre-ordered a copy. This game is a BLAST! Sure, there's only 19 fighters to choose from, but the selection is great. The difficulty is strangely hard. Even on the easiest setting, I still had a heck of a time betting the game with Akuma. The last boss, Gill, is so cheap with his attacks that I almost pulled my hair out every time I fought him. That's my only gripe. Its a great game, with some depth with learning parrying and mastering all of the super arts. A must own for any Street Fighter fan."
4435,5,I LOVE IT IT IS SO COOL AD FUN
4436,5,"excellent brand, good product quality a product feature that I recommend to anyone."
4437,5,I do like the game but it got boring after a few times of beating the game.
4438,5,Enjoyed this game. Spent many hours working on it. I look forward to playing games similar to this one in the future.
4439,5,Great
4440,5,There are a lot of free downloadable games and you will not have a bunch of games laying around.

4446,5,"This game has found a permanent place in my PS4 game collection.  It's my third Square Enix video game, with the other two being ""Just Cause 2"" (PS3; Excellent game) and ""Hitman: Absolution"" (PS3; mediocre) and I have nothing negative to say about it.  This game brings about a great balance of game-play, storyline, graphics, sound-engineering, AI, adventure and length.  It's fun, fun, and more fun end-to-end.  There are not that many PS4 games out there (yet) so if you want to start your PS4 experience, I highly recommend Tomb Raider!  Happy gaming..."
4447,5,"This game boy comes with a built in lightwith a light switch,well thats good news,but The Game Boy Advance SP is a lott smaller then the standard Game Boy Advance and can fold up like a tinylaptop computer when not being played. And it doesnt use any standard batteries,the Game Boy Advance SP needs to charge like a regular cell phone with an AC adapter. A Lithium ion battery is built in and cannot be removed or replaced. Nintendo claims that with 3 hours of charging equals 10 hours of play or 18 if you don't use the light.but the AC adapter can be used as a regular power source so you can play the Game Boy  Advance SP can be played while plugged into the wall. The Game Boy Advance SP will have the standard D-pad ,A and B buttons plus START and SELECT.The L and R buttons are smaller and are placed behind the flip top screen. A new Front Light Screen (FLS) button has been added just under the display that functions as the off/on switch for the light. A new sliding volume switch is located on the right side. Games will be inserted from the bottum of the unit instead of from the top like the regular Game Boy Advance and the original. In addition the Game Boy Advance games,the Game Boy Advance SP will also support old and new Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. The games with the built in sensors like Kirby's Tilt'N'Tumble may not work  properly with this unit  because  the cartridge would be flipped upside down during play. The new Game Boy Advance SP screen is the same exact size as the regular Game Boy Advance screen. The Game Boy Advance SP will come with a AC adapter and headphone adapter. The headphone adapter will be required for any regular headphone set since the Game Boy Advance SP doesnt have a mini-plug input. In fact the headphone adapter uses the  same port as the AC adapter ,so using headphones while the unit is  plugged into the AC adapter would be impossible. Another concern is that Nintendo is still struggling  to come up with with a solution for consumers if their internal Lithium ion battery  dies from overuse. Three colors are offered in Japan:cobalt,platinum,and black. But in the U.S. only two colors are offered:cobalt and platinum. In the U.S. the Game Boy Advance SP will be available ... on March 23one day before the release of the game The Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker for the Gamecube.

4448,5,EXCELLENT GAME!
4449,5,Little noisy but works great.
4450,5,good
4451,5,The thumb rest was hard to get used to. The available software is good. The current Duracell battery has lasted two months on eco-mode. I had missed click until I put the USB receiver on the same side of my laptop that I use the mouse.
4452,5,"This item is exactly as advertised: plug up to 2 DS3 controllers into it and they charge.  For me, this is perfect because before I was having to swap controllers out from a single usb cable attached to the usb ports on the front of my PS3.  It's not exactly the sturdiest thing I've ever bought, but for the price, it'll do."
4453,5,Very satisfied customer!
4454,5,"Its got all the right ingredients. variety, challenge, amazing surprises, and tremendous fun. the backrounds always make me wanna buy crayons and draw too."
4455,5,"Yes, the enemies never permanently go away. Getting anywhere in this game is quite a challenge. But if you accept that this game is simply about getting places and doing things without dying, and progressing to bigger and badder weapons all the time, this game will hook you into its world.

When I was done, I felt like I'd really become a complete badass.

Things will happen to you in this game which you'll want to tell your friends about. And almost none of it is pre-scripted. The game is a triumph of system-based game design. Very immersive. I always find myself wanting to go back to it. Arguably, Far Cry 2 is a classic."
4456,5,"I kind of miss this game, that was my favorite PS2 games since I was 1th grade during my school year of 2001/2002."
4457,5,Great
4458,5,The game arrived.
4459,5,"""Top Gun: Combat Zones,"" which is what it is really called, is a game which has devoted nearly its full potential to providing an arcade experience to those who do not want to spend tons of quarters actually in the arcade.  You are a pilot, whether one for the NAVY is to be considered and debated, and your primary goal is to complete the mulitiple primary goals to survive the missions.  Life is a tough one in ""Combat Zones,"" to the point where afterburner conservation is a major element to success or failure.

You begin in an F-14 Tomcat with the most realistic capabilities for a game where 20 missiles are not uncommon, and start your training to hell and back again with astonishing level of tension.  To unlock more modes and planes, you must complete ""Eras"" that have both a ""Academy"" (Which is a major downfall, you can't skip the academy, although it is still extremely fun), and a ""Warzone.""  For you Flight Simulator fans, it is extremely realistic and you can see flaps, ailerons, and elevators to the finest details.  The F-22, which you unlock as soon as you get to the 3rd Era, even has vectoring thrust.

The game graphics are nearly superb, but some smoke effects would have been nice.  If you destroy a target, it will just vanish, with no smoke or something.  Ground objects are good, but not perfect, and there are no ""invisible barriers"" that you would magically crash into.

The gameplay was around 6-12 hours.

Overall, a good game."
4460,5,"I really love it, Great game"
4461,5,"Amazing game!! Want to play it all the time but can't because my hands begin to hurt!! So many quests and side things to solve, I have barely worked on the main quest and have had it for weeks."
4462,5,Awesome! Thank you!!!!
4463,5,"I literally sneak into every minutes I could spare into this game since the first day I got this game. Usually, I play the xbox on nightly basis until my friend suggested me to try this first then onto borderlands 2, I could even play in the daylight and doesn't feel as drained as the other games made me to feel hence night time play. The game play itself is simply perfect (I hate the junkyard part, it makes me want to go inside the game and clean it up) and the concept is flawless no matter what my likes/dislikes were, it got me playing constantly.

This game is the opposite of Call of Duty: Ghosts, if you like being led to do what they want you to do, you won't like borderlands.  I seek games that allows you to be independent and form your own strategy with tasks of your choice and borderlands has it all."
4464,5,love it great deal
4465,5,I completed it with all achievements using a keyboard.  There are some glitches so sometimes you need to restart checkpoints but the game is so good it's not that big a deal.  If you like a emotional story and great artwork you should like this game.  it's even better with someone to share it with.
4466,5,Awesome game with stunning images. All Pokemon fans should get some joy out of it.
4467,5,"This is an awesome game with stunning graphics, and a cool storyline. Great finales to the Arkham Series."
4468,5,I love all the games
4469,5,"fantastic goods and delivery

Great service, great product,
Item as expected, A+++"
4470,5,The king of the original Fire Emblem games in that came to the west. A harsh but fair system where the enemies are hard and the weak are easily weeded out
4471,5,"Great product, recommend it for any gamer."
4472,5,Very fun game! 5 all day son!
4473,5,Great puzzles.  So many different kinds not just hidden objects.
4474,5,"This is a great game. It has a great story line, great action and some naked chicks... never a bad thing. I will most definetly be buying God of War II."
4475,5,This is a great game. Another must have for the 3DS/2DS. I highly recommend it.

From the safety of their living room.

The Collector's Edition comes packaged in a Pip-Boy Crate. Press the side latches to open the center. Inside, you'll find the centerpiece PIP-BOY and the game placed stealthily at the top.  The game comes in a metal case.  Also included is a large fold out ""map"" featuring the Perks for Fallout 4.

The Pip-Boy itself is the main reason you're reading. It's surprising sturdy, made with hard plastic and two metal clasps. Inside is a foam insert so your arm fits comfortably. There is also a velcro strap to ensure it doesn't fall off or move around. My forearm is quite large and I find the velcro to be unnecessary.

The top opens up to reveal the compartment where you can rest your phone. I have a Galaxy s5. It did NOT fit well. I had to press very hard to make it fit, and while it did, I needed to get a hard, flat object (I used a sculptor's file) to get it back out. Despite not fitting well, the app looks amazing set inside the Pip-Boy. It DOES link up with your game and you can manually navigate through the menu screens, check your map, and all the other functions of the Pip-Boy featured in the game.

It comes with a nice stand that you can set it on if you'd rather admire it or when you need a break from killing deathclaws (radroaches for you greenhorns).

I did do one boneheaded thing - I did not read the instructional manual before checking out the Pip-Boy. Because of this, I discovered some of the ""interactive"" buttons and dials to be a bit flimsy. You can twist and turn a few of them, but as you can see in one of the photos, I ended up popping the top button (7 in the manual) in. I mistakenly thought this was the way to open the top. Even though I'm disappointed and a little sad that I've already broken my Pip-Boy (Bethesda - any suggestions?), it still looks very nice and will be an excellent addition to my collector's shelf.

All in all, if you can afford to purchase the Pip-Boy Edition and are a fan of Fallout, I recommend grabbing one. The Pip-Boy is fantastically designed, and unlike some collector's editions, looks built to last.

Final Verdict: Great Purchase!"
4477,5,"I got this DS for a girl I like (I'm such a wuss), and she seemed to enjoy it, because I bought it with New Super Mario Bros DS game.

Very cool color, it stands out from the white DS (mine) and the black one, which is ever so opaque that I really don't like.

Nothing different than the color, though."
4478,5,"This is the evolution of the RPG I played as a child.  This game takes heroes, villains, plots, character personalities, leveling systems, and pushes them all to the next level.  Fantastic voice overs, you have the opportunity to listen to hundreds of side conversations along the journey to get insight into your unlikely team of heroes.  Easily 80 hours of content.  Tons of optional content all throughout the game.  An amazing product, one of the few quality rpgs in the past few years.  Kudos Namco!"
4479,5,"Best racing game I've ever played hands down. This game's environments are absolutely beautiful. I like the more realistic racing games but not like being stuck on a track. With this you can choose to race in numerous different environments with multiple race types. You can also just cruise around if youd like. It also has extensive multiplayer modes. There are different customization options for cars which allow for car enthusiast to change specific parts on the car/ truck or a automatic upgrade option for players who arnt that familiar with car workings. The game itself has tons of replayability. Its also one you can just pick up play for 5 minutes do a single race or play for 8 hours straight. If you like racing simulators or arcade racing this is the perfect combo of both.

The only con I have is that they have those car packs they sell. The game has tons of cars if you don't buy the other car packs but I guess I'm old fashioned but i don't believe you should have to pay for extra things in games you should be able to unlock them."
4480,5,I bought these as replacements for our dsi and ds lite it works great for both of them as my pen got lost that my ds lite came with these are great items to have especially around toddlers the item arrived early and packaging was great no damage at all I will order more from seller again
4481,5,good game recomended
4482,5,"Ordered through Sewell, fast shipping and cheap.  I noticed the arcade stick doesn't work on one of the Guilty Gear series (ps2), Tekken 5, and Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha 2.  It's compatible on the PSONE for those who are still interested in.  PS3, no problem checked with BlazBlue and SF4.  Works flawlessly on all of my emulators (ZSNES, NESTEN, NESTOPIA, DGEN, ETC...)  Makes the games more enjoyable, nothing like blasting aliens and jumping on SMB3 on an arcade stick.  I won't spend anymore than $50 on one."
4483,5,The PS3 felt like PS vita coming out the box. It was small and stunning. Perfect. I love the fact that it doesn't heat up my room like the original fat boy. I just replaced my fat boy 80gb with this new slim and it fits perfect. Especially if your a person who requires more space in your room as well as more room on your hard drive. Why Not? and you get assassin's Creed III. I am done. Buy the bundle.
4484,5,"Easy to program and love it. Works with fallout, Just Cause 3,  battle field hardline,  star Wars battlefront.  Please remember the programming blue lights are located where the guides would go if you needed to add the keyboard to the controller.
  Customer service is at the TOP OF THERE GAME.  Thanks to you"
4485,5,"Easily got 40+ hours of play time out of this. great voice acting, great animation, great environments, Does justice to LOTR. The open world plays very similar to Asassin's Creed games."
4486,5,Very nice game
4487,5,great game
4488,5,"I picked this game up a few days ago, I usually favor the college football games but there aren't any available for the next generation systems so I went with there pro counterpart.

The grapics ARE updated not matter what other people are saying they might need so glasses or try being honest. The gameplay has a very realistic this time around. I find the game really fun no complaints here."
4489,5,Even better than the original.
4490,5,"It's a very good game, and I found it very entertaining. Wario World: Reign of Wah offers an interesting and refreshing platforming experience.

Pros:
- Wario is over-powered, but in the fun way
- This game had Puzzle Rooms before Kirby: Planet Robobot (2016) made them popular
- Wario's enemies are not exactly over-powered but can be tough to deal with, so the game is very balanced in terms of difficulty

Cons:
- Well-worth the high price; it is a hidden gem (not unlike the kinds that are on the cover)

Your mileage may vary:
- You need to invest a relatively small amount of time to beat this game"
4491,5,"Es una excelente adquisicion, ya que da gran comodidad para colocar los controles, y al mismo tiempo cargar la bateria sin necesidad de quitarlas para recarga o utilizar cables.

Ya solo me falta comprar un par de baterias negras aparte para sustituir en mi par de controles extras. ;)"
4492,5,Arrived on time and as described
4493,5,Awesome
4494,5,"Absolutley love this game, in my opinion its the greatest fighting game ever created! I still own and play it and wouldnt part with it for any reason. As a youngster growing up in the arcade fighting game era in the early 90s I spent many hours popping quarters in Mortal Kombat and MK2 machines until the wonderfull christmas that I received my sega genesis, with MK 1 and 2 and street fighter 2 champions edition. The 32x port of this game was IMO the best arcade to console version of this title (although I have heard the saturn version was a bit better, but I never owned a saturn) Personally i always prefered the genesis ports of the fighting games and this one did not dissapoint. Strongly reccomend it to any genesis or fighting game collector, and the only reason i would reccomend chosing this title on any other system is if the buyer owns the genesis 32x adapter (I have genesis and the 32x versions, and the 32x version is an almost arcade perfect port) but i cant say id recomend buying the 32x adapter just for this game as there really weren't many good games for it, genesis version was awesome enough!"
4495,5,"Nice long micro USB cable, battery lasts a long time, seemingly longer than it did with AAs."
4496,5,I've been having a great time with this game. I love it.
4497,5,d
4498,5,"Really pretty, funny, interesting game. Works well. I recommend it for all ages."
4499,5,"i had a lot of fun playing this game, if your looking for a game to jump into with not much overthinking this is the game"
